# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Velocity_X

## Step 1: Adding Dependency

To get started with Velocity_X, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  velocity_x: ^3.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing Velocity_X

In your Dart files, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:velocity_x/velocity_x.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Velocity_X

You can now start using Velocity_X in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a responsive button using Velocity_X:

```dart
VxButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Button action
  },
  child: "Click Me".text.make(),
).centered();
```

This button will automatically adapt to the screen size and center itself in the available space.

With these steps, you are now ready to leverage the power of Velocity_X in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of Velocity_X in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:velocity_x/velocity_x.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Velocity_X Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: 'Velocity_X Demo',
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Using Velocity_X to create a responsive text widget
              "Welcome to Velocity_X".text.xl4.bold.make().p16(),
              
              // A button that uses Velocity_X for styling
              VxButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action when button is pressed
                  VxToast.show(context, msg: "Button Pressed!");
                },
                child: "Click Me".text.make(),
              ).p16().box.roundedLg.shadowSm.make(),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutterApp.
// 2. RealFlutterApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the text and button vertically.
// 5. The text widget is created using Velocity_X's text extension, making it larger and bold.
// 6. The button is created using VxButton, which shows a toast message when pressed.
// 7. The button is styled with padding, rounded corners, and a shadow using Velocity_X utilities.
```
