            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by initializing the FlutterAnalyzeReporter package.
// It then runs the RealFlutter app, which creates an instance of the reporter.
// The reporter is started in the initState method and stopped in the dispose method.
// The app displays the frame rate, memory usage, and CPU usage in the center of the screen.
// The values are updated in real-time by the reporter.
