# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using gif_view

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `gif_view` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gif_view: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using gif_view in Your Application

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display a GIF.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gif_view/gif_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('GIF View Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: GifView(
            image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/your_gif.gif'),
            // Set the width and height of the GIF
            width: 300,
            height: 300,
            // Control whether the GIF should loop
            repeat: true,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a GIF from a network source. The `GifView` widget is used to render the GIF, and you can customize its properties as needed.

# Complete Example of gif_view

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gif_view/gif_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('GIF View Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: GifView(
            image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/your_gif.gif'), // Load GIF from a network URL
            width: 300, // Set the width of the GIF
            height: 300, // Set the height of the GIF
            repeat: true, // Enable looping of the GIF
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function takes the RealFlutter widget and makes it the root of the widget tree.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the app structure.
// 4. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which provides the basic visual layout structure.
// 5. An AppBar is added to the Scaffold with the title 'GIF View Example'.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child.
// 7. The child of the Center widget is a GifView widget, which displays the GIF.
// 8. The GifView widget is configured to load a GIF from a network URL, with specified width and height, and set to repeat.
// 9. The application runs and displays the GIF in the center of the screen.
```
