# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Download Assets Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `download_assets` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `download_assets` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  download_assets: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the internet and write to external storage. Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
    
    <application
        android:label="yourapp"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save downloaded assets.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to download an asset and display its progress.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:download_assets/download_assets.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _progress = 0.0; // Variable to track download progress

  // Method to download an asset
  void _downloadAsset(String url) async {
    try {
      // Start downloading the asset
      await DownloadAssets.download(url, onProgress: (progress) {
        setState(() {
          _progress = progress; // Update progress
        });
      });
      // Notify user of completion
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Download completed!')),
      );
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors during download
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Download failed: $e')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Download Assets Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Download Progress: ${(_progress * 100).toStringAsFixed(0)}%'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Call the download method with a sample URL
                _downloadAsset('https://example.com/sample-image.jpg');
              },
              child: Text('Download Asset'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Downloading Assets

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:download_assets/download_assets.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _progress = 0.0; // Variable to track download progress

  // Method to download an asset
  void _downloadAsset(String url) async {
    try {
      // Start downloading the asset
      await DownloadAssets.download(url, onProgress: (progress) {
        setState(() {
          _progress = progress; // Update progress
        });
      });
      // Notify user of completion
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Download completed!')),
      );
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors during download
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Download failed: $e')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Download Assets Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Download Progress: ${(_progress * 100).toStringAsFixed(0)}%'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Call the download method with a sample URL
                _downloadAsset('https://example.com/sample-image.jpg');
              },
              child: Text('Download Asset'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(),
  ));
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the download progress.
// 3. When the user presses the "Download Asset" button, the _downloadAsset method is called with a sample URL.
// 4. The download process begins, and the progress is updated in real-time.
// 5. Once the download is complete, a SnackBar notification is shown to the user.
// 6. If the download fails, an error message is displayed in a SnackBar.
```
