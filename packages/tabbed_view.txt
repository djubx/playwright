# Tabbed View Flutter Package

The `tabbed_view` Flutter package is a powerful tool for creating tabbed interfaces in Flutter applications. It allows developers to easily implement tabbed navigation, providing a clean and organized way to display content. This package is particularly useful in applications where users need to switch between different views or categories of information without losing context.

## When to Use

You should consider using the `tabbed_view` package in scenarios such as:
- **Content Organization**: When you have multiple categories of content that can be grouped under tabs, such as settings, user profiles, or product categories.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Tabbed View Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `tabbed_view` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `tabbed_view` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tabbed_view: ^0.0.1  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a tabbed view.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tabbed_view/tabbed_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tabbed View Example',
      home: TabbedViewExample(),
    );
  }
}

class TabbedViewExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Tabbed View Example'),
      ),
      body: TabbedView(
        tabs: [
          Tab(text: 'Tab 1'),
          Tab(text: 'Tab 2'),
          Tab(text: 'Tab 3'),
        ],
        views: [
          Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 1')),
          Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 2')),
          Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 3')),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple tabbed view with three tabs, each displaying different content. You can customize the tabs and views as needed.

# Complete Example of Tabbed View

Below is a complete Flutter main file that demonstrates all key features of the `tabbed_view` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tabbed_view/tabbed_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tabbed View Example',
      home: TabbedViewExample(),
    );
  }
}

class TabbedViewExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Tabbed View Example'),
      ),
      body: TabbedView(
        tabs: [
          Tab(text: 'Tab 1'), // First tab
          Tab(text: 'Tab 2'), // Second tab
          Tab(text: 'Tab 3'), // Third tab
        ],
        views: [
          Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 1')), // Content for first tab
          Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 2')), // Content for second tab
          Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 3')), // Content for third tab
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to TabbedViewExample.
// 3. TabbedViewExample creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a TabbedView in the body.
// 4. The TabbedView contains three tabs, each associated with a view.
// 5. When a tab is selected, the corresponding content is displayed in the center of the screen.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this complete example, we have created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `tabbed_view` package. The application consists of three tabs, each displaying different content. The comments within the code explain the flow of the application step-by-step, making it easy to understand how the `tabbed_view` package works.

### Final Summary

The `tabbed_view` package provides a straightforward way to implement tabbed navigation in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, you can easily create a user-friendly interface that allows users to switch between different views seamlessly. The provided example illustrates how to set up the package and implement a basic tabbed view, making it a great starting point for your Flutter projects.
