# Tutorial: Setting Up the Floating Bottom Bar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `floating_bottom_bar` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `floating_bottom_bar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  floating_bottom_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Now that the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the floating bottom bar.

# Complete Example of Floating Bottom Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:floating_bottom_bar/floating_bottom_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Floating Bottom Bar Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Current index of the selected tab
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  // List of widgets to display for each tab
  final List<Widget> _children = [
    Center(child: Text('Home')),
    Center(child: Text('Search')),
    Center(child: Text('Profile')),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Floating Bottom Bar Example'),
      ),
      body: _children[_currentIndex], // Display the selected tab's content
      floatingActionButton: FloatingBottomBar(
        // Define the items in the floating bottom bar
        items: [
          FloatingBottomBarItem(
            icon: Icons.home,
            label: 'Home',
          ),
          FloatingBottomBarItem(
            icon: Icons.search,
            label: 'Search',
          ),
          FloatingBottomBarItem(
            icon: Icons.person,
            label: 'Profile',
          ),
        ],
        currentIndex: _currentIndex, // Set the current index
        onTap: (index) {
          // Update the current index when a tab is tapped
          setState(() {
            _currentIndex = index;
          });
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The HomeScreen is the main screen of the app, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. The _HomeScreenState maintains the current index of the selected tab and the content to display.
// 5. The Scaffold widget contains an AppBar and a body that displays the content based on the selected tab.
// 6. The FloatingBottomBar widget is used to create the floating bottom navigation bar.
// 7. The items in the bottom bar are defined, and the current index is set.
// 8. When a tab is tapped, the onTap callback updates the current index, triggering a rebuild to display the corresponding content.
