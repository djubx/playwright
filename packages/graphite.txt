# Graphite Flutter Package

The **Graphite** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create visually appealing and interactive graphs and charts. It provides a simple and efficient way to visualize data, making it an excellent choice for applications that require data representation, such as dashboards, analytics tools, and reporting applications.

## When to Use Graphite

You should consider using the Graphite package when:
- You need to display complex data in a user-friendly format.
- Your application requires real-time data visualization.
- You want to create interactive charts that allow users to explore data.

## Features

- **Multiple Chart Types**: Supports various chart types, including line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and more.
- **Customizable**: Offers extensive customization options for colors, labels, and styles to match your app's theme.
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adjusts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Animations**: Provides smooth animations for transitions and updates, enhancing user experience.
- **Interactivity**: Allows users to interact with the charts, such as tapping on data points for more information.

With these features, Graphite is a versatile package that can cater to a wide range of data visualization needs in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Graphite

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Graphite package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the Graphite package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  graphite: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the Graphite package:

```dart
import 'package:graphite/graphite.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Graphite in Your Application

You can now use Graphite to create charts. Below is a simple example of how to create a line chart.

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Graphite Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: LineChart(
          data: [
            DataPoint(x: 1, y: 2),
            DataPoint(x: 2, y: 3),
            DataPoint(x: 3, y: 5),
            DataPoint(x: 4, y: 4),
          ],
          title: 'Sample Line Chart',
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple line chart with sample data points. You can customize the chart further by adjusting properties such as colors, labels, and animations.

# Complete Example of Graphite in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:graphite/graphite.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Graphite Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Graphite Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: LineChart(
            data: [
              DataPoint(x: 1, y: 2), // Data point at x=1, y=2
              DataPoint(x: 2, y: 3), // Data point at x=2, y=3
              DataPoint(x: 3, y: 5), // Data point at x=3, y=5
              DataPoint(x: 4, y: 4), // Data point at x=4, y=4
            ],
            title: 'Sample Line Chart', // Title of the chart
            xAxisLabel: 'X Axis', // Label for the X-axis
            yAxisLabel: 'Y Axis', // Label for the Y-axis
            lineColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the line
            pointColor: Colors.red, // Color of the data points
            animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Animation duration
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to a Scaffold widget.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Graphite Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a LineChart widget.
// 6. The LineChart is populated with data points, axis labels, and styling options.
// 7. The chart is displayed in the center of the screen, showcasing the data visually.
```
