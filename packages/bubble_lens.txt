# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Bubble Lens

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **bubble_lens** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bubble_lens: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires them. However, the **bubble_lens** package does not require any specific permissions by default.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the bubble lens effect.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bubble_lens/bubble_lens.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Bubble Lens Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: BubbleLens(
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
            ),
            bubbleColor: Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.5),
            bubbleSize: 100.0,
            duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that has a bubble effect when interacted with.

# Complete Example of Bubble Lens in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bubble_lens/bubble_lens.dart';

// Main class of the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Bubble Lens Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using BubbleLens widget to wrap the button
          child: BubbleLens(
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                print('Button Pressed!');
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
            ),
            // Customizing the bubble effect
            bubbleColor: Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.5), // Color of the bubble
            bubbleSize: 100.0, // Size of the bubble
            duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Duration of the bubble effect
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, we use the BubbleLens widget to wrap an ElevatedButton.
4. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback, which currently prints 'Button Pressed!' to the console.
5. The BubbleLens widget adds a bubble effect around the button, with customizable properties like bubbleColor, bubbleSize, and duration.
6. The bubble effect enhances the user experience by visually indicating interaction with the button.
