# Setting Up Flutter Mentions
=============================

To use the `flutter_mentions` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the `flutter_mentions` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_mentions: ^1.1.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the `flutter_mentions` package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_mentions/flutter_mentions.dart';
```

### Step 3: Create a MentionsController

Create a `MentionsController` instance to handle mention functionality:

```dart
final mentionsController = MentionsController();
```

### Step 4: Create a TextField with Mentions

Create a `TextField` with mentions using the `MentionsTextField` widget:

```dart
MentionsTextField(
  mentionsController: mentionsController,
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    border: OutlineInputBorder(),
    labelText: 'Type a message',
  ),
)
```

### Step 5: Handle Mention Taps

Handle mention taps by listening to the `onMentionTap` callback:

```dart
MentionsTextField(
  mentionsController: mentionsController,
  onMentionTap: (mention) {
    // Handle mention tap here
  },
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

The `flutter_mentions` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to adjust the `MentionsTextField` widget's properties to fit your app's design.

### Configurations and Optimizations

You can customize the mention styles and colors by using the `mentionStyle` and `mentionColor` properties:

```dart
MentionsTextField(
  mentionsController: mentionsController,
  mentionStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 14, color: Colors.blue),
)
```

You can also optimize the mention functionality by using the `debounceDuration` property to delay the mention search:

```dart
MentionsTextField(
  mentionsController: mentionsController,
  debounceDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
)
```

                print('Mention tapped: ${mention.displayName}');
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 16),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Get the mention text
                final mentionText = mentionsController.text;
                print('Mention text: $mentionText');
              },
              child: Text('Get Mention Text'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user types a message in the text field.
// 2. The user mentions another user by typing the "@" symbol followed by the user's name.
// 3. The mention is displayed in the text field with a blue color.
// 4. When the user taps on the mention, the onMentionTap callback is called.
// 5. The onMentionTap callback prints the mention's display name to the console.
// 6. When the user clicks the "Get Mention Text" button, the mention text is printed to the console.

// The mention functionality is handled by the MentionsController instance.
// The MentionsController instance is used to get the mention text and to handle mention taps.

// The MentionsTextField widget is used to display the text field with mention functionality.
// The MentionsTextField widget takes a MentionsController instance as a parameter.
// The MentionsTextField widget also takes a decoration parameter to customize the text field's appearance.
// The MentionsTextField widget also takes an onMentionTap callback to handle mention taps.
