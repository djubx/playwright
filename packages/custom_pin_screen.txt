# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Custom Pin Screen

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `custom_pin_screen` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `custom_pin_screen` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  custom_pin_screen: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:custom_pin_screen/custom_pin_screen.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Typically, no special permissions are required for this package, but ensure your app's minimum SDK version is compatible.

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your app's `Info.plist` file to handle any specific requirements, such as enabling secure storage if you plan to save the PIN securely.

## Step 4: Using the Custom Pin Screen
You can now use the `CustomPinScreen` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_pin_screen/custom_pin_screen.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: CustomPinScreen(
        pinLength: 4, // Set the desired PIN length
        onPinEntered: (String pin) {
          // Handle the PIN entered by the user
          if (pin == "1234") {
            // Navigate to the next screen if the PIN is correct
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => HomeScreen()),
            );
          } else {
            // Show an error message if the PIN is incorrect
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Incorrect PIN, please try again.')),
            );
          }
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple PIN entry screen that checks if the entered PIN is "1234". If the PIN is correct, the user is navigated to the `HomeScreen`. If incorrect, an error message is displayed.

# Complete Example of Custom Pin Screen

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_pin_screen/custom_pin_screen.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: CustomPinScreen(
        pinLength: 4, // Set the desired PIN length
        onPinEntered: (String pin) {
          // Handle the PIN entered by the user
          if (pin == "1234") {
            // Navigate to the next screen if the PIN is correct
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => HomeScreen()),
            );
          } else {
            // Show an error message if the PIN is incorrect
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Incorrect PIN, please try again.')),
            );
          }
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!')),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is the main entry point.
// 2. The CustomPinScreen widget is displayed, prompting the user to enter a PIN.
// 3. The user enters a 4-digit PIN.
// 4. The onPinEntered callback is triggered with the entered PIN as an argument.
// 5. If the entered PIN matches "1234", the user is navigated to the HomeScreen.
// 6. If the entered PIN is incorrect, a SnackBar message is shown to inform the user.
// 7. The HomeScreen displays a welcome message once the user successfully enters the correct PIN.
```

In summary, the `custom_pin_screen` package provides a straightforward way to implement a secure PIN entry system in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, developers can easily integrate this functionality into their apps, enhancing user security and experience.
