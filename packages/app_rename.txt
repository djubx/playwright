# Complete Example of Using app_rename

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_rename/app_rename.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the app with the main widget
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Real Flutter App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Real Flutter App'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Trigger the app renaming process
            renameApp();
          },
          child: Text('Rename App'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void renameApp() {
    // Call the app_rename package to rename the app
    AppRename.rename(
      appName: 'New App Name',
      packageName: 'com.example.newapp',
    ).then((result) {
      // Show a success message after renaming
      if (result) {
        print('App renamed successfully!');
      } else {
        print('Failed to rename the app.');
      }
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is set as the home of the app, displaying a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the renameApp function is called.
// 5. The renameApp function uses the app_rename package to rename the app with the specified name and package.
// 6. A success or failure message is printed based on the result of the renaming process.
