# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Unique Simple Bar Chart

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **unique_simple_bar_chart** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  unique_simple_bar_chart: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the bar chart, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:unique_simple_bar_chart/unique_simple_bar_chart.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Bar Chart

You can now use the `RealFlutter` class to create a bar chart. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
RealFlutter(
  data: [
    BarData(label: 'January', value: 30),
    BarData(label: 'February', value: 50),
    BarData(label: 'March', value: 20),
  ],
  barColor: Colors.blue,
  animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 1),
);
```

This code snippet creates a bar chart with three bars representing data for January, February, and March.

# Complete Example of Unique Simple Bar Chart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:unique_simple_bar_chart/unique_simple_bar_chart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Unique Simple Bar Chart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bar Chart Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: BarChartWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class BarChartWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return RealFlutter(
      // Providing the data for the bar chart
      data: [
        BarData(label: 'January', value: 30), // Data for January
        BarData(label: 'February', value: 50), // Data for February
        BarData(label: 'March', value: 20), // Data for March
      ],
      barColor: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the bars
      animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Animation duration for rendering
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Bar Chart Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers the BarChartWidget.
// 5. BarChartWidget builds the RealFlutter bar chart with specified data.
// 6. Each BarData instance represents a bar in the chart with a label and value.
// 7. The bar color is set to blue, and the chart animates over one second when rendered.
