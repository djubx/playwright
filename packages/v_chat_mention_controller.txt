# Tutorial: Setting Up v_chat_mention_controller

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `v_chat_mention_controller` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `v_chat_mention_controller` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  v_chat_mention_controller: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/v_chat_mention_controller).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions if your app requires internet access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:v_chat_mention_controller/v_chat_mention_controller.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

To use the `v_chat_mention_controller`, you need to create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and set up the mention controller. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Chat App')),
        body: MentionInput(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, `MentionInput` is a widget that will handle user input and mention functionality.

## Step 5: Customization

You can customize the mention input field by passing parameters to the `MentionInput` widget. For example, you can set the list of users to mention and customize the appearance.

```dart
MentionInput(
  users: userList, // List of users to mention
  onMentionSelected: (user) {
    // Handle mention selection
  },
);
```

This setup allows you to create a fully functional chat application with mention capabilities.

# Complete Example of v_chat_mention_controller

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:v_chat_mention_controller/v_chat_mention_controller.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Chat App with Mentions',
      home: ChatScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ChatScreenState createState() => _ChatScreenState();
}

class _ChatScreenState extends State<ChatScreen> {
  // List of users to mention
  final List<String> users = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Chat')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(child: Container()), // Placeholder for chat messages
          MentionInput(
            users: users, // Pass the list of users
            onMentionSelected: (user) {
              // Handle the mention selection
              print('Mentioned user: $user');
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and directs to ChatScreen.
// 3. ChatScreen displays the app bar and a mention input field.
// 4. The mention input field allows users to mention others from the provided list.
// 5. When a user is mentioned, the onMentionSelected callback is triggered, printing the mentioned user's name.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this complete example, we have created a simple chat application that utilizes the `v_chat_mention_controller` package. The application flow is straightforward:

1. The `main` function initializes the `RealFlutter` app.
2. The `RealFlutter` widget sets up the `MaterialApp` and directs to the `ChatScreen`.
3. The `ChatScreen` displays an app bar and a mention input field.
4. Users can mention others from the provided list, and when a user is mentioned, the `onMentionSelected` callback is triggered, printing the mentioned user's name.

This example demonstrates how to integrate the `v_chat_mention_controller` package into a Flutter application, providing a solid foundation for building more complex chat functionalities.
