# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Country IP Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `country_ip` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  country_ip: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:country_ip/country_ip.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the `CountryIp` class to fetch the country information. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void getCountryInfo() async {
  try {
    // Fetch the country information based on the user's IP
    final countryInfo = await CountryIp.getCountryInfo();
    print('Country: ${countryInfo.country}');
    print('Country Code: ${countryInfo.countryCode}');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error fetching country info: $e');
  }
}
```

This function retrieves the country information and prints it to the console. You can call this function in your app's main logic to utilize the country data effectively.

# Complete Example of Using the Country IP Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_ip/country_ip.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Country IP Example',
      home: CountryInfoScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CountryInfoScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountryInfoScreenState createState() => _CountryInfoScreenState();
}

class _CountryInfoScreenState extends State<CountryInfoScreen> {
  String _country = 'Fetching...'; // Initial state for country
  String _countryCode = ''; // Initial state for country code

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchCountryInfo(); // Fetch country info when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to fetch country information
  void _fetchCountryInfo() async {
    try {
      // Fetch the country information based on the user's IP
      final countryInfo = await CountryIp.getCountryInfo();
      setState(() {
        _country = countryInfo.country; // Update the country state
        _countryCode = countryInfo.countryCode; // Update the country code state
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _country = 'Error fetching country info'; // Handle error
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Country IP Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Country: $_country'), // Display the country
            Text('Country Code: $_countryCode'), // Display the country code
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and its home screen.
// 3. The CountryInfoScreen is a StatefulWidget that fetches country information when initialized.
// 4. In the initState method, _fetchCountryInfo is called to retrieve the user's country data.
// 5. The _fetchCountryInfo method uses the CountryIp package to get the country information.
// 6. The fetched data is then displayed on the screen, updating the UI with the country name and code.
// 7. If an error occurs during the fetch, an error message is displayed instead.
```
