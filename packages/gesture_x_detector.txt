# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Gesture X Detector

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `gesture_x_detector` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `gesture_x_detector` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gesture_x_detector: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/gesture_x_detector).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable gesture recognition in your `Info.plist` file. Add the following key-value pair:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
    <string>location</string>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement gesture detection.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gesture_x_detector/gesture_x_detector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: GestureDetectorExample(),
    );
  }
}

class GestureDetectorExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Gesture X Detector Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: GestureXDetector(
          onSwipe: (direction) {
            // Handle swipe gestures
            if (direction == SwipeDirection.left) {
              print('Swiped Left');
            } else if (direction == SwipeDirection.right) {
              print('Swiped Right');
            }
          },
          child: Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 200,
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: Center(child: Text('Swipe Me!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that detects swipe gestures on a blue container. The `GestureXDetector` widget wraps the container and listens for swipe gestures, printing the direction of the swipe to the console.

# Complete Example of Gesture X Detector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gesture_x_detector/gesture_x_detector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: GestureDetectorExample(),
    );
  }
}

class GestureDetectorExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Gesture X Detector Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: GestureXDetector(
          onSwipe: (direction) {
            // Handle swipe gestures
            if (direction == SwipeDirection.left) {
              print('Swiped Left'); // Action for left swipe
            } else if (direction == SwipeDirection.right) {
              print('Swiped Right'); // Action for right swipe
            } else if (direction == SwipeDirection.up) {
              print('Swiped Up'); // Action for up swipe
            } else if (direction == SwipeDirection.down) {
              print('Swiped Down'); // Action for down swipe
            }
          },
          child: Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 200,
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: Center(child: Text('Swipe Me!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a home set to GestureDetectorExample.
// 3. GestureDetectorExample creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a GestureXDetector is used to detect swipe gestures.
// 5. The onSwipe callback handles different swipe directions and prints the corresponding action to the console.
// 6. A blue container is displayed in the center, prompting the user to swipe.
// 7. When the user swipes in any direction, the corresponding message is printed to the console.
