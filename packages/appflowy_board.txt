# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Appflowy Board Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **appflowy_board** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  appflowy_board: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/appflowy_board).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:appflowy_board/appflowy_board.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

You can now use the **appflowy_board** in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to set up a basic board.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appflowy_board/appflowy_board.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Appflowy Board Example',
      home: BoardExample(),
    );
  }
}

class BoardExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Appflowy Board')),
      body: AppflowyBoard(
        // Define your board items and their properties here
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with an Appflowy board. You can customize the board by adding items and configuring their properties.

# Complete Example of Appflowy Board

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appflowy_board/appflowy_board.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Appflowy Board Example',
      home: BoardExample(),
    );
  }
}

class BoardExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BoardExampleState createState() => _BoardExampleState();
}

class _BoardExampleState extends State<BoardExample> {
  // Define the initial state of the board
  List<BoardItem> items = [
    BoardItem(title: 'Task 1', description: 'Description for Task 1'),
    BoardItem(title: 'Task 2', description: 'Description for Task 2'),
    BoardItem(title: 'Task 3', description: 'Description for Task 3'),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Appflowy Board')),
      body: AppflowyBoard(
        items: items,
        onItemMoved: (oldIndex, newIndex) {
          // Update the state when an item is moved
          setState(() {
            final item = items.removeAt(oldIndex);
            items.insert(newIndex, item);
          });
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code sets up a simple board with three tasks.
// The `BoardExample` class manages the state of the board.
// The `items` list holds the tasks, and the `onItemMoved` callback updates the list when a task is dragged and dropped.
// The `AppflowyBoard` widget displays the tasks and allows for drag-and-drop functionality.
```

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget sets up the MaterialApp and points to the `BoardExample` as the home screen.
// The `BoardExample` widget is a stateful widget that maintains a list of `BoardItem` objects.
// The `AppflowyBoard` widget is used to display the items, and it provides a callback to handle item movements.
// When an item is moved, the `onItemMoved` callback is triggered, updating the state of the `items` list accordingly.
// This allows users to drag and drop tasks, making the board interactive and dynamic.
