# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Icon Forest

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **icon_forest** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  icon_forest: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using it:

```dart
import 'package:icon_forest/icon_forest.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Icons in Your Application

You can now use the icons provided by the **icon_forest** package in your Flutter widgets. Here’s a simple example of how to use an icon:

```dart
IconForest.icon(
  Icons.home, // Replace with the desired icon
  size: 50.0,
  color: Colors.blue,
);
```

This will render a home icon with a size of 50 pixels and a blue color.

## Step 5: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons further by adjusting their size, color, and style. Here’s an example:

```dart
IconForest.icon(
  Icons.settings,
  size: 40.0,
  color: Colors.green,
  style: IconStyle.filled, // Example of a style option
);
```

This customization allows you to create a unique look for your application.

With these steps, you are now ready to integrate the **icon_forest** package into your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using Icon Forest

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:icon_forest/icon_forest.dart'; // Importing the icon_forest package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Icon Forest Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(), // Setting the home page
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Icon Forest Demo'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a home icon
            IconForest.icon(
              Icons.home,
              size: 100.0,
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a settings icon
            IconForest.icon(
              Icons.settings,
              size: 100.0,
              color: Colors.green,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a favorite icon
            IconForest.icon(
              Icons.favorite,
              size: 100.0,
              color: Colors.red,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. The HomePage widget builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 6. Each icon is created using IconForest.icon() with specified size and color.
// 7. The app displays three icons: home, settings, and favorite, each with a different color and size.
```
