# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `package_rename_plus`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `package_rename_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  package_rename_plus: ^2.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Setting Up the Package

### Android Configuration

1. **Update `android/app/build.gradle`**: Ensure that the `applicationId` matches your new package name.
2. **Update `AndroidManifest.xml`**: Change the package name in the manifest file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`**: Change the `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` to your new package name.
2. **Update `Info.plist`**: Ensure that the `CFBundleIdentifier` matches your new package name.

## Step 3: Using the Package

To rename your package, you can use the following code snippet in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:package_rename_plus/package_rename_plus.dart';

void main() async {
  // Initialize the package renaming process
  await PackageRenamePlus.rename(
    newPackageName: 'com.example.newname', // New package name
    newAppName: 'New App Name', // New app name
  );
}
```

### Running the Renaming Process

# Complete Example of Using `package_rename_plus`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:package_rename_plus/package_rename_plus.dart';

void main() async {
  // Start the renaming process
  await PackageRenamePlus.rename(
    newPackageName: 'com.example.newname', // Specify the new package name
    newAppName: 'New App Name', // Specify the new app name
  );

  // Run the Flutter application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'New App Name', // Set the title of the app
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue, // Define the primary color theme
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Welcome to New App Name'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Hello, this is your new app!', // Main content of the app
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Text style
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The `PackageRenamePlus.rename` method is called to rename the package and app name.
// 3. After renaming, the `runApp` function is called to start the Flutter application.
// 4. The `RealFlutter` class is defined as a StatelessWidget, which builds the UI.
// 5. The MaterialApp widget is created with a title and theme.
// 6. A Scaffold widget is used to provide a structure for the app, including an AppBar and body.
// 7. The body contains a Center widget that displays a greeting message.
