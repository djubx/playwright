# Media Cache Manager Flutter Package

The `media_cache_manager` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to efficiently manage media files in their applications. This package provides a simple and effective way to cache media files, such as images and videos, ensuring that they are readily available for use without the need for repeated downloads. 

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `media_cache_manager` package in scenarios such as:

- **Offline Access**: When your application needs to display media files even when the user is offline.
- **Performance Optimization**: To reduce loading times and improve the user experience by caching media files.
- **Data Usage Management**: To minimize data consumption by avoiding repeated downloads of the same media files.

## Features

- **Automatic Caching**: Automatically caches media files upon download.
- **File Management**: Provides methods to manage cached files, including clearing and retrieving them.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of cache settings, such as cache size and expiration.

By leveraging the `media_cache_manager`, developers can enhance their applications' performance and user experience significantly.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Media Cache Manager

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `media_cache_manager` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `media_cache_manager` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  media_cache_manager: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires permission to save photos to your library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to download and cache an image using the `media_cache_manager`.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:media_cache_manager/media_cache_manager.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of `RealFlutter` (the main class we will use) and implement the caching logic.

# Complete Example: Media Cache Manager in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:media_cache_manager/media_cache_manager.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Media Cache Manager Example',
      home: MediaCacheExample(),
    );
  }
}

class MediaCacheExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MediaCacheExampleState createState() => _MediaCacheExampleState();
}

class _MediaCacheExampleState extends State<MediaCacheExample> {
  String imageUrl = 'https://example.com/image.jpg'; // URL of the image to cache
  String cachedImagePath; // Variable to hold the path of the cached image

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _cacheImage(); // Start caching the image when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to cache the image
  Future<void> _cacheImage() async {
    // Use the MediaCacheManager to download and cache the image
    cachedImagePath = await MediaCacheManager().getFile(imageUrl);
    setState(() {}); // Update the state to reflect the cached image
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Media Cache Manager Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: cachedImagePath != null
            ? Image.file(File(cachedImagePath)) // Display the cached image
            : CircularProgressIndicator(), // Show a loading indicator while caching
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (MediaCacheExample).
// 3. MediaCacheExample is a stateful widget that manages the caching of an image.
// 4. In the initState method, the _cacheImage function is called to start caching the image.
// 5. The _cacheImage function uses MediaCacheManager to download and cache the image from the provided URL.
// 6. Once the image is cached, the state is updated, and the cached image is displayed in the UI.
// 7. If the image is still being cached, a CircularProgressIndicator is shown to indicate loading.
```
