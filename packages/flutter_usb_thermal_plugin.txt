# Setting Up and Using the Flutter USB Thermal Plugin

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_usb_thermal_plugin`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_usb_thermal_plugin: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_usb_thermal_plugin).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

2. **USB Access**: Ensure that your app can access USB devices by adding the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<application>
    <meta-data
        android:name="android.hardware.usb.host"
        android:value="true" />
</application>
```

### iOS
1. **Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for USB access:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need Bluetooth access to connect to the printer.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need Bluetooth access to connect to the printer.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `flutter_usb_thermal_plugin` in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the Package**:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_usb_thermal_plugin/flutter_usb_thermal_plugin.dart';
```

2. **Initialize the Printer**:

```dart
final printer = RealFlutter();
```

3. **Connect to the Printer**:

```dart
await printer.connect();
```

4. **Print a Sample Receipt**:

```dart
await printer.printCustom("Hello, World!", 2, 1);
```

This basic setup will allow you to connect to a USB thermal printer and print a simple message. For more advanced features, refer to the package documentation.

# Complete Example of Using the Flutter USB Thermal Plugin

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_usb_thermal_plugin/flutter_usb_thermal_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'USB Thermal Printer Example',
      home: PrinterPage(),
    );
  }
}

class PrinterPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PrinterPageState createState() => _PrinterPageState();
}

class _PrinterPageState extends State<PrinterPage> {
  final printer = RealFlutter(); // Initialize the printer instance

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Attempt to connect to the printer when the widget is initialized
    connectToPrinter();
  }

  Future<void> connectToPrinter() async {
    try {
      await printer.connect(); // Connect to the printer
      print("Connected to printer");
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error connecting to printer: $e");
    }
  }

  Future<void> printReceipt() async {
    try {
      await printer.printCustom("Receipt Title", 2, 1); // Print title
      await printer.printNewLine(); // Add a new line
      await printer.printCustom("Item 1: \$10.00", 1, 0); // Print item
      await printer.printCustom("Item 2: \$15.00", 1, 0); // Print item
      await printer.printNewLine(); // Add a new line
      await printer.printCustom("Total: \$25.00", 2, 1); // Print total
      await printer.printNewLine(); // Add a new line
      await printer.printCustom("Thank you for your purchase!", 1, 1); // Print thank you message
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error printing receipt: $e");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('USB Thermal Printer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: printReceipt, // Call printReceipt when button is pressed
          child: Text('Print Receipt'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts by initializing the `MyApp` widget, which sets up the main structure of the app.
// The `PrinterPage` widget is created, where the `RealFlutter` printer instance is initialized.
// In the `initState` method, the app attempts to connect to the printer.
// If the connection is successful, a message is printed to the console.
// The `printReceipt` method is defined to handle the printing of a sample receipt.
// When the user presses the "Print Receipt" button, the app calls the `printReceipt` method,
// which sends print commands to the connected USB thermal printer, formatting the receipt with items and totals.
// The app provides a simple user interface with a button to trigger the printing process.
