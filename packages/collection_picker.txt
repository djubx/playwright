# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `collection_picker`

## Installation

To get started with the `collection_picker` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  collection_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/collection_picker).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` to include any necessary permissions, especially if your app requires access to device features.

## Using the Package

To use the `collection_picker`, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:collection_picker/collection_picker.dart';
   ```

2. Create a list of items that you want to display in the picker.

3. Use the `CollectionPicker` widget in your UI, passing the list of items and handling the selected values.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it in your Flutter app.

# Complete Example of `collection_picker`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:collection_picker/collection_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Collection Picker Example',
      home: CollectionPickerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class CollectionPickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CollectionPickerDemoState createState() => _CollectionPickerDemoState();
}

class _CollectionPickerDemoState extends State<CollectionPickerDemo> {
  // List of items to select from
  final List<String> items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Elderberry'];
  
  // Variable to hold selected items
  List<String> selectedItems = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Collection Picker Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display selected items
            Text('Selected Items: ${selectedItems.join(', ')}'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open the collection picker
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Open the collection picker and await the result
                final result = await showDialog<List<String>>(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) {
                    return CollectionPicker<String>(
                      items: items,
                      title: Text('Select Fruits'),
                      onConfirm: (selected) {
                        Navigator.of(context).pop(selected); // Return selected items
                      },
                    );
                  },
                );

                // Update the state with selected items
                if (result != null) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedItems = result;
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick Fruits'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the `collection_picker` package.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app and sets `RealFlutter` as the root widget.
// 2. `RealFlutter` is a stateless widget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. `CollectionPickerDemo` is a stateful widget that manages the state of selected items.
// 4. A list of items (fruits) is defined for selection.
// 5. The UI displays the selected items and includes a button to open the collection picker.
// 6. When the button is pressed, a dialog opens with the collection picker, allowing users to select multiple items.
// 7. Upon confirmation, the selected items are returned and displayed in the UI.
