# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Device Preview Screenshot

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `device_preview_screenshot` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  device_preview_screenshot: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/device_preview_screenshot).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request permission for saving images:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save screenshots.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the screenshot functionality.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:device_preview_screenshot/device_preview_screenshot.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Device Preview Screenshot Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Capture the screenshot
              final image = await DevicePreviewScreenshot.takeScreenshot();
              // Save or use the screenshot as needed
            },
            child: Text('Take Screenshot'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that, when pressed, captures a screenshot of the current screen.

# Complete Example of Device Preview Screenshot

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:device_preview_screenshot/device_preview_screenshot.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Device Preview Screenshot Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Capture the screenshot
              final image = await DevicePreviewScreenshot.takeScreenshot();
              // Save or use the screenshot as needed
            },
            child: Text('Take Screenshot'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. Inside the callback, the takeScreenshot method from the device_preview_screenshot package is called.
// 6. This method captures the current screen and returns an image.
// 7. You can then save or use the captured image as needed, such as saving it to the device or uploading it to a server.
```
