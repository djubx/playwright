# Setting Up and Using markdown_quill

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `markdown_quill` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  markdown_quill: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/markdown_quill).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, especially if you plan to use features like image uploads. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a rich text editor using `markdown_quill`.

# Complete Example of markdown_quill in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:markdown_quill/markdown_quill.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Markdown Quill Example',
      home: MarkdownEditor(),
    );
  }
}

class MarkdownEditor extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MarkdownEditorState createState() => _MarkdownEditorState();
}

class _MarkdownEditorState extends State<MarkdownEditor> {
  // Controller for the Markdown editor
  final QuillController _controller = QuillController.basic();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Markdown Quill Editor'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Markdown editor widget
          Expanded(
            child: QuillEditor(
              controller: _controller,
              readOnly: false, // Set to true to make it read-only
              autoFocus: true,
              expands: true,
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(10),
            ),
          ),
          // Toolbar for formatting options
          QuillToolbar.basic(controller: _controller),
          // Button to display the formatted Markdown
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Display the formatted Markdown text
              final markdownText = _controller.document.toPlainText();
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Formatted Markdown'),
                  content: SingleChildScrollView(
                    child: Text(markdownText),
                  ),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                      child: Text('Close'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Formatted Markdown'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as MarkdownEditor.
// 3. In MarkdownEditor, a QuillController is created to manage the state of the editor.
// 4. The build method constructs the UI, including the QuillEditor and QuillToolbar.
// 5. The user can input and format text using the toolbar.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the formatted Markdown text is extracted and displayed in a dialog.
```

### Summary of the Code Flow
- The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget.
- The `RealFlutter` widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with `MarkdownEditor` as the home screen.
- Inside `MarkdownEditor`, a `QuillController` is instantiated to manage the editor's state.
- The UI consists of a `QuillEditor` for text input and a `QuillToolbar` for formatting options.
- When the user clicks the "Show Formatted Markdown" button, the current text is extracted from the editor and displayed in a dialog.
