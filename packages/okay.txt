### Setup Process

To get started with the "okay" package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the "okay" package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     okay: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if you are using features that require them (e.g., internet access).
   - **iOS**: For iOS, make sure to configure your app's Info.plist if you are using any specific features that require permissions.

### Using the Package

To use the "okay" package in your Flutter application, you need to import it into your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:okay/okay.dart';
```

You can then utilize the package's features to display alerts and messages. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to show an informational alert:

```dart
Okay.showInfo(context, title: "Info", message: "This is an informational message.");
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:okay/okay.dart'; // Importing the okay package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Running the main application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Okay Package Example',
      home: HomePage(), // Setting the home page of the app
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Okay Package Demo'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // When the button is pressed, show an informational alert
            Okay.showInfo(
              context,
              title: "Hello!",
              message: "You pressed the button!", // Message to display
            );
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. HomePage is a StatelessWidget that contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the Okay.showInfo method is called, displaying an alert with a title and message.
// 6. The alert provides feedback to the user, confirming that their action (button press) was recognized.
```
