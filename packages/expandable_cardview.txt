# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Expandable CardView

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `expandable_cardview` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  expandable_cardview: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:expandable_cardview/expandable_cardview.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Expandable CardView

You can now use the `ExpandableCardView` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ExpandableCardView(
  header: Text("Header"),
  body: Text("This is the expandable content."),
)
```

This will create a card with a header that, when tapped, expands to show the body content.

With these steps, you are now ready to implement the `expandable_cardview` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Expandable CardView

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:expandable_cardview/expandable_cardview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Expandable CardView Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Expandable CardView Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Creating an expandable card view
              ExpandableCardView(
                header: Container(
                  padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                  color: Colors.blue,
                  child: Text(
                    'Tap to Expand',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                  ),
                ),
                body: Container(
                  padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                  color: Colors.lightBlueAccent,
                  child: Text(
                    'This is the expanded content of the card. Here you can add more details or information.',
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Expandable CardView Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, we create an ExpandableCardView widget.
// 6. The header of the card is a Container with padding and a blue background, displaying 'Tap to Expand'.
// 7. The body of the card is another Container with padding and a light blue background, showing the expanded content.
// 8. When the header is tapped, the card expands to reveal the body content, providing an interactive experience.
