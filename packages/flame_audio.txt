# Tutorial: Setting Up Flame Audio

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **flame_audio** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **flame_audio** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flame_audio: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_audio).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions to allow audio playback:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio features.</string>
<key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your music library for audio features.</string>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the **flame_audio** package:

```dart
import 'package:flame_audio/flame_audio.dart';
```

## Step 4: Initialize Flame Audio

Before using the audio features, initialize the package in your main function:

```dart
void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  FlameAudio.audioCache.loadAll(['background.mp3', 'click.wav']);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Using Flame Audio

You can now use the package to play audio. Hereâ€™s how to play background music and sound effects:

```dart
// Play background music
FlameAudio.bgm.play('background.mp3');

// Play a sound effect
FlameAudio.audioCache.play('click.wav');
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up the **flame_audio** package in your Flutter application. You can now use it to enhance your app with audio features.

# Complete Example of Flame Audio

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flame_audio/flame_audio.dart';

void main() {
  // Ensure Flutter binding is initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Load audio files into cache
  FlameAudio.audioCache.loadAll(['background.mp3', 'click.wav']);
  
  // Run the Flutter app
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flame Audio Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flame Audio Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Press the button to play sound!'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Play sound effect when button is pressed
                  FlameAudio.audioCache.play('click.wav');
                },
                child: Text('Play Sound Effect'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Play background music
                  FlameAudio.bgm.play('background.mp3');
                },
                child: Text('Play Background Music'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and loads audio files into cache.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds the main UI with two buttons.
// 3. When the "Play Sound Effect" button is pressed, the click.wav sound effect is played.
// 4. When the "Play Background Music" button is pressed, the background.mp3 music starts playing.
// 5. The app provides audio feedback for user interactions, enhancing the overall experience.
