# Speedometer Flutter Package

The **Speedometer** Flutter package is a versatile and visually appealing widget designed to display speed in a gauge format. This package is particularly useful for applications that require real-time speed tracking, such as navigation apps, fitness trackers, or any application that involves speed measurement.

## When to Use This Package
- **Navigation Apps**: To show the current speed of a vehicle.
- **Fitness Applications**: To track the speed of running or cycling.
- **Games**: To display the speed of characters or vehicles in a game.

## Features
- **Customizable Design**: The speedometer can be styled to fit the theme of your application.
- **Real-time Updates**: Capable of updating the displayed speed in real-time.
- **Multiple Units**: Supports different units of speed (e.g., km/h, mph).
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions when the speed changes, enhancing user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Speedometer Package

## Installation
To use the Speedometer package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  speedometer: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable background modes if you plan to track speed in the background. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>location</string>
</array>
```

## Using the Speedometer
To use the Speedometer in your Flutter application, you can create a simple widget that updates the speed dynamically. Below is an example of how to implement it.

# Complete Example of Using the Speedometer Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:speedometer/speedometer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _currentSpeed = 0.0; // Variable to hold the current speed

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Simulate speed updates every second
    _simulateSpeedUpdates();
  }

  void _simulateSpeedUpdates() {
    // This function simulates speed updates for demonstration purposes
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () {
      setState(() {
        _currentSpeed = (_currentSpeed + 10) % 120; // Increment speed
      });
      _simulateSpeedUpdates(); // Call again for continuous updates
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Speedometer Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Speedometer(
            // Speedometer widget from the package
            maxValue: 120, // Maximum speed value
            currentValue: _currentSpeed, // Current speed value
            displayText: 'Speed', // Text displayed on the speedometer
            needleColor: Colors.red, // Color of the needle
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[200], // Background color of the speedometer
            // Additional customization options can be added here
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that displays a speedometer.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that maintains the current speed.
// 3. In the `initState` method, we start simulating speed updates every second.
// 4. The `_simulateSpeedUpdates` method updates the `_currentSpeed` variable and calls itself recursively to create a loop.
// 5. The `build` method constructs the UI, which includes a `Speedometer` widget.
// 6. The `Speedometer` widget takes parameters like `maxValue`, `currentValue`, and customization options for colors and text.
// 7. As the `_currentSpeed` updates, the speedometer reflects these changes in real-time.
