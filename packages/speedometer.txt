**Final Summary:**

The code flows as follows:

1.  The user opens the app and sees the speedometer with an initial value of 50.
2.  The user adjusts the slider to change the current value of the speedometer.
3.  The speedometer updates in real-time to reflect the new current value.
4.  The user can continue to adjust the slider to see the speedometer update smoothly.

The speedometer package provides a customizable and easy-to-use way to create speedometer-like gauges in Flutter applications. The example code demonstrates how to use the package to create a speedometer that updates smoothly in real-time.
