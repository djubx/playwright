# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_sound_record

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_sound_record` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_sound_record` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_sound_record: ^9.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. **Target SDK**: Ensure your `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` are set to at least 31 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    compileSdkVersion 31
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        targetSdkVersion 31
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to record audio.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save recordings.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple application that records audio.

1. **Import the Package**:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';
```

2. **Create the Main Application Class**:

In your main Dart file, create a class named `RealFlutter` that will handle audio recording.

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  FlutterSoundRecorder _recorder;
  bool _isRecording = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _recorder = FlutterSoundRecorder();
    _initRecorder();
  }

  Future<void> _initRecorder() async {
    await _recorder.openAudioSession();
  }

  Future<void> _startRecording() async {
    await _recorder.startRecorder(toFile: 'audio_record.aac');
    setState(() {
      _isRecording = true;
    });
  }

  Future<void> _stopRecording() async {
    await _recorder.stopRecorder();
    setState(() {
      _isRecording = false;
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _recorder.closeAudioSession();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Audio Recorder')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(_isRecording ? 'Recording...' : 'Press to Record'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _isRecording ? _stopRecording : _startRecording,
              child: Text(_isRecording ? 'Stop' : 'Start'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. **Run the Application**: Finally, run your application using `flutter run`.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp widget that sets up the MaterialApp
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Sound Record Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Home screen is the RealFlutter widget
    );
  }
}

// RealFlutter widget that handles audio recording
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  FlutterSoundRecorder _recorder; // Instance of FlutterSoundRecorder
  bool _isRecording = false; // State variable to track recording status

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _recorder = FlutterSoundRecorder(); // Initialize the recorder
    _initRecorder(); // Call the method to open the audio session
  }

  // Method to initialize the audio recorder
  Future<void> _initRecorder() async {
    await _recorder.openAudioSession(); // Open the audio session
  }

  // Method to start recording audio
  Future<void> _startRecording() async {
    await _recorder.startRecorder(toFile: 'audio_record.aac'); // Start recording to a file
    setState(() {
      _isRecording = true; // Update the recording state
    });
  }

  // Method to stop recording audio
  Future<void> _stopRecording() async {
    await _recorder.stopRecorder(); // Stop the recording
    setState(() {
      _isRecording = false; // Update the recording state
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _recorder.closeAudioSession(); // Close the audio session when done
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Audio Recorder')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(_isRecording ? 'Recording...' : 'Press to Record'), // Display recording status
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _isRecording ? _stopRecording : _startRecording, // Toggle recording
              child: Text(_isRecording ? 'Stop' : 'Start'), // Button text based on recording state
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up a MaterialApp with the RealFlutter widget as the home screen.
// 3. RealFlutter initializes the FlutterSoundRecorder and opens an audio session.
// 4. The user can start and stop recording by pressing the button, which toggles the recording state.
// 5. The recorded audio is saved as 'audio_record.aac' in the app's directory.
// 6. The app updates the UI to reflect whether it is currently recording or not.
```
