# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `settings_ui` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `settings_ui` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     settings_ui: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if your settings involve accessing device features (like location).
   - **iOS**: Update your `Info.plist` file to include any required permissions for accessing device features.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:settings_ui/settings_ui.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

Here’s a simple example of how to use the `settings_ui` package to create a settings page:

1. **Create a Settings Page**: Use the `SettingsList` widget to create a list of settings options.

   ```dart
   SettingsList(
     sections: [
       SettingsSection(
         title: 'General',
         tiles: [
           SettingsTile(
             title: 'Account',
             subtitle: 'Manage your account settings',
             leading: Icon(Icons.account_circle),
             onTap: () {
               // Navigate to account settings
             },
           ),
           SettingsTile.switchTile(
             title: 'Notifications',
             leading: Icon(Icons.notifications),
             switchValue: true,
             onToggle: (bool value) {
               // Handle toggle
             },
           ),
         ],
       ),
     ],
   );
   ```

2. **Customize Your Settings**: You can customize the appearance and behavior of each setting tile according to your app's requirements.

3. **Testing**: Run your application on both Android and iOS devices to ensure that the settings page displays correctly and functions as expected.

By following these steps, you can easily integrate the `settings_ui` package into your Flutter application and create a user-friendly settings page.

# Complete Example

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application using the `settings_ui` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:settings_ui/settings_ui.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Settings UI Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: SettingsPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SettingsPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Settings'),
      ),
      body: SettingsList(
        sections: [
          SettingsSection(
            title: 'General',
            tiles: [
              SettingsTile(
                title: 'Account',
                subtitle: 'Manage your account settings',
                leading: Icon(Icons.account_circle),
                onTap: () {
                  // Navigate to account settings
                  Navigator.push(
                    context,
                    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => AccountSettingsPage()),
                  );
                },
              ),
              SettingsTile.switchTile(
                title: 'Notifications',
                leading: Icon(Icons.notifications),
                switchValue: true,
                onToggle: (bool value) {
                  // Handle toggle
                  print('Notifications: $value');
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
          SettingsSection(
            title: 'About',
            tiles: [
              SettingsTile(
                title: 'Version',
                subtitle: '1.0.0',
                leading: Icon(Icons.info),
                onTap: () {
                  // Show version info
                  showDialog(
                    context: context,
                    builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('App Version'),
                      content: Text('Version 1.0.0'),
                      actions: [
                        TextButton(
                          onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                          child: Text('OK'),
                        ),
                      ],
                    ),
                  );
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

class AccountSettingsPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Account Settings'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Account settings go here.'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, setting SettingsPage as the home.
// 3. SettingsPage displays a settings list with sections for 'General' and 'About'.
// 4. Tapping on 'Account' navigates to AccountSettingsPage.
// 5. The 'Notifications' tile has a switch that prints the toggle state to the console.
// 6. The 'Version' tile shows a dialog with the app version when tapped.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple settings page using the `settings_ui` package. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the app, displays a settings list, and allows navigation to an account settings page. The settings tiles are interactive, providing a seamless user experience.
