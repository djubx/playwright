# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Adaptive Theme Fluent UI

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `adaptive_theme_fluent_ui` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Package to Your Project
To get started, you need to add the `adaptive_theme_fluent_ui` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  adaptive_theme_fluent_ui: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/adaptive_theme_fluent_ui).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### For Android
Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31
    ...
}
```

### For iOS
In your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`, you may want to add any necessary configurations for theming, although the package should work out of the box.

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement adaptive theming.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:adaptive_theme_fluent_ui/adaptive_theme_fluent_ui.dart';
```

2. Wrap your application with `AdaptiveTheme`:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(AdaptiveTheme(
    light: AdaptiveThemeData.light(),
    dark: AdaptiveThemeData.dark(),
    initial: AdaptiveThemeMode.light,
    child: MyApp(),
  ));
}
```

3. Use the `AdaptiveTheme` to switch themes based on user preferences.

This setup allows you to create a responsive and adaptive UI that changes according to the platform and user settings.

# Complete Example: Implementing Adaptive Theme Fluent UI

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adaptive_theme_fluent_ui/adaptive_theme_fluent_ui.dart';

void main() {
  // Run the app with AdaptiveTheme
  runApp(AdaptiveTheme(
    light: AdaptiveThemeData.light(), // Define light theme
    dark: AdaptiveThemeData.dark(), // Define dark theme
    initial: AdaptiveThemeMode.light, // Set initial theme mode
    child: RealFlutter(), // Main application widget
  ));
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current theme mode
    final theme = AdaptiveTheme.of(context);
    
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Adaptive Theme Example',
      theme: theme.light, // Use light theme
      darkTheme: theme.dark, // Use dark theme
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Adaptive Theme Fluent UI'),
          actions: [
            // Button to toggle between light and dark themes
            IconButton(
              icon: Icon(Icons.brightness_6),
              onPressed: () {
                // Toggle theme mode
                theme.toggle();
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Press the button to toggle theme!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app with AdaptiveTheme.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is the main application widget.
// 3. Inside the build method, we retrieve the current theme using AdaptiveTheme.of(context).
// 4. The MaterialApp is set up with light and dark themes.
// 5. An AppBar is created with a title and an action button to toggle the theme.
// 6. The body contains a centered text widget that prompts the user to toggle the theme.
// 7. When the button is pressed, the theme mode is toggled, switching between light and dark themes.
```
