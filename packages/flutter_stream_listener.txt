# Flutter Stream Listener Package

The `flutter_stream_listener` package is a powerful tool for managing streams in Flutter applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to listen to streams and react to changes in real-time. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to update the UI based on data changes, such as fetching data from a server, listening to user inputs, or responding to events in your application.

## When to Use `flutter_stream_listener`

You should consider using `flutter_stream_listener` in the following scenarios:

- **Real-time Data Updates**: When your application needs to display data that changes frequently, such as chat messages or live scores.
- **Event Handling**: To respond to user actions or system events, such as button clicks or network status changes.
- **State Management**: To manage the state of your application in a reactive way, allowing the UI to update automatically when the underlying data changes.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: The package can be easily integrated into any Flutter application with minimal setup.
- **Reactive Programming**: It leverages the power of streams to provide a reactive programming model, making it easier to manage state and UI updates.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the behavior of the stream listener to suit your application's needs.

Overall, `flutter_stream_listener` is an essential package for Flutter developers looking to implement reactive programming patterns in their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_stream_listener`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_stream_listener` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_stream_listener: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use `flutter_stream_listener` to listen to a stream of integers.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_stream_listener/flutter_stream_listener.dart';
```

2. Create a simple stream that emits integers:

```dart
Stream<int> numberStream() async* {
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
    yield i; // Emit the next number
  }
}
```

3. Use the `StreamListener` widget to listen to the stream:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stream Listener Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: StreamListener<int>(
            stream: numberStream(),
            onData: (data) {
              // Handle the incoming data
              print('Received: $data');
            },
            child: Text('Listening to stream...'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `StreamListener` widget listens to the `numberStream` and prints the received data to the console.

# Complete Example of `flutter_stream_listener`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_stream_listener/flutter_stream_listener.dart';

// This is the main entry point of the Flutter application.
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The main widget of the application.
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stream Listener Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using StreamListener to listen to a stream of integers.
          child: StreamListener<int>(
            stream: numberStream(), // The stream to listen to.
            onData: (data) {
              // This callback is called whenever new data is emitted by the stream.
              print('Received: $data'); // Print the received data to the console.
            },
            child: Text('Listening to stream...'), // Child widget displayed in the center.
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// A simple stream that emits integers every second.
Stream<int> numberStream() async* {
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1)); // Wait for 1 second.
    yield i; // Emit the next number in the sequence.
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a StreamListener is created to listen to the numberStream.
// 4. The numberStream emits integers from 0 to 9, one every second.
// 5. Each time a new integer is emitted, the onData callback is triggered, printing the received integer to the console.
// 6. The child widget displays a message indicating that the stream is being listened to.
