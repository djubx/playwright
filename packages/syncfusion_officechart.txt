# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Syncfusion OfficeChart

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `syncfusion_officechart` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `syncfusion_officechart` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  syncfusion_officechart: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/syncfusion_officechart).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Android

1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### For iOS

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions if you plan to use features that require them:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save charts.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for scanning.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:syncfusion_officechart/syncfusion_officechart.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `syncfusion_officechart` package to create charts. Below is a simple example of how to create a bar chart.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:syncfusion_officechart/syncfusion_officechart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Syncfusion OfficeChart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Syncfusion OfficeChart Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SfCartesianChart(
            title: ChartTitle(text: 'Sales Data'),
            legend: Legend(isVisible: true),
            primaryXAxis: CategoryAxis(),
            series: <ChartSeries>[
              ColumnSeries<SalesData, String>(
                dataSource: getChartData(),
                xValueMapper: (SalesData sales, _) => sales.year,
                yValueMapper: (SalesData sales, _) => sales.sales,
                name: 'Sales',
                dataLabelSettings: DataLabelSettings(isVisible: true),
              )
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Sample data for the chart
  List<SalesData> getChartData() {
    return [
      SalesData('2017', 35),
      SalesData('2018', 28),
      SalesData('2019', 34),
      SalesData('2020', 32),
      SalesData('2021', 40),
    ];
  }
}

// SalesData class to hold the data for the chart
class SalesData {
  SalesData(this.year, this.sales);
  final String year;
  final double sales;
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Syncfusion OfficeChart Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a SfCartesianChart widget.
// 5. The SfCartesianChart is configured with a title, legend, and primary X-axis.
// 6. A ColumnSeries is created to represent sales data, using the getChartData() method to provide the data source.
// 7. The getChartData() method returns a list of SalesData objects, each representing sales figures for a specific year.
// 8. The SalesData class is defined to hold the year and sales values, which are used to populate the chart.
```
