# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_data_table

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_data_table` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_data_table: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_data_table).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_data_table/flutter_data_table.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Data Table

You can now use the `DataTable` widget provided by the package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
DataTable(
  columns: [
    DataColumn(label: Text('Name')),
    DataColumn(label: Text('Age')),
    DataColumn(label: Text('Email')),
  ],
  rows: [
    DataRow(cells: [
      DataCell(Text('John Doe')),
      DataCell(Text('30')),
      DataCell(Text('john@example.com')),
    ]),
    DataRow(cells: [
      DataCell(Text('Jane Smith')),
      DataCell(Text('25')),
      DataCell(Text('jane@example.com')),
    ]),
  ],
)
```

This code snippet creates a simple data table with three columns: Name, Age, and Email, and two rows of data.

# Complete Example of flutter_data_table

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_data_table/flutter_data_table.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Data Table Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Data Table Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: DataTable(
            columns: [
              DataColumn(label: Text('Name')),
              DataColumn(label: Text('Age')),
              DataColumn(label: Text('Email')),
            ],
            rows: [
              DataRow(cells: [
                DataCell(Text('John Doe')),
                DataCell(Text('30')),
                DataCell(Text('john@example.com')),
              ]),
              DataRow(cells: [
                DataCell(Text('Jane Smith')),
                DataCell(Text('25')),
                DataCell(Text('jane@example.com')),
              ]),
              DataRow(cells: [
                DataCell(Text('Alice Johnson')),
                DataCell(Text('28')),
                DataCell(Text('alice@example.com')),
              ]),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code defines a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the flutter_data_table package.
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Data Table Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a Padding widget that adds some space around the DataTable.
// 5. The DataTable widget is created with three columns: Name, Age, and Email.
// 6. Three DataRow widgets are defined, each containing DataCell widgets that display the data.
// 7. This example showcases how to create a simple data table with static data, which can be expanded to include dynamic data and additional features like sorting and filtering.
