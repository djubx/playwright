```dart
CarouselGrid(
  items: [
    // List of items to display in the grid

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:carousel_grid/carousel_grid.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Carousel Grid Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  List<String> _items = [
    'Item 1',
    'Item 2',
    'Item 3',
    'Item 4',
    'Item 5',
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Carousel Grid Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CarouselGrid(
          items: _items,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return Container(
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                border: Border.all(color: Colors.grey),
              ),
              child: Center(
                child: Text(_items[index]),
              ),
            );
          },
          gridLayout: GridLayout(
            crossAxisCount: 3,
            mainAxisSpacing: 10,
            crossAxisSpacing: 10,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a grid of items.
// 2. The user can scroll the grid horizontally or vertically to view more items.
// 3. The user can tap on an item to select it.
// 4. The app displays a placeholder widget while loading the selected item.
// 5. Once the item is loaded, the app displays the item in the grid.
// 6. The user can continue to scroll and select items in the grid.
```

// The code above creates a basic carousel grid with a list of items and a customized grid layout.
// The grid layout is defined with a cross-axis count of 3, main-axis spacing of 10, and cross-axis spacing of 10.
// The item builder returns a container with a border and a centered text widget for each item in the grid.
// The carousel grid is displayed in the center of the screen with a scaffold and an app bar.
// The application flow is described in the comments above.
