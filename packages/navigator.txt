// Here's a step-by-step explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The user launches the app and is presented with the HomeScreen.
// 2. The user clicks the "Go to Settings" button, which navigates them to the SettingsScreen.
// 3. The user clicks the "Go back to Home" button, which navigates them back to the HomeScreen.
// The navigator package handles the navigation state and history, allowing the user to move back and forth between the different screens.

// Final summary: The code flows by creating a Navigator widget and defining our routes. We then create our HomeScreen and SettingsScreen widgets, which contain buttons that allow the user to navigate between the different screens. The navigator package handles the navigation state and history, allowing the user to move back and forth between the different screens.
