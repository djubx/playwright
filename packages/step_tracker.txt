# Step Tracker Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the **step_tracker** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  step_tracker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/step_tracker).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 29 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 29
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for step tracking:

```xml
<key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to motion data to track steps.</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to location data to track steps.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the **step_tracker** package, you can create a simple Flutter widget that initializes the step tracking and displays the step count.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:step_tracker/step_tracker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _stepCount = 0;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize step tracking
    StepTracker.startTracking().then((stepCount) {
      setState(() {
        _stepCount = stepCount;
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Step Tracker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Steps taken: $_stepCount'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the step tracking when the widget is created and updates the UI with the current step count.

# Complete Example of Step Tracker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:step_tracker/step_tracker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _stepCount = 0; // Variable to hold the step count

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start tracking steps when the app initializes
    StepTracker.startTracking().then((stepCount) {
      setState(() {
        _stepCount = stepCount; // Update the step count
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Step Tracker Example'), // App title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Steps taken: $_stepCount'), // Display step count
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, step tracking is initiated.
// 3. The current step count is fetched and stored in the _stepCount variable.
// 4. The UI is updated to display the current step count in the center of the screen.
// 5. As the user walks, the step count will update in real-time, reflecting the user's activity.
```
