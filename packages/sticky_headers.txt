You should consider using the **sticky_headers** package when:
- You have a long list of items that can be grouped into categories.
- You want to improve the usability of your app by keeping headers visible while scrolling.
- You are developing applications that require a clean and organized presentation of data.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: The package is straightforward to integrate into existing Flutter applications.
- **Customizable Headers**: You can customize the appearance of headers to match your app's design.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: The package ensures smooth scrolling behavior, enhancing the overall user experience.
- **Support for Various List Types**: It works seamlessly with different types of scrollable lists, including `ListView` and `CustomScrollView`.

In summary, the **sticky_headers** package is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to enhance their applications with sticky header functionality, providing a better-organized and more user-friendly interface.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Sticky Headers

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **sticky_headers** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **sticky_headers** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sticky_headers: ^0.2.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple example to demonstrate how to use sticky headers in a Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sticky_headers/sticky_headers.dart';
```

2. Create a basic Flutter app structure and implement sticky headers in a `ListView`.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sticky_headers/sticky_headers.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sticky Headers Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Sticky Headers Example'),
        ),
        body: StickyHeaderList(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class StickyHeaderList extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: 20, // Total number of items
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        // Determine the header for each section
        String header = (index ~/ 5) % 2 == 0 ? 'Header ${(index ~/ 5) + 1}' : 'Header ${(index ~/ 5) + 1} (B)';
        
        // Create a sticky header for every 5 items
        return StickyHeader(
          header: Container(
            color: Colors.blue,
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text(
              header,
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ),
          content: Container(
            height: 100,
            color: index.isEven ? Colors.grey[300] : Colors.grey[200],
            child: Center(
              child: Text('Item $index', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18)),
            ),
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold containing an AppBar and the StickyHeaderList.
// 3. StickyHeaderList uses a ListView.builder to create a scrollable list of items.
// 4. For every 5 items, a sticky header is created using the StickyHeader widget.
// 5. The header displays the section title, while the content displays the individual items.
// 6. As the user scrolls, the headers remain visible at the top of the screen, enhancing navigation through the list.
```
