Here's a detailed technical blog on the "split_view" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Split View Flutter Package

The **split_view** Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to create responsive and flexible layouts by splitting the screen into multiple resizable panes. This package is particularly useful for applications that require side-by-side views, such as code editors, file explorers, or any app that benefits from displaying two or more widgets simultaneously.

## When to Use

You might consider using the **split_view** package in scenarios such as:
- Building a code editor where the user can view code and its output side by side.
- Creating a file manager that displays file details alongside a file list.
- Developing a chat application that shows a conversation list next to the chat window.

## Features

- **Resizable Panes**: Users can adjust the size of each pane dynamically.
- **Customizable Layout**: You can define how many panes to display and their initial sizes.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates well with existing Flutter applications.

The **split_view** package enhances user experience by providing a clean and efficient way to manage multiple views within a single screen.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Split View Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **split_view** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  split_view: ^0.3.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Here’s a simple example of how to use the **split_view** package in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:split_view/split_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Split View Example')),
        body: SplitView(
          children: [
            Container(color: Colors.red, child: Center(child: Text('Pane 1'))),
            Container(color: Colors.blue, child: Center(child: Text('Pane 2'))),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple split view with two panes, each displaying a different color and text.

## Step 5: Customizing the Split View

You can customize the split view by adjusting the sizes and adding more panes. Here’s how you can do that:

```dart
SplitView(
  viewMode: SplitViewMode.Horizontal,
  children: [
    Container(color: Colors.red, width: 200, child: Center(child: Text('Pane 1'))),
    Container(color: Colors.blue, child: Center(child: Text('Pane 2'))),
    Container(color: Colors.green, child: Center(child: Text('Pane 3'))),
  ],
)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a horizontal split view with three panes.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the **split_view** package into your Flutter application and customize it to fit your needs.

# Complete Example of Using the Split View Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:split_view/split_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Split View Example')),
        body: SplitView(
          viewMode: SplitViewMode.Horizontal, // Set the view mode to horizontal
          children: [
            Container(
              color: Colors.red, // First pane color
              child: Center(child: Text('Pane 1', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24))),
            ),
            Container(
              color: Colors.blue, // Second pane color
              child: Center(child: Text('Pane 2', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24))),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Split View Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a SplitView widget, which allows for horizontal splitting of the screen.
// 5. Inside the SplitView, there are two children: a red pane and a blue pane, each containing centered text.
// 6. The SplitView allows users to resize the panes dynamically, providing a flexible layout for the application.
```
