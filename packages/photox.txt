# Setting Up and Using the Photox Package

## Installation
To get started with the Photox package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  photox: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/photox).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions to allow access to the photo library:
   ```xml
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library to edit images.</string>
   ```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use Photox to apply a filter to an image.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:photox/photox.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Photox Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Load an image from the gallery
              final image = await Photox.loadImageFromGallery();
              // Apply a filter
              final filteredImage = await Photox.applyFilter(image, FilterType.sepia);
              // Display the filtered image
              Photox.displayImage(filteredImage);
            },
            child: Text('Edit Image'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we load an image from the gallery, apply a sepia filter, and then display the modified image.

# Complete Example of Using Photox

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:photox/photox.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Photox Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Load an image from the gallery
              final image = await Photox.loadImageFromGallery();
              // Apply a filter
              final filteredImage = await Photox.applyFilter(image, FilterType.sepia);
              // Display the filtered image
              Photox.displayImage(filteredImage);
            },
            child: Text('Edit Image'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. The home of the app is a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the app triggers an asynchronous function.
// 5. This function loads an image from the user's gallery using Photox.
// 6. After loading the image, it applies a sepia filter to the image.
// 7. Finally, the modified image is displayed on the screen using Photox's display function.
```

In summary, the Photox package provides a robust solution for image processing in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, developers can easily integrate image editing features into their apps, enhancing user engagement and functionality.
