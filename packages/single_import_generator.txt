// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, which starts the `main` function.
// 2. The `main` function runs the `MyApp` widget, which builds the app's UI.
// 3. The `MyApp` widget uses the `MaterialApp` widget to define the app's title and home page.
// 4. The home page is defined by the `MyHomePage` widget, which builds a scaffold with an app bar and a body.
// 5. The body of the scaffold contains a column with a text widget and a `MyWidget` widget.
// 6. The `MyWidget` widget is defined in a separate file and is included in the generated import file.
// 7. When the user runs the app, the `MyWidget` widget is displayed on the screen.

// This example demonstrates how the `single_import_generator` package simplifies import management in large-scale projects.
// By generating a single import file for all widgets, models, and other classes, developers can reduce clutter and noise in their code and improve code readability and maintainability.
