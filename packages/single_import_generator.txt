# Overview of the single_import_generator Flutter Package

The `single_import_generator` package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the management of Dart imports in Flutter projects. It automatically consolidates multiple imports from the same library into a single import statement, enhancing code readability and maintainability. This package is particularly useful in large projects where managing numerous imports can become cumbersome.

## When to Use This Package
- **Large Codebases**: In projects with many files and dependencies, keeping track of imports can be challenging. This package helps streamline the import statements.
- **Code Refactoring**: When refactoring code, you may end up with redundant imports. This package can help clean them up automatically.
- **Collaboration**: In team environments, different developers may add imports inconsistently. This package ensures a uniform import style.

## Key Features
- **Automatic Import Consolidation**: Merges multiple imports from the same library into a single line.
- **Customizable**: Allows configuration options to tailor the import behavior to your project's needs.
- **Integration with Build Systems**: Works seamlessly with Flutter's build system, ensuring that your imports are always optimized.

By using `single_import_generator`, developers can focus more on writing code rather than managing imports, leading to cleaner and more efficient codebases.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using single_import_generator

## Installation
To get started with the `single_import_generator` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  single_import_generator: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/single_import_generator).

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Configuration
The `single_import_generator` package requires minimal configuration. You can create a configuration file named `single_import_generator.yaml` in the root of your project to customize its behavior. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

```yaml
# single_import_generator.yaml
consolidate: true
```

This configuration enables the consolidation of imports. You can add more options as needed based on your project requirements.

## Usage
Once installed and configured, you can run the generator to consolidate your imports. Use the following command:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This command will analyze your Dart files and consolidate the imports as specified in your configuration.

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: No additional configuration is required for Android. The package works seamlessly with the existing Flutter build process.
- **iOS**: Similar to Android, there are no specific configurations needed for iOS. Ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage your Dart imports using the `single_import_generator` package.

# Complete Example of Using single_import_generator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Importing Flutter Material package
import 'package:example/feature_one.dart'; // Importing feature one
import 'package:example/feature_two.dart'; // Importing feature two

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Starting the application with RealFlutter widget
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Single Import Generator Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue, // Setting the primary color theme
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(), // Setting the home screen of the app
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'), // Title of the app bar
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to the Single Import Generator Example!', // Welcome message
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => FeatureOneScreen()), // Navigating to FeatureOneScreen
                );
              },
              child: Text('Go to Feature One'), // Button text
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => FeatureTwoScreen()), // Navigating to FeatureTwoScreen
                );
              },
              child: Text('Go to Feature Two'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class FeatureOneScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Feature One'), // Title of the feature one screen
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is Feature One'), // Displaying feature one text
      ),
    );
  }
}

class FeatureTwoScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Feature Two'), // Title of the feature two screen
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is Feature Two'), // Displaying feature two text
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to HomeScreen, which contains a welcome message and two buttons.
// 4. Each button navigates to a different feature screen (FeatureOneScreen or FeatureTwoScreen) when pressed.
// 5. Feature screens display simple text indicating which feature is being viewed.
