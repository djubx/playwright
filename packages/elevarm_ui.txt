// This is the main entry point of the app, where we create a new instance of the MyApp widget.
// The MyApp widget is a stateless widget that wraps the entire app and provides a basic material design theme.
// The MyHomePage widget is a stateful widget that represents the home page of the app.
// The MyHomePage widget uses the Scaffold widget to create a basic material design layout, with an app bar and a body.
// The body of the MyHomePage widget is a Center widget that contains a Column widget with two children: an ElevatedButton and a Text widget.
// The ElevatedButton widget is used to create a raised button that responds to user input.
// The Text widget is used to display a message to the user.

// When the user presses the button, the onPressed callback is called, which can be used to handle the button press.
// In this example, we don't do anything when the button is pressed, but in a real app, you would typically use this callback to perform some action.

// The SizedBox widget is used to add some space between the button and the text.
// The Text widget is used to display a message to the user.

// Overall, this is a very basic example of how to use the ElevArm UI package to create a simple app with a material design theme.
// In a real app, you would typically use more advanced features of the package, such as the responsive design capabilities and the customizable themes.
