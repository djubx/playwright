# Setting Up and Using the elevarm_ui Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `elevarm_ui` package and provide guidance on how to use it effectively in your Flutter projects.

## Installation

To add the `elevarm_ui` package to your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file.
2. Add the following line under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     elevarm_ui: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

3. Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

Once the package is installed, you can start using its widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use a customizable button from the `elevarm_ui` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:elevarm_ui/elevarm_ui.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Elevate Your UI')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevarmButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action when button is pressed
          },
          text: 'Click Me',
          style: ElevarmButtonStyle.primary,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the `elevarm_ui` package and use the `ElevarmButton` widget to create a button with a primary style.

# Complete Example of Using elevarm_ui

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `elevarm_ui` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:elevarm_ui/elevarm_ui.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Elevate Your UI Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Elevate Your UI')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Using ElevarmButton from the elevarm_ui package
            ElevarmButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
                );
              },
              text: 'Click Me',
              style: ElevarmButtonStyle.primary,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between buttons
            // Another button with a different style
            ElevarmButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action for the second button
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Second Button Pressed!')),
                );
              },
              text: 'Another Button',
              style: ElevarmButtonStyle.secondary,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The home property is set to RealFlutter, which is the main screen of the app.
// In RealFlutter, we create a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// Inside the Center widget, we use a Column to arrange two buttons vertically.
// The first button is an ElevarmButton with a primary style.
// When pressed, it shows a SnackBar with a message.
// The second button is also an ElevarmButton but with a secondary style.
// It also shows a SnackBar when pressed, demonstrating the use of multiple buttons.
// This example showcases how to use the elevarm_ui package to create interactive UI elements.
