# Notification Listener Service Flutter Package

The `notification_listener_service` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to listen to notifications from the Android notification bar. This package is particularly useful for applications that need to interact with notifications, such as messaging apps, task managers, or any app that requires real-time updates from notifications.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `notification_listener_service` package in scenarios such as:
- **Messaging Applications**: To display incoming messages in real-time without requiring the user to open the app.
- **Task Management**: To track notifications from other apps and manage tasks based on those notifications.
- **Custom Notification Handling**: To create a custom notification center within your app that aggregates notifications from various sources.

## Features

- **Real-time Notification Listening**: Capture notifications as they arrive.
- **Notification Details**: Access detailed information about each notification, including title, body, and additional data.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Notification Listener Service

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `notification_listener_service` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `notification_listener_service` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  notification_listener_service: ^0.0.1 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Android Configuration

Since this package primarily targets Android, you need to make some configurations in your Android project.

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and service declaration:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE" />
<application>
    ...
    <service android:name="com.example.notification_listener_service.NotificationListenerService" android:permission="android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE" android:exported="true"/>
</application>
```

2. **Enable Notification Access**: Users must enable notification access for your app. This can be done by directing them to the notification access settings.

## Step 3: iOS Configuration

Currently, the `notification_listener_service` package does not support iOS for listening to notifications. However, you can still use it for Android applications.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. **Import the Package**:

```dart
import 'package:notification_listener_service/notification_listener_service.dart';
```

2. **Initialize the Listener**:

You can create a listener in your main application file. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to start listening to notifications:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  NotificationListenerService().startListening();
}
```

3. **Handle Notifications**:

You can handle notifications by listening to the stream provided by the package:

```dart
NotificationListenerService().notificationStream.listen((notification) {
  // Handle the notification
  print('Received notification: ${notification.title}');
});
```

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `notification_listener_service` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Notification Listener Service

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:notification_listener_service/notification_listener_service.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  // Start listening to notifications as soon as the app starts
  NotificationListenerService().startListening();
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Notification Listener Demo',
      home: NotificationHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NotificationHomePageState createState() => _NotificationHomePageState();
}

class _NotificationHomePageState extends State<NotificationHomePage> {
  // List to hold notifications
  List<NotificationData> notifications = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Listen to the notification stream
    NotificationListenerService().notificationStream.listen((notification) {
      // Add the received notification to the list
      setState(() {
        notifications.add(notification);
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Notification Listener'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: notifications.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          // Display each notification in a list
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(notifications[index].title ?? 'No Title'),
            subtitle: Text(notifications[index].body ?? 'No Body'),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by running the MyApp widget.
// 2. In the main function, we call startListening to begin listening for notifications.
// 3. The NotificationHomePage widget is created, which initializes a list to store notifications.
// 4. In the initState method, we set up a listener for the notification stream.
// 5. When a notification is received, it is added to the notifications list, and the UI is updated.
// 6. The notifications are displayed in a ListView, showing the title and body of each notification.
