## Features

- **Customizable**: You can customize the size and color of the icons to fit your application's design.

## Example Usage

To use the `fluentui_icons` package, you can simply import it into your Flutter project and start using the icons in your widgets. Here’s a quick example:

```dart
import 'package:fluentui_icons/fluentui_icons.dart';

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using FluentUI Icons

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started with the `fluentui_icons` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fluentui_icons: ^1.1.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the icons, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:fluentui_icons/fluentui_icons.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Icons in Your Widgets

You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Here’s how to use an icon in a `Container`:

```dart
Container(
  child: Icon(
    FluentIcons.add_24_filled,
    size: 50,
    color: Colors.green,
  ),
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations

- **Icon Size**: Adjust the icon size based on the design requirements of your application. Use the `size` property to set the desired dimensions.
- **Color Customization**: Use the `color` property to match the icon color with your app's theme.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate and use the `fluentui_icons` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of FluentUI Icons in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fluentui_icons/fluentui_icons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fluent UI Icons Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Fluent UI Icons Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying an add icon
            Icon(
              FluentIcons.add_24_filled,
              size: 100,
              color: Colors.green,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Displaying a delete icon
            Icon(
              FluentIcons.delete_24_filled,
              size: 100,
              color: Colors.red,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Displaying a settings icon
            Icon(
              FluentIcons.settings_24_filled,
              size: 100,
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. In HomePage, a Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual structure.
// 5. The AppBar displays the title of the app.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 7. A Column widget is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 8. Three Fluent UI icons (add, delete, settings) are displayed with different colors and sizes.
// 9. Each icon is separated by a SizedBox for spacing.
