# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Advanced Icon Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **advanced_icon** package, you first need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  advanced_icon: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using it:

```dart
import 'package:advanced_icon/advanced_icon.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Advanced Icons

You can now use the `AdvancedIcon` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AdvancedIcon(
  icon: Icons.favorite,
  size: 50.0,
  color: Colors.red,
  animated: true,
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle icon press
  },
);
```

This widget allows you to specify the icon, size, color, and whether it should be animated. The `onPressed` callback lets you define what happens when the icon is tapped.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the **advanced_icon** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the Advanced Icon Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advanced_icon/advanced_icon.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Advanced Icon Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Advanced Icon Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying an animated advanced icon
              AdvancedIcon(
                icon: Icons.favorite,
                size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
                animated: true, // Enabling animation
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action to perform when the icon is pressed
                  print('Favorite icon pressed!');
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying another advanced icon with different properties
              AdvancedIcon(
                icon: Icons.star,
                size: 80.0, // Different size for this icon
                color: Colors.yellow, // Different color
                animated: false, // No animation for this icon
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action to perform when the star icon is pressed
                  print('Star icon pressed!');
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange two AdvancedIcon widgets vertically.
// 5. The first AdvancedIcon is a red heart icon that is animated and prints a message when pressed.
// 6. The second AdvancedIcon is a yellow star icon that is not animated and also prints a message when pressed.
// 7. The layout is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes while maintaining the icon's properties.
