# Tutorial: Setting Up the Paymob Payment Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the paymob_payment package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the paymob_payment package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  paymob_payment: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/paymob_payment).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Package
In your main Dart file, import the package and initialize it:

```dart
import 'package:paymob_payment/paymob_payment.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
To use the package, you will need to create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and call the necessary methods to initiate a payment. 

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate a payment:

```dart
RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();
realFlutter.startPayment(
  amount: 100.0, // Amount to be charged
  currency: 'EGP', // Currency code
  orderId: '12345', // Unique order ID
);
```

This will start the payment process, and you can handle the response accordingly.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the paymob_payment package into your Flutter application, enabling secure and efficient payment processing.

# Complete Example of Paymob Payment Integration

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:paymob_payment/paymob_payment.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Paymob Payment Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  // Create an instance of the RealFlutter class
  RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();

  // Function to initiate payment
  void initiatePayment() {
    // Start the payment process
    realFlutter.startPayment(
      amount: 100.0, // Amount to be charged
      currency: 'EGP', // Currency code
      orderId: '12345', // Unique order ID
    ).then((response) {
      // Handle the payment response
      if (response['success']) {
        // Payment was successful
        showDialog(
          context: context,
          builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
            title: Text('Payment Successful'),
            content: Text('Your payment was processed successfully!'),
            actions: [
              TextButton(
                onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                child: Text('OK'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        );
      } else {
        // Payment failed
        showDialog(
          context: context,
          builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
            title: Text('Payment Failed'),
            content: Text('There was an error processing your payment.'),
            actions: [
              TextButton(
                onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                child: Text('OK'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        );
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Paymob Payment Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: initiatePayment, // Call initiatePayment on button press
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The PaymentScreen widget is displayed, containing a button to initiate payment.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the initiatePayment function is called.
// 4. The startPayment method of the RealFlutter instance is invoked, which processes the payment.
// 5. Based on the response, a dialog is shown indicating whether the payment was successful or failed.
