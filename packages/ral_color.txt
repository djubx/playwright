# Setting Up and Using the `ral_color` Package

## Installation

To get started with the `ral_color` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ral_color: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

No additional configuration is required for Android. The package works out of the box.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package

Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to access RAL colors:

```dart
import 'package:ral_color/ral_color.dart';

void main() {
  // Create an instance of the RALColor class
  RALColor ralColor = RALColor();

  // Get a specific color by its code
  Color myColor = ralColor.getColor('RAL 5010'); // RAL 5010 is known as "Gentian Blue"
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create an instance of the `RALColor` class and retrieve a specific color using its RAL code.

# Complete Example of Using the `ral_color` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ral_color/ral_color.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'RAL Color Example',
      home: ColorDisplayScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ColorDisplayScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an instance of the RALColor class
    RALColor ralColor = RALColor();

    // Get a specific color by its code
    Color gentianBlue = ralColor.getColor('RAL 5010'); // RAL 5010 is known as "Gentian Blue"
    Color trafficRed = ralColor.getColor('RAL 3020'); // RAL 3020 is known as "Traffic Red"

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('RAL Color Display'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 200,
            color: gentianBlue, // Display Gentian Blue
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'RAL 5010',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 200,
            color: trafficRed, // Display Traffic Red
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'RAL 3020',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (ColorDisplayScreen).
// 3. ColorDisplayScreen creates an instance of RALColor to access RAL colors.
// 4. It retrieves two colors: Gentian Blue (RAL 5010) and Traffic Red (RAL 3020).
// 5. The Scaffold widget provides a structure with an AppBar and a body.
// 6. The body contains two containers, each displaying one of the RAL colors with their respective codes.
// 7. The colors are displayed in large boxes with centered text showing the RAL code.
