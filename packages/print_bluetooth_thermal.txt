## Setup Process

To get started with the `print_bluetooth_thermal` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency
Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  print_bluetooth_thermal: ^latest_version
```

Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/print_bluetooth_thermal).

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android
1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

2. **Bluetooth Settings**: Ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on the device.

#### iOS
1. **Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request Bluetooth permissions:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to print.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to print.</string>
```

2. **Bluetooth Settings**: Ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on the device.

### Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:print_bluetooth_thermal/print_bluetooth_thermal.dart';
```

### Step 4: Initialize and Use the Package
You can now initialize the package and use its features to print to a Bluetooth thermal printer. 

```dart
// Example of initializing and using the package will be shown in the Complete Example section.
```

With these steps, you are ready to start using the `print_bluetooth_thermal` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:print_bluetooth_thermal/print_bluetooth_thermal.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bluetooth Thermal Printer Example',
      home: PrinterHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class PrinterHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PrinterHomePageState createState() => _PrinterHomePageState();
}

class _PrinterHomePageState extends State<PrinterHomePage> {
  List<BluetoothDevice> devices = [];
  BluetoothDevice? selectedDevice;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch the list of available Bluetooth devices
    _getBluetoothDevices();
  }

  // Function to get available Bluetooth devices
  void _getBluetoothDevices() async {
    devices = await PrintBluetoothThermal.getBluetoothDevices();
    setState(() {});
  }

  // Function to print a sample receipt
  void _printReceipt() async {
    if (selectedDevice != null) {
      // Connect to the selected Bluetooth device
      await PrintBluetoothThermal.connect(selectedDevice!);
      // Print sample text
      await PrintBluetoothThermal.printCustom("Hello, World!", 2, 1);
      // Disconnect after printing
      await PrintBluetoothThermal.disconnect();
    } else {
      // Show an error if no device is selected
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text("Please select a Bluetooth device")),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Bluetooth Thermal Printer')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Dropdown to select Bluetooth device
          DropdownButton<BluetoothDevice>(
            hint: Text("Select Bluetooth Device"),
            value: selectedDevice,
            onChanged: (BluetoothDevice? newValue) {
              setState(() {
                selectedDevice = newValue;
              });
            },
            items: devices.map((BluetoothDevice device) {
              return DropdownMenuItem<BluetoothDevice>(
                value: device,
                child: Text(device.name),
              );
            }).toList(),
          ),
          // Button to print receipt
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _printReceipt,
            child: Text("Print Receipt"),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts by running the `RealFlutter` widget, which sets up the main MaterialApp.
// The `PrinterHomePage` widget is displayed, which contains a dropdown for selecting Bluetooth devices and a button to print a receipt.
// In the `initState` method, the app fetches available Bluetooth devices and updates the state.
// When a user selects a device from the dropdown, it updates the `selectedDevice` state.
// When the "Print Receipt" button is pressed, the app checks if a device is selected.
// If a device is selected, it connects to the device, prints a sample message, and then disconnects.
// If no device is selected, it shows a snackbar message prompting the user to select a device.
