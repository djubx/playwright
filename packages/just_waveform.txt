# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Just Waveform

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **just_waveform** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **just_waveform** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  just_waveform: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/just_waveform).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access the microphone or audio files:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio recording.</string>
<key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your music library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the waveform visualization.

# Complete Example of Just Waveform

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:just_waveform/just_waveform.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Just Waveform Example',
      home: WaveformScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class WaveformScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WaveformScreenState createState() => _WaveformScreenState();
}

class _WaveformScreenState extends State<WaveformScreen> {
  // Path to the audio file
  final String audioPath = 'assets/audio/sample_audio.mp3';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Waveform Visualization'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: FutureBuilder<Waveform>(
          // Load the waveform data from the audio file
          future: JustWaveform.load(audioPath),
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
              return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator
            } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
              return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'); // Show error message
            } else {
              // Display the waveform
              return Container(
                height: 200,
                child: WaveformWidget(
                  waveform: snapshot.data!,
                  color: Colors.blue, // Customize waveform color
                  strokeWidth: 2.0, // Customize line thickness
                ),
              );
            }
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and the WaveformScreen as the home screen.
// 3. The WaveformScreen is a stateful widget that manages the state of the waveform visualization.
// 4. In the build method of _WaveformScreenState, we define the path to the audio file.
// 5. We use a FutureBuilder to load the waveform data asynchronously from the specified audio file.
// 6. While the data is loading, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 7. If an error occurs during loading, an error message is shown.
// 8. Once the waveform data is successfully loaded, we display it using the WaveformWidget.
// 9. The WaveformWidget is customized with a specific color and stroke width for better visualization.
```
