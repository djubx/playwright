# flutter_video_view: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_video_view`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_video_view: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_video_view).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following keys to allow access to the internet and local files:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select videos.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_video_view` package, you can create a simple widget that initializes the video player. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_video_view/flutter_video_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Video Player Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: VideoView(
            videoUrl: 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // Replace with your video URL
            autoPlay: true,
            looping: true,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple video player that plays a video from a URL. The `autoPlay` and `looping` properties are set to true for continuous playback.

# Complete Example of flutter_video_view

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_video_view/flutter_video_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Video Player Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the VideoView widget
          child: VideoView(
            videoUrl: 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // URL of the video to be played
            autoPlay: true, // Automatically play the video
            looping: true, // Loop the video playback
            onVideoFinished: () {
              // Callback when the video finishes playing
              print('Video has finished playing');
            },
            onError: (error) {
              // Handle any errors during video playback
              print('Error occurred: $error');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// The MaterialApp widget provides the basic structure of the app.
// The Scaffold widget creates a visual structure with an AppBar and a body.
// Inside the body, we center the VideoView widget.
// The VideoView is configured to play a video from a specified URL.
// It automatically plays and loops the video.
// Callbacks are provided to handle video completion and errors.
// This setup allows for a straightforward video playback experience in the app.
```

### Summary of Application Flow
The application begins with the `RealFlutter` widget, which is the main entry point. It uses a `MaterialApp` to set up the app's theme and structure. The `Scaffold` widget provides a basic layout with an `AppBar` and a centered `VideoView` widget. The `VideoView` is configured to play a video from a specified URL, with options for autoplay and looping enabled. Additionally, it includes error handling and a callback for when the video finishes playing, making it a robust solution for video playback in Flutter applications.
