# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Super Hot Key Package

## Installation
To get started with the **super_hot_key** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  super_hot_key: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/super_hot_key).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permission inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
```

### For iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request permission for keyboard shortcuts:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the microphone for keyboard shortcuts.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the **super_hot_key** package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:super_hot_key/super_hot_key.dart';
```

2. Initialize the hotkey manager and register your hotkeys:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the hotkey manager
    SuperHotKey.registerHotKey(
      KeyCombination.controlAlt('H'), // Define your hotkey
      (key) {
        // Action to perform when the hotkey is pressed
        print('Hotkey pressed!');
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the hotkey manager
    SuperHotKey.unregisterAll();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Super Hot Key Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Press Ctrl + Alt + H')),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application that listens for the `Ctrl + Alt + H` hotkey and prints a message to the console when pressed.

# Complete Example of Using the Super Hot Key Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:super_hot_key/super_hot_key.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Register a global hotkey (Ctrl + Alt + H)
    SuperHotKey.registerHotKey(
      KeyCombination.controlAlt('H'), // Define the hotkey combination
      (key) {
        // Action to perform when the hotkey is pressed
        print('Hotkey pressed!'); // Log to console
        // You can also show a dialog or perform other actions here
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Unregister all hotkeys when the widget is disposed
    SuperHotKey.unregisterAll();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Super Hot Key Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Press Ctrl + Alt + H'), // Instructions for the user
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. In the RealFlutter widget, we register a hotkey (Ctrl + Alt + H) in the initState() method.
// 4. When the hotkey is pressed, a message is printed to the console.
// 5. The dispose() method unregisters all hotkeys to prevent memory leaks.
// 6. The UI displays a simple message instructing the user to press the hotkey.
