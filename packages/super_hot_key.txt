// This code defines a basic Flutter app with a single page.
// The page displays a text message and listens for the Ctrl + A hotkey.
// When the hotkey is pressed, it prints a message to the console.
// The hotkey is registered in the initState method and unregistered in the dispose method.
// This ensures that the hotkey is only active when the page is visible.

// The code uses the SuperHotKey package to define and register the hotkey.
// The HotKey class is used to define the hotkey, specifying the key and modifiers.
// The onPressed callback is used to trigger the action when the hotkey is pressed.

// The code also demonstrates how to use the SuperHotKey package to register and unregister hotkeys.
// The registerHotKey method is used to register the hotkey, and the unregisterHotKey method is used to unregister it.

// Overall, this code provides a simple example of how to use the SuperHotKey package in a Flutter app.
