# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_swiper_null_safety

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_swiper_null_safety` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_swiper_null_safety: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the swiper, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_swiper_null_safety/flutter_swiper.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

You can now use the `Swiper` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
Swiper(
  itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
    return Image.network(
      'https://example.com/image$index.jpg',
      fit: BoxFit.fill,
    );
  },
  itemCount: 5,
  pagination: SwiperPagination(),
  control: SwiperControl(),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS
For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if you are loading images from the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Customization Options

The `Swiper` widget comes with various customization options, such as:
- **Autoplay**: Enable automatic swiping.
- **Loop**: Enable infinite looping of items.
- **Pagination**: Customize pagination indicators.
- **Control**: Add navigation controls.

Example with customization:

```dart
Swiper(
  itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
    return Image.network(
      'https://example.com/image$index.jpg',
      fit: BoxFit.fill,
    );
  },
  itemCount: 5,
  autoplay: true,
  loop: true,
  pagination: SwiperPagination(
    alignment: Alignment.bottomCenter,
    builder: DotSwiperPaginationBuilder(
      color: Colors.grey,
      activeColor: Colors.blue,
    ),
  ),
  control: SwiperControl(),
)
```

With these steps, you can easily set up and customize the `flutter_swiper_null_safety` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_swiper_null_safety

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_swiper_null_safety/flutter_swiper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Swiper Example',
      home: SwiperExample(),
    );
  }
}

class SwiperExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Swiper Example'),
      ),
      body: Swiper(
        // The itemBuilder is a function that returns the widget for each item in the swiper.
        itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
          // Here we return an Image widget for each index.
          return Image.network(
            'https://example.com/image$index.jpg',
            fit: BoxFit.fill,
          );
        },
        // The total number of items in the swiper.
        itemCount: 5,
        // Enable autoplay for the swiper.
        autoplay: true,
        // Enable infinite looping of items.
        loop: true,
        // Customize pagination indicators.
        pagination: SwiperPagination(
          alignment: Alignment.bottomCenter,
          builder: DotSwiperPaginationBuilder(
            color: Colors.grey,
            activeColor: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
        // Add navigation controls.
        control: SwiperControl(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (SwiperExample).
// 3. SwiperExample builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing the Swiper widget.
// 4. The Swiper widget uses itemBuilder to create an Image widget for each item.
// 5. The swiper has 5 items, autoplay enabled, and infinite looping.
// 6. Pagination and control widgets are added for better navigation.
// 7. Users can swipe through images, and the swiper will automatically transition between them.
```
