# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Quick Settings

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **quick_settings** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **quick_settings** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  quick_settings: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions. For example, if you are using settings related to network or location, you might need to add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add any required permissions, such as:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your location.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your location at all times.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:quick_settings/quick_settings.dart';
```

2. Initialize the Quick Settings in your main widget:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Quick Settings Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the quick settings panel
              QuickSettings.show();
            },
            child: Text('Open Quick Settings'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Customize the settings you want to display. You can add toggles, sliders, or dropdowns based on your requirements.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can easily integrate the **quick_settings** package into your Flutter application, providing users with a convenient way to access and modify settings quickly.

# Complete Example of Quick Settings in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:quick_settings/quick_settings.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize Quick Settings
    QuickSettings.init();

    // Add settings to the Quick Settings panel
    QuickSettings.addSetting("Toggle Sound", (value) {
      // Handle sound toggle
      print("Sound toggled: $value");
    }, defaultValue: true);

    QuickSettings.addSetting("Brightness", (value) {
      // Handle brightness change
      print("Brightness set to: $value");
    }, defaultValue: 50, slider: true);

    QuickSettings.addSetting("Theme", (value) {
      // Handle theme change
      print("Theme changed to: $value");
    }, defaultValue: "Light", dropdown: ["Light", "Dark"]);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Quick Settings Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the quick settings panel
              QuickSettings.show();
            },
            child: Text('Open Quick Settings'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. Inside the RealFlutter widget, QuickSettings is initialized.
// 3. Three settings are added to the Quick Settings panel: 
//    - A toggle for sound, which prints the toggle state to the console.
//    - A slider for brightness, which prints the brightness level to the console.
//    - A dropdown for theme selection, which prints the selected theme to the console.
// 4. The main UI consists of a button that, when pressed, opens the Quick Settings panel.
// 5. Users can interact with the settings, and the corresponding actions will be printed to the console.
