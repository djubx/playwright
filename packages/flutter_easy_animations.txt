# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_easy_animations`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_easy_animations` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_easy_animations: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a fade animation using `flutter_easy_animations`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_easy_animations/flutter_easy_animations.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Animations Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FadeAnimation(
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
            child: Text(
              'Hello, Flutter!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a text widget with a fade-in animation. The `FadeAnimation` widget takes a `duration` parameter to control how long the animation lasts.

# Complete Example: A Functional Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_easy_animations/flutter_easy_animations.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Animations Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using the FadeAnimation widget to animate the text
          child: FadeAnimation(
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the fade animation
            child: Text(
              'Hello, Flutter!', // Text to be animated
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Text style
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget holds a FadeAnimation widget that animates the text "Hello, Flutter!".
// 6. The FadeAnimation widget takes a duration parameter, which controls how long the fade effect lasts.
// 7. When the app runs, the text fades in over a duration of 2 seconds, providing a smooth visual effect.
```
