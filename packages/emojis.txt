# Tutorial: Setting Up the Emojis Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Emojis package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the Emojis package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  emojis: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the minimum deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the Emojis package:

```dart
import 'package:emojis/emojis.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Emojis

You can now use emojis in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display an emoji in a `Text` widget:

```dart
Text(Emojis.smilingFace);
```

This will display a smiling face emoji in your application.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the Emojis package in your Flutter app!

# Complete Example of Using the Emojis Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:emojis/emojis.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Emojis Flutter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Emojis in Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a smiling face emoji
              Text(
                Emojis.smilingFace,
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 50), // Customizing emoji size
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between emojis
              // Displaying a thumbs up emoji
              Text(
                Emojis.thumbsUp,
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 50), // Customizing emoji size
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between emojis
              // Displaying a heart emoji
              Text(
                Emojis.redHeart,
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 50), // Customizing emoji size
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the emoji Text widgets vertically.
// 5. Each Text widget displays a different emoji, with a specified font size for visibility.
// 6. SizedBox widgets are used to add spacing between the emojis for better layout.
// 7. The app will display a simple interface with three emojis: a smiling face, a thumbs up, and a red heart.
