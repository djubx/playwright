# Overview of the time_listener Flutter Package

The `time_listener` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers who need to monitor and respond to time changes in their applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require real-time updates based on time, such as countdown timers, clocks, or any feature that needs to react to the passage of time.

## When to Use This Package
- **Countdown Timers**: For applications that need to display a countdown to an event.
- **Real-Time Clocks**: To show the current time and update it every second.
- **Scheduled Notifications**: For apps that need to trigger actions at specific times.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Updates**: Automatically listens for time changes and updates the UI accordingly.
- **Customizable Intervals**: Allows developers to set custom intervals for updates.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.

Overall, the `time_listener` package is an excellent choice for any Flutter project that requires time-based functionality.

# Setting Up and Using the time_listener Package

## Installation
To use the `time_listener` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  time_listener: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. The package works out of the box.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `time_listener` package, you will need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:time_listener/time_listener.dart';
```

You can then create a listener in your widget to respond to time changes. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String currentTime = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start listening to time changes
    TimeListener().startListening((time) {
      setState(() {
        currentTime = time.toString();
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop listening when the widget is disposed
    TimeListener().stopListening();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Time Listener Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Current Time: $currentTime'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application that listens for time changes and updates the displayed time accordingly.

# Complete Example of Using the time_listener Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:time_listener/time_listener.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String currentTime = ''; // Variable to hold the current time

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start listening to time changes
    TimeListener().startListening((time) {
      setState(() {
        currentTime = time.toString(); // Update the current time
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop listening when the widget is disposed
    TimeListener().stopListening();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Time Listener Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Current Time: $currentTime'), // Display the current time
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. In the initState method, the TimeListener starts listening for time changes.
// 4. When the time changes, the listener updates the currentTime variable.
// 5. The UI is rebuilt with the new current time displayed in the center of the screen.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, the listener is stopped to prevent memory leaks.
