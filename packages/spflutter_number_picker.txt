# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using spflutter_number_picker

## Installation
To use the `spflutter_number_picker` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  spflutter_number_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. The package works out of the box.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `spflutter_number_picker`, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:spflutter_number_picker/spflutter_number_picker.dart';
```

You can then create a simple number picker widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
NumberPicker(
  value: 0,
  minValue: 0,
  maxValue: 100,
  onChanged: (value) => setState(() => _currentValue = value),
)
```

This code snippet creates a number picker that allows users to select a value between 0 and 100. The `onChanged` callback updates the state with the selected value.

# Complete Example of spflutter_number_picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:spflutter_number_picker/spflutter_number_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _currentValue = 0; // Initialize the current value

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Number Picker Example'), // App title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Selected Value: $_currentValue', // Display the selected value
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between text and picker
              NumberPicker(
                value: _currentValue, // Current value of the picker
                minValue: 0, // Minimum value
                maxValue: 100, // Maximum value
                step: 1, // Step value for increment/decrement
                onChanged: (value) => setState(() => _currentValue = value), // Update state on change
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected number.
// 3. The _currentValue variable holds the currently selected number, initialized to 0.
// 4. The build method constructs the UI, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the Text and NumberPicker vertically.
// 6. The Text widget displays the currently selected value, which updates whenever the user interacts with the NumberPicker.
// 7. The NumberPicker widget allows users to select a number between 0 and 100, updating the _currentValue state on change.
// 8. The UI automatically rebuilds to reflect the new selected value due to the setState call.
