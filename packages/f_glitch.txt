## <-- START_MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:f_glitch/f_glitch.dart';

// Main entry point of the Flutter application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp is the root widget of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'f_glitch Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home to RealFlutter widget
    );
  }
}

// RealFlutter is the main screen of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Glitch Effect Example')), // AppBar with title
      body: Center(
        child: Glitch(
          child: Text(
            'Glitch Me!', // Text that will have the glitch effect
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 40, color: Colors.white), // Text style
          ),
          duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Duration of the glitch effect
          intensity: 0.5, // Intensity of the glitch effect
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main screen.
// 4. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Glitch widget wraps a Text widget.
// 6. The Text widget displays "Glitch Me!" with a specified style.
// 7. The Glitch widget applies a glitch effect to the Text with a duration of 500 milliseconds and an intensity of 0.5.
```

### Summary of Application Flow

The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `MyApp` widget. The `MyApp` widget sets up the `MaterialApp` with a title and theme, and it designates `RealFlutter` as the home screen. The `RealFlutter` widget constructs a `Scaffold` containing an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget. Inside the `Center`, the `Glitch` widget wraps a `Text` widget that displays "Glitch Me!" with a specified style. The `Glitch` widget applies the glitch effect, making the text visually dynamic and engaging.
