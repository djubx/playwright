// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application, and the `MyApp` widget is built.
// 2. The `MyApp` widget returns a `MaterialApp` with a `RealFlutter` widget as its home.
// 3. The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that builds a `Scaffold` with a centered `Column`.
// 4. The `Column` contains a `Glitch` widget with a `Text` child, which applies a glitch effect to the text.
// 5. The `Glitch` widget has properties such as `intensity`, `speed`, and `color` that can be customized.
// 6. When the user presses the "Toggle Glitch" button, the `setState` method is called, which rebuilds the `RealFlutter` widget and toggles the glitch effect.
