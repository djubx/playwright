## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **water_drop_nav_bar** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }

# Complete Example of Water Drop Navigation Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:water_drop_nav_bar/water_drop_nav_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Water Drop Nav Bar Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  // Current index of the selected tab
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  // List of pages to display
  final List<Widget> _pages = [
    Center(child: Text('Home Page')),
    Center(child: Text('Search Page')),
    Center(child: Text('Profile Page')),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Water Drop Navigation Bar'),
      ),
      body: _pages[_currentIndex], // Display the selected page
      bottomNavigationBar: WaterDropNavBar(
        backgroundColor: Colors.white,
        waterDropColor: Colors.blue,
        onItemSelected: (index) {
          setState(() {
            _currentIndex = index; // Update the current index
          });
        },
        barItems: [
          BarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.home),
            title: Text('Home'),
          ),
          BarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.search),
            title: Text('Search'),
          ),
          BarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.person),
            title: Text('Profile'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomePage widget is created, which maintains the state of the selected tab.
// 4. The _pages list contains the different pages to display based on the selected tab.
// 5. The bottom navigation bar is created using WaterDropNavBar, which takes care of the animations and styles.
// 6. When a tab is selected, the onItemSelected callback updates the _currentIndex, causing the body to display the corresponding page.
