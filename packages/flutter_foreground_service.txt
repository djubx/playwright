# Flutter Foreground Service Package

The `flutter_foreground_service` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers who need to run background tasks while ensuring that their application remains responsive and user-friendly. This package allows you to create a foreground service that can perform tasks even when the app is not in the foreground, which is particularly useful for applications that require continuous operation, such as music players, fitness trackers, or location-based services.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_foreground_service` package in scenarios such as:

- **Music Streaming Apps**: To keep the music playing even when the app is minimized.
- **Fitness Tracking**: To track user activity in the background without interruption.
- **Location Tracking**: To provide real-time location updates while the app is not actively being used.

## Features

- **Persistent Notification**: The package allows you to create a persistent notification that informs users that a service is running in the background.
- **Platform Support**: It supports both Android and iOS, with specific configurations for each platform.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is designed to be easy to integrate into existing Flutter applications.

Overall, the `flutter_foreground_service` package is an essential tool for developers looking to enhance the functionality of their Flutter applications by enabling background processing capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_foreground_service

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_foreground_service` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `flutter_foreground_service` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_foreground_service: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Android Configuration

For Android, you need to make some additional configurations:

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and service declaration:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />

<application>
    ...
    <service
        android:name="com.ekalips.flutterforegroundservice.FlutterForegroundService"
        android:permission="android.permission.BIND_JOB_SERVICE"
        android:exported="true"/>
</application>
```

2. **Target SDK Version**: Ensure that your `targetSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 29 or higher.

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        targetSdkVersion 31 // or higher
    }
}
```

## Step 3: iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>location</string>
</array>
```

This allows your app to run in the background for location updates.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that we have configured the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to start a foreground service.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_foreground_service/flutter_foreground_service.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Foreground Service Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to start the foreground service
  void startForegroundService() {
    FlutterForegroundService.startForegroundService(
      notificationTitle: 'Foreground Service',
      notificationContent: 'Running in the background',
      // You can add more parameters as needed
    );
  }

  // Function to stop the foreground service
  void stopForegroundService() {
    FlutterForegroundService.stopForegroundService();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Foreground Service Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: startForegroundService,
              child: Text('Start Foreground Service'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: stopForegroundService,
              child: Text('Stop Foreground Service'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, containing two buttons.
// 3. When the "Start Foreground Service" button is pressed, the startForegroundService function is called.
// 4. This function uses FlutterForegroundService to start a foreground service with a notification.
// 5. When the "Stop Foreground Service" button is pressed, the stopForegroundService function is called.
// 6. This function stops the foreground service, removing the notification and stopping background processing.
```
