# df_log Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To add the `df_log` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  df_log: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/df_log).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to write to external storage if you plan to log to a file. Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you typically do not need additional permissions for logging, but ensure that your app's Info.plist is configured correctly if you are logging to a file.

## Basic Usage
To use the `df_log` package, you need to initialize the logger and start logging messages. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:df_log/df_log.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the logger
  RealFlutter().initLogger();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('df_log Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log an info message
              RealFlutter().logInfo('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the logger in the `main` function and log an info message when the button is pressed.

# df_log Flutter Package: Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:df_log/df_log.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the logger
  RealFlutter().initLogger();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('df_log Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log an info message when the button is pressed
              RealFlutter().logInfo('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. We initialize the logger by calling RealFlutter().initLogger().
// 3. The MyApp widget is created, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 4. Inside the MaterialApp, we have a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 7. Inside the callback, we log an info message using RealFlutter().logInfo().
// 8. This message will be displayed in the console or saved to a file, depending on the logger configuration.
