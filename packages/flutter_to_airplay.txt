# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_to_airplay

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_to_airplay` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `flutter_to_airplay` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_to_airplay: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_to_airplay).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following keys to enable network access for AirPlay:

```xml
<key>NSBonjourServices</key>
<array>
    <string>_airplay._tcp</string>
</array>
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to local network for AirPlay functionality.</string>
```

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_to_airplay/flutter_to_airplay.dart';
```

2. Initialize the AirPlay controller and discover devices:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late FlutterToAirplay airplay;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    airplay = FlutterToAirplay();
    airplay.discoverDevices(); // Start discovering AirPlay devices
  }

  // Additional methods for controlling playback will go here
}
```

3. Implement media control methods (play, pause, stop):

```dart
void playMedia(String url) {
  airplay.play(url); // Play media from the provided URL
}

void pauseMedia() {
  airplay.pause(); // Pause the currently playing media
}

void stopMedia() {
  airplay.stop(); // Stop the media playback
}
```

4. Create a UI to display available devices and control media playback.

With these steps, you can successfully integrate AirPlay functionality into your Flutter application using the `flutter_to_airplay` package.

# Complete Example of flutter_to_airplay

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_to_airplay/flutter_to_airplay.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late FlutterToAirplay airplay; // Declare the AirPlay controller
  List<AirPlayDevice> devices = []; // List to hold discovered devices
  AirPlayDevice? selectedDevice; // Currently selected AirPlay device

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    airplay = FlutterToAirplay();
    airplay.discoverDevices().listen((deviceList) {
      setState(() {
        devices = deviceList; // Update the device list when discovered
      });
    });
  }

  // Method to play media
  void playMedia(String url) {
    if (selectedDevice != null) {
      airplay.play(url, device: selectedDevice!); // Play media on selected device
    }
  }

  // Method to pause media
  void pauseMedia() {
    airplay.pause(); // Pause the currently playing media
  }

  // Method to stop media
  void stopMedia() {
    airplay.stop(); // Stop the media playback
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('AirPlay Example')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Dropdown to select AirPlay device
          DropdownButton<AirPlayDevice>(
            hint: Text('Select AirPlay Device'),
            value: selectedDevice,
            onChanged: (AirPlayDevice? newValue) {
              setState(() {
                selectedDevice = newValue; // Update selected device
              });
            },
            items: devices.map<DropdownMenuItem<AirPlayDevice>>((AirPlayDevice device) {
              return DropdownMenuItem<AirPlayDevice>(
                value: device,
                child: Text(device.name), // Display device name
              );
            }).toList(),
          ),
          // Button to play media
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () => playMedia('https://example.com/media.mp3'), // Example media URL
            child: Text('Play Media'),
          ),
          // Button to pause media
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: pauseMedia,
            child: Text('Pause Media'),
          ),
          // Button to stop media
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: stopMedia,
            child: Text('Stop Media'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app initializes the FlutterToAirplay instance and starts discovering AirPlay devices.
// 2. Discovered devices are displayed in a dropdown menu for user selection.
// 3. The user can select an AirPlay device and press the "Play Media" button to stream audio from a specified URL.
// 4. The user can also pause or stop the media playback using the respective buttons.
// 5. The app updates the UI based on the selected device and the available devices discovered on the network.
```
