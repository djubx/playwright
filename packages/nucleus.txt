# Nucleus Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **Nucleus** package is a powerful state management solution for Flutter applications, designed to simplify the management of application state while promoting a clean architecture. It is particularly useful for developers looking to implement a reactive programming model in their Flutter apps.

## When to Use Nucleus
- **Complex State Management**: When your application has multiple states that need to be managed efficiently.
- **Reactive UI**: If you want your UI to automatically update in response to state changes without manual intervention.
- **Separation of Concerns**: When you want to maintain a clear separation between business logic and UI code.

## Key Features
- **Reactive State Management**: Automatically updates the UI when the state changes.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal boilerplate code, making it easy to integrate into existing projects.
- **Easy to Learn**: Intuitive API that is easy for both beginners and experienced developers to grasp.
- **Support for Multiple States**: Manage different states in a single application seamlessly.

The Nucleus package is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to implement a robust state management solution with minimal overhead.

# Nucleus Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To add the Nucleus package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  nucleus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the Nucleus package, you need to create a state class that extends `NucleusState`. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nucleus/nucleus.dart';

class MyState extends NucleusState {
  int counter = 0;

  void increment() {
    counter++;
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners about the state change
  }
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return NucleusProvider<MyState>(
      create: (context) => MyState(),
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: MyHomePage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final state = Nucleus.of<MyState>(context);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Nucleus Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Counter: ${state.counter}'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: state.increment,
              child: Text('Increment'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple counter application using Nucleus for state management. The `MyState` class holds the counter value and provides a method to increment it. The UI automatically updates when the state changes.

# Complete Example of Nucleus in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nucleus/nucleus.dart';

// Step 1: Define the state class that extends NucleusState
class MyState extends NucleusState {
  int counter = 0; // Step 2: Initialize the counter variable

  // Step 3: Method to increment the counter
  void increment() {
    counter++; // Increment the counter
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners about the state change
  }
}

// Step 4: Create the main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return NucleusProvider<MyState>(
      create: (context) => MyState(), // Step 5: Provide the state to the widget tree
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: MyHomePage(), // Step 6: Set the home page
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Step 7: Create the home page widget
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final state = Nucleus.of<MyState>(context); // Step 8: Access the state

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Nucleus Example')), // Step 9: AppBar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Counter: ${state.counter}'), // Step 10: Display the counter
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: state.increment, // Step 11: Increment button
              child: Text('Increment'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Step 12: Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the `main()` function, which calls `runApp()` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
2. The `RealFlutter` widget creates a `NucleusProvider` that provides an instance of `MyState` to the widget tree.
3. The `MyHomePage` widget accesses the state using `Nucleus.of<MyState>(context)`.
4. The UI displays the current value of the counter and provides a button to increment it.
5. When the button is pressed, the `increment()` method is called, which updates the counter and notifies listeners.
6. The UI automatically rebuilds to reflect the updated counter value.
