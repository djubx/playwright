# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_gcaptcha_v3

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_gcaptcha_v3` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_gcaptcha_v3` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_gcaptcha_v3: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, you need to add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application
        android:label="yourapp"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        
        <!-- Add this meta-data tag -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.gms.recaptcha.api_key"
            android:value="YOUR_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Replace `YOUR_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` with your actual reCAPTCHA site key.

## Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>GoogleReCaptchaSiteKey</key>
<string>YOUR_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY</string>
```

Again, replace `YOUR_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` with your actual reCAPTCHA site key.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that we have configured the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the reCAPTCHA in your app.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gcaptcha_v3/flutter_gcaptcha_v3.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter reCAPTCHA v3 Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _captchaResponse = '';

  // Function to handle reCAPTCHA verification
  Future<void> _verifyCaptcha() async {
    try {
      // Call the verify method from the flutter_gcaptcha_v3 package
      String response = await FlutterGcaptchaV3.verify(
        siteKey: 'YOUR_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY', // Your reCAPTCHA site key
      );

      // Update the state with the response
      setState(() {
        _captchaResponse = response;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during verification
      setState(() {
        _captchaResponse = 'Error: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('reCAPTCHA v3 Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _verifyCaptcha, // Trigger the verification on button press
              child: Text('Verify reCAPTCHA'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Response: $_captchaResponse'), // Display the response
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home of the app is set to RealFlutter, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. In the RealFlutter widget, we define a button that triggers the _verifyCaptcha function when pressed.
// 4. The _verifyCaptcha function calls the verify method from the flutter_gcaptcha_v3 package, passing in the site key.
// 5. If the verification is successful, the response is stored in the _captchaResponse variable and displayed on the screen.
// 6. If an error occurs, it is caught and displayed instead.
```
