# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using TDK Bouncing Widget

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `tdk_bouncingwidget` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tdk_bouncingwidget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the bouncing widget, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:tdk_bouncingwidget/tdk_bouncingwidget.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Bouncing Widget

You can now use the `BouncingWidget` class to wrap any widget you want to animate. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use it:

```dart
BouncingWidget(
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 150), // Duration of the bounce effect
  scaleFactor: 1.5, // Scale factor for the bounce
  onPressed: () {
    // Action to perform on press
    print("Bouncing button pressed!");
  },
  child: Container(
    padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
    color: Colors.blue,
    child: Text(
      "Bounce Me!",
      style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
    ),
  ),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid any compatibility issues:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Optimizations

To ensure smooth animations, consider the following optimizations:
- Use `const` constructors where possible to reduce widget rebuilds.
- Profile your app using Flutter's performance tools to identify any bottlenecks.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate and use the `tdk_bouncingwidget` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of TDK Bouncing Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tdk_bouncingwidget/tdk_bouncingwidget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'TDK Bouncing Widget Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bouncing Widget Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: BouncingWidget(
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 150), // Duration of the bounce effect
            scaleFactor: 1.5, // Scale factor for the bounce
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on press
              print("Bouncing button pressed!");
            },
            child: Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Text(
                "Bounce Me!",
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we use the BouncingWidget to wrap a Container.
// 5. The BouncingWidget takes a duration and scale factor for the bounce effect.
// 6. When the Container is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback, printing a message to the console.
// 7. The Container displays a blue background with the text "Bounce Me!" in white.
```
