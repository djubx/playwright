// This is the main file of the Flutter application.
// It demonstrates the usage of the `json_convert` package.
// The application has two buttons: "Convert JSON to Dart" and "Convert Dart to JSON".
// When the user clicks on the "Convert JSON to Dart" button, the application converts the JSON data to a Dart object.
// When the user clicks on the "Convert Dart to JSON" button, the application converts the Dart object to JSON data.

// The application uses the `JsonConvert.fromJson` method to convert JSON data to a Dart object.
// It uses the `JsonConvert.toJson` method to convert a Dart object to JSON data.

// The application also demonstrates the customization of conversion options.
// It uses the `JsonConvertOptions` object to ignore null values during the conversion process.

// The application works on both Android and iOS platforms.
// However, on Android, it requires the addition of a line to the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
