# Overview of the `select_dialog` Flutter Package

The `select_dialog` package is a versatile Flutter library designed to simplify the process of creating selection dialogs in your mobile applications. This package provides a straightforward way to implement dialogs that allow users to select from a list of options, making it ideal for scenarios where you need to present a list of items for selection, such as choosing a country, selecting a category, or picking a date.

## When to Use `select_dialog`

- **User Input**: When you need to gather user input from a predefined list.
- **Data Filtering**: To filter and select data from a large dataset.
- **Form Filling**: Useful in forms where users need to select options like gender, country, or state.

## Features

- **Customizable UI**: Easily customize the appearance of the dialog to match your app's theme.
- **Search Functionality**: Built-in search feature to quickly find items in large lists.
- **Async Data Loading**: Supports asynchronous data loading, making it suitable for dynamic data sources.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Setting Up and Using the `select_dialog` Package

In this section, we'll walk through the setup process for the `select_dialog` package and demonstrate how to integrate it into your Flutter project.

## Installation

To use the `select_dialog` package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  select_dialog: ^2.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Basic Usage

### Step 1: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `select_dialog` package:

```dart
import 'package:select_dialog/select_dialog.dart';
```

### Step 2: Implement the Dialog

To display a selection dialog, use the `SelectDialog.showModal` method. Here's a basic example:

```dart
SelectDialog.showModal<String>(
  context,
  label: "Select an option",
  items: ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"],
  onChange: (String selected) {
    print("Selected: $selected");
  },
);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

No additional configuration is required for Android. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 16 in `android/app/build.gradle`.

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure your deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Optimizations

- **Custom Item Builder**: Use the `itemBuilder` parameter to customize how each item is displayed.
- **Async Items**: Use the `onFind` parameter to load items asynchronously, which is useful for fetching data from a server.

# Complete Example of Using `select_dialog`

Below is a complete Flutter application demonstrating the key features of the `select_dialog` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:select_dialog/select_dialog.dart';

void main() => runApp(RealFlutter());

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Select Dialog Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  String selectedValue = "None";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Select Dialog Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Selected: $selectedValue',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Show the select dialog when the button is pressed
                SelectDialog.showModal<String>(
                  context,
                  label: "Select an option",
                  items: ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"],
                  onChange: (String selected) {
                    // Update the selected value when an option is chosen
                    setState(() {
                      selectedValue = selected;
                    });
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Open Select Dialog'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` app.
// `RealFlutter` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a home page.
// The `HomePage` is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the selected value.
// The UI consists of a text widget displaying the selected value and a button to open the dialog.
// When the button is pressed, `SelectDialog.showModal` is called to display the dialog.
// The dialog presents a list of options, and when an option is selected, the state is updated to reflect the choice.
