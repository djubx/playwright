# Rubber Flutter Package: A High-Level Overview
=====================================================

The Rubber Flutter package is a popular library for creating flexible and customizable bottom sheets in Flutter applications. It provides a simple and intuitive API for creating bottom sheets that can be used to display additional content, such as menus, settings, or other interactive elements.

### When to Use Rubber

Rubber is particularly useful when you need to create a bottom sheet that can be customized to fit your app's design and branding. It provides a range of features, including:

* Customizable height and width
* Support for different animation types
* Ability to add custom content, such as widgets or images
* Support for different gestures, such as tapping or swiping

### Features

Some of the key features of the Rubber package include:

* **Customizable height and width**: Rubber allows you to set the height and width of the bottom sheet to fit your needs.
* **Animation types**: Rubber provides several animation types, including fade, slide, and scale.
* **Custom content**: Rubber allows you to add custom content, such as widgets or images, to the bottom sheet.

# Setting Up and Using Rubber
=============================

To use Rubber in your Flutter app, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Rubber Package to Your Pubspec File

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rubber: ^1.0.0
```
### Step 2: Import the Rubber Package

Import the Rubber package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:rubber/rubber.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create a RubberBottomSheet

Create a `RubberBottomSheet` widget and pass in the required properties:
```dart
RubberBottomSheet(
  height: 200,
  width: double.infinity,
  animationType: RubberAnimationType.fade,
  child: Container(
    color: Colors.white,
    child: Center(
      child: Text('Hello, World!'),
    ),
  ),
)
```
### Platform-Specific Details

Rubber works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details to keep in mind:

* On Android, Rubber uses the `BottomSheet` widget from the Android SDK.
* On iOS, Rubber uses a custom implementation to mimic the behavior of a bottom sheet.

### Configurations and Optimizations

Rubber provides several configurations and optimizations to customize its behavior. For example, you can set the ` animationDuration` property to control the animation speed.

          },
          child: Text('Show Rubber Bottom Sheet'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by creating a Material app with a home page.
// The home page is a stateful widget that contains a button.
// When the button is pressed, a RubberBottomSheet is created and shown.
// The RubberBottomSheet has a height of 200, a width of infinity, and uses a fade animation.
// The child of the RubberBottomSheet is a container with a white background and a centered text.
// The text says 'Hello, World!'.
