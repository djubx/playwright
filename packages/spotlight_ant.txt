# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Spotlight Ant

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `spotlight_ant` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  spotlight_ant: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:spotlight_ant/spotlight_ant.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if your spotlight effect interacts with device features. However, for basic usage, no additional configuration is required.

## Step 4: Using the Package
To use the spotlight effect, wrap your widget with the `Spotlight` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
Spotlight(
  target: yourTargetWidget, // The widget you want to highlight
  radius: 100.0, // Radius of the spotlight
  color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5), // Color of the overlay
  child: YourMainWidget(), // The main content of your app
)
```

This setup will create a spotlight effect around `yourTargetWidget`, dimming the rest of the screen.

# Complete Example of Spotlight Ant

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:spotlight_ant/spotlight_ant.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Spotlight Ant Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Spotlight Ant Demo'),
        ),
        body: SpotlightDemo(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SpotlightDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SpotlightDemoState createState() => _SpotlightDemoState();
}

class _SpotlightDemoState extends State<SpotlightDemo> {
  // State variable to control the spotlight visibility
  bool _isSpotlightVisible = true;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Stack(
      children: [
        // Main content of the app
        Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Toggle spotlight visibility
              setState(() {
                _isSpotlightVisible = !_isSpotlightVisible;
              });
            },
            child: Text('Toggle Spotlight'),
          ),
        ),
        // Spotlight effect
        if (_isSpotlightVisible)
          Spotlight(
            target: Positioned(
              top: 200,
              left: 150,
              child: Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: Colors.red,
                child: Center(child: Text('Spotlight Target')),
              ),
            ),
            radius: 100.0,
            color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5),
            child: Container(), // Empty container to allow spotlight effect
          ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the SpotlightDemo widget.
// 3. SpotlightDemo is a StatefulWidget that manages the visibility of the spotlight effect.
// 4. The build method of SpotlightDemo creates a Stack widget containing a button and the Spotlight effect.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the state variable _isSpotlightVisible toggles, showing or hiding the spotlight.
// 6. If _isSpotlightVisible is true, the Spotlight widget is displayed, highlighting the target widget (a red square).
// 7. The spotlight dims the rest of the screen, focusing the user's attention on the target widget.
```
