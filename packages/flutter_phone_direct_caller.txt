# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_phone_direct_caller

## Step 1: Adding Dependency
To use the `flutter_phone_direct_caller` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_phone_direct_caller: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, you need to ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to make phone calls. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/` and add the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CALL_PHONE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add a usage description in your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/`. Add the following key-value pair:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to contacts to make calls directly.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to initiate a call:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_phone_direct_caller/flutter_phone_direct_caller.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Direct Caller Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Replace with the phone number you want to call
              String phoneNumber = "1234567890"; 
              await FlutterPhoneDirectCaller.callNumber(phoneNumber);
            },
            child: Text('Call Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the user taps the "Call Now" button, the app will directly initiate a call to the specified phone number.

# Complete Example of flutter_phone_direct_caller

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_phone_direct_caller/flutter_phone_direct_caller.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Direct Caller Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the phone number to call
              String phoneNumber = "1234567890"; 
              // Call the number directly
              await FlutterPhoneDirectCaller.callNumber(phoneNumber);
            },
            child: Text('Call Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Direct Caller Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created with the text 'Call Now'.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 7. Inside the callback, the phone number is defined as a string.
// 8. The FlutterPhoneDirectCaller.callNumber method is called with the phone number.
// 9. This initiates a call to the specified number directly without user confirmation.
