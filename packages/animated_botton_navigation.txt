# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `animated_bottom_navigation`

## Installation
To get started with the `animated_bottom_navigation` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  animated_bottom_navigation: ^0.0.1 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `animated_bottom_navigation` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:animated_bottom_navigation/animated_bottom_navigation.dart';
```

You can then create a simple bottom navigation bar by using the `AnimatedBottomNavigation` widget. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_bottom_navigation/animated_bottom_navigation.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Bottom Navigation')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Current Index: $_currentIndex')),
      bottomNavigationBar: AnimatedBottomNavigation(
        icons: [Icons.home, Icons.search, Icons.notifications, Icons.person],
        activeIndex: _currentIndex,
        onTap: (index) {
          setState(() {
            _currentIndex = index;
          });
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with an animated bottom navigation bar. The `onTap` callback updates the current index, which changes the displayed text in the center of the screen.

With this setup, you can easily create a visually appealing navigation experience in your Flutter app.

# Complete Example of `animated_bottom_navigation`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_bottom_navigation/animated_bottom_navigation.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to keep track of the currently selected index
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  // List of icons for the bottom navigation bar
  final List<IconData> _icons = [
    Icons.home,
    Icons.search,
    Icons.notifications,
    Icons.person,
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Bottom Navigation')),
      // Display the current index in the center of the screen
      body: Center(child: Text('Current Index: $_currentIndex')),
      bottomNavigationBar: AnimatedBottomNavigation(
        // Pass the list of icons to the navigation bar
        icons: _icons,
        // Set the active index to the current index
        activeIndex: _currentIndex,
        // Define the onTap callback to handle index changes
        onTap: (index) {
          // Update the state with the new index
          setState(() {
            _currentIndex = index;
          });
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts here
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(),
  ));
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
2. The `RealFlutter` widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current index of the selected navigation item.
3. The `_currentIndex` variable is initialized to 0, representing the first item in the navigation bar.
4. The `build` method constructs the UI, including an AppBar and a Center widget that displays the current index.
5. The `AnimatedBottomNavigation` widget is used to create the bottom navigation bar, passing the list of icons and the current index.
6. When a user taps on an icon, the `onTap` callback is triggered, updating the `_currentIndex` and causing the UI to rebuild with the new index.
7. The displayed text in the center of the screen updates to reflect the currently selected index.
