# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Resizable Widget Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `resizable_widget` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  resizable_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Resizable Widget

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a resizable widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:resizable_widget/resizable_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Resizable Widget Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ResizableWidget(
            minWidth: 100,
            minHeight: 100,
            maxWidth: 400,
            maxHeight: 400,
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(child: Text('Resize Me!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple resizable container that users can adjust. The `ResizableWidget` takes parameters for minimum and maximum width and height, ensuring that the widget does not become too small or too large.

# Complete Example of the Resizable Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:resizable_widget/resizable_widget.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Resizable Widget Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the resizable widget in the body
          child: ResizableWidget(
            minWidth: 100, // Minimum width of the widget
            minHeight: 100, // Minimum height of the widget
            maxWidth: 400, // Maximum width of the widget
            maxHeight: 400, // Maximum height of the widget
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the widget
              child: Center(
                // Centering the text inside the container
                child: Text(
                  'Resize Me!', // Text displayed in the widget
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white), // Text color
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter application
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, a ResizableWidget is created, allowing users to resize it within specified limits.
4. The ResizableWidget contains a Container with a blue background and centered text that instructs users to resize it.
5. Users can interact with the widget by dragging its edges or corners to resize it dynamically.
6. The widget's size is constrained by the minWidth, minHeight, maxWidth, and maxHeight properties, ensuring it remains usable.
