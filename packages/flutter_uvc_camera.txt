# Overview of the `flutter_uvc_camera` Package

The `flutter_uvc_camera` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate camera functionalities into their applications, specifically for UVC (USB Video Class) cameras. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to access external USB cameras, such as in industrial applications, medical devices, or any situation where the built-in camera is insufficient.

## Features

- **UVC Camera Access**: Connect and control USB cameras directly from your Flutter app.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, though with some platform-specific configurations.
- **Real-Time Video Streaming**: Stream video from the camera in real-time.
- **Capture Images and Videos**: Easily capture and save images or videos from the camera feed.
- **Customizable Camera Controls**: Adjust camera settings like resolution, focus, and more.

### When to Use

- **Industrial Applications**: When you need to monitor processes using external cameras.
- **Medical Devices**: For applications requiring high-quality video input from specialized cameras.
- **Security Systems**: Integrate external cameras for surveillance purposes.
- **Educational Tools**: Use external cameras for demonstrations or experiments.

# Setting Up `flutter_uvc_camera`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_uvc_camera` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_uvc_camera: ^0.0.1
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

2. **USB Host Feature**: Ensure your app can communicate with USB devices by adding:

   ```xml
   <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.usb.host" />
   ```

3. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`.

### iOS

1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist`:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the camera for video streaming.</string>
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the microphone for audio recording.</string>
   ```

2. **USB Support**: iOS has limited support for USB cameras, and additional configurations might be necessary depending on the specific use case.

## Using the Package

To use the `flutter_uvc_camera` package, you will typically create a widget that initializes and displays the camera feed. Below, we will provide a complete example.

<-- START_MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_uvc_camera/flutter_uvc_camera.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'UVC Camera Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CameraScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CameraScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CameraScreenState createState() => _CameraScreenState();
}

class _CameraScreenState extends State<CameraScreen> {
  RealFlutter _uvcCameraController;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the UVC camera controller
    _uvcCameraController = RealFlutter();
    _uvcCameraController.initialize().then((_) {
      if (!mounted) return;
      setState(() {});
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is disposed
    _uvcCameraController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    if (!_uvcCameraController.isInitialized) {
      // Display a loading indicator while the camera is initializing
      return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
    }
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('UVC Camera'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: <Widget>[
          // Display the camera preview
          Expanded(
            child: CameraPreview(_uvcCameraController),
          ),
          // Capture button
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.camera),
            onPressed: () async {
              // Capture an image
              final image = await _uvcCameraController.takePicture();
              // Display the captured image
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (_) => AlertDialog(
                  content: Image.file(image),
                ),
              );
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and directs to CameraScreen.
// 3. CameraScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the UVC camera lifecycle.
// 4. In initState, the RealFlutter controller is initialized.
// 5. The build method checks if the camera is initialized and displays a loading indicator if not.
// 6. Once initialized, the camera preview is displayed using CameraPreview.
// 7. An IconButton is provided to capture images, which are then displayed in a dialog.
