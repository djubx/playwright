// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The `RealFlutter` widget is created and run as the main application.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a `MaterialApp` widget with a title and theme.
// 3. The `MaterialApp` widget builds an `IconShadowDemo` widget as its home screen.
// 4. The `IconShadowDemo` widget builds a `Scaffold` widget with an app bar and body.
// 5. The body of the `Scaffold` widget is a `Center` widget containing a `Column` widget.
// 6. The `Column` widget contains three `IconShadow` widgets, each with a different icon and shadow configuration.
// 7. Each `IconShadow` widget builds an icon with a shadow based on its configuration.
// 8. The final UI is displayed on the screen, showing three icons with different shadows.
