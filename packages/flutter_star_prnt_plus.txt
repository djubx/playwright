void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Star Printer Example',
      home: PrinterHome(),
    );
  }
}

class PrinterHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PrinterHomeState createState() => _PrinterHomeState();
}

class _PrinterHomeState extends State<PrinterHome> {
  final StarPrinter printer = StarPrinter();
  String statusMessage = 'Disconnected';

  // Function to connect to the printer
  Future<void> connectToPrinter() async {
    try {
      // Replace with your printer's IP address or Bluetooth address
      await printer.connect('printer_ip_or_bluetooth_address');
      setState(() {

    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {

      });
    }
  }

  // Function to print a sample receipt
  Future<void> printReceipt() async {
    try {
      await printer.printText('Receipt Title', styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center));
      await printer.printText('Item 1: \$10.00', styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.left));
      await printer.printText('Item 2: \$15.00', styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.left));
      await printer.printText('Total: \$25.00', styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.right));
      await printer.printNewLine();
      await printer.printText('Thank you for your purchase!', styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center));
      await printer.printNewLine();
      await printer.disconnect();
      setState(() {
        statusMessage = 'Printed Successfully';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        statusMessage = 'Failed to print: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Star Printer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(statusMessage),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: connectToPrinter,
              child: Text('Connect to Printer'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: printReceipt,
              child: Text('Print Receipt'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (PrinterHome).
// 3. PrinterHome is a stateful widget that manages the connection and printing process.
// 4. The connectToPrinter function attempts to connect to the specified printer.
// 5. The printReceipt function sends print commands to the printer, formatting the receipt.
// 6. The status message updates based on the connection and printing success or failure.
// 7. The UI consists of buttons to connect to the printer and print a receipt, along with a status message.
