# Tutorial: Setting Up the Podcast Search Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `podcast_search` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `podcast_search` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  podcast_search: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file to allow internet access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple UI to search for podcasts. Below is a basic example of how to implement the search functionality.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:podcast_search/podcast_search.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<Podcast> _podcasts = [];
  final TextEditingController _searchController = TextEditingController();

  void _searchPodcasts() async {
    final results = await PodcastSearch.search(_searchController.text);
    setState(() {
      _podcasts = results;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Podcast Search')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          TextField(
            controller: _searchController,
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Search Podcasts',
              suffixIcon: IconButton(
                icon: Icon(Icons.search),
                onPressed: _searchPodcasts,
              ),
            ),
          ),
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: _podcasts.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(_podcasts[index].title),
                  subtitle: Text(_podcasts[index].description),
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple search interface where users can input a search term and view a list of podcasts based on their query.

# Complete Example of Podcast Search

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:podcast_search/podcast_search.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List to hold the podcasts retrieved from the search
  List<Podcast> _podcasts = [];
  // Controller for the search input field
  final TextEditingController _searchController = TextEditingController();

  // Function to search for podcasts based on user input
  void _searchPodcasts() async {
    // Call the search method from the podcast_search package
    final results = await PodcastSearch.search(_searchController.text);
    // Update the state with the retrieved podcasts
    setState(() {
      _podcasts = results;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Podcast Search')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // TextField for user input
          TextField(
            controller: _searchController,
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Search Podcasts',
              suffixIcon: IconButton(
                icon: Icon(Icons.search),
                onPressed: _searchPodcasts, // Trigger search on button press
              ),
            ),
          ),
          // Expanded widget to display the list of podcasts
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: _podcasts.length, // Number of podcasts to display
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(_podcasts[index].title), // Podcast title
                  subtitle: Text(_podcasts[index].description), // Podcast description
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the RealFlutter widget
// The user can enter a search term in the TextField
// When the search button is pressed, _searchPodcasts is called
// This function retrieves podcasts matching the search term
// The results are stored in the _podcasts list and displayed in a ListView
// Each ListTile shows the title and description of the podcast
```

In this complete example, we have created a simple Flutter application that allows users to search for podcasts. The application consists of a `TextField` for input and a `ListView` to display the search results. 

### Application Flow Explanation

- The app starts with the `RealFlutter` widget, which contains a `TextField` for user input and a `ListView` to display the results.
- When the user enters a search term and presses the search button, the `_searchPodcasts` function is triggered.
- This function calls the `PodcastSearch.search` method, passing the user's input as a parameter.
- The results are then stored in the `_podcasts` list, and the UI is updated to display the titles and descriptions of the podcasts in the `ListView`.
- Each podcast is represented as a `ListTile`, making it easy for users to browse through the search results.

This example demonstrates the core functionality of the `podcast_search` package and provides a solid foundation for building more complex podcast-related features in your Flutter applications.
