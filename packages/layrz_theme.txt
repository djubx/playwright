# Setting Up and Using layrz_theme

## Installation

To get started with `layrz_theme`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  layrz_theme: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/layrz_theme).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain capabilities in your `Info.plist` if you are using specific features of the package. However, basic theming does not require additional configurations.

## Basic Usage

To use `layrz_theme`, you need to wrap your application with the `ThemeProvider` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:layrz_theme/layrz_theme.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ThemeProvider(
      theme: MyCustomTheme(), // Define your custom theme here
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: RealFlutter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, `MyCustomTheme` would be a class where you define your theme properties.

# Complete Example of layrz_theme in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:layrz_theme/layrz_theme.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ThemeProvider(
      theme: MyCustomTheme(), // Use your custom theme
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Layrz Theme Example',
        home: RealFlutter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Define your custom theme class
class MyCustomTheme extends Theme {
  MyCustomTheme()
      : super(
          primaryColor: Colors.blue,
          accentColor: Colors.amber,
          textTheme: TextTheme(
            bodyText1: TextStyle(color: Colors.black),
            bodyText2: TextStyle(color: Colors.grey),
          ),
        );
}

// Main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Layrz Theme Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Hello, Layrz Theme!',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.bodyText1,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Logic to switch themes can be added here
              },
              child: Text('Switch Theme'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that wraps the MaterialApp with ThemeProvider.
// 3. ThemeProvider takes a custom theme (MyCustomTheme) that defines primary and accent colors, as well as text styles.
// 4. The RealFlutter widget is the home screen, which contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Text widget displays a greeting message styled with the theme's bodyText1 style.
// 6. An ElevatedButton is provided to switch themes, where the logic can be implemented later.
```

```

### Summary of Application Flow
The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `MyApp` widget. The `MyApp` widget sets up the `ThemeProvider` with a custom theme and wraps the `MaterialApp`. The `RealFlutter` widget serves as the main screen, displaying a greeting message and a button to switch themes. The theme can be dynamically changed by implementing the logic in the button's `onPressed` callback. This structure allows for a clean and maintainable theming solution in Flutter applications.
