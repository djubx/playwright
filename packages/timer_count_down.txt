# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Timer Count Down

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `timer_count_down` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  timer_count_down: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:timer_count_down/timer_count_down.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Timer
You can now use the `CountDown` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
CountDown(
  duration: Duration(seconds: 10),
  onFinish: () {
    print('Timer finished!');
  },
  onTick: (remaining) {
    print('Time remaining: $remaining seconds');
  },
  builder: (context, remaining) {
    return Text('$remaining seconds remaining');
  },
);
```

This code snippet creates a countdown timer that lasts for 10 seconds, printing the remaining time to the console and displaying it in a `Text` widget.

# Complete Example of Timer Count Down

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timer_count_down/timer_count_down.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Timer Count Down Example',
      home: TimerPage(),
    );
  }
}

class TimerPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Timer Count Down Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CountDown(
          // Set the duration of the countdown
          duration: Duration(seconds: 10),
          // Callback when the countdown finishes
          onFinish: () {
            // Display a message when the timer finishes
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Timer finished!')),
            );
          },
          // Callback for each tick of the countdown
          onTick: (remaining) {
            // Print the remaining time to the console
            print('Time remaining: $remaining seconds');
          },
          // Builder to display the remaining time
          builder: (context, remaining) {
            // Return a Text widget showing the remaining time
            return Text(
              '$remaining seconds remaining',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (TimerPage).
// 3. TimerPage contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a CountDown widget is created.
// 5. The CountDown widget is configured with a duration of 10 seconds.
// 6. onFinish callback shows a SnackBar when the timer finishes.
// 7. onTick callback prints the remaining time to the console.
// 8. The builder function updates the UI to show the remaining time in a Text widget.
