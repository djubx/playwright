# SVG Path Parser Flutter Package

The `svg_path_parser` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for the parsing and rendering of SVG path data. This package is particularly useful when you want to create complex shapes and animations without relying on bitmap images. Instead, you can define your graphics using SVG path data, which is resolution-independent and can be easily manipulated.

## When to Use

You should consider using the `svg_path_parser` package in scenarios such as:
- Creating custom shapes and icons that need to scale without losing quality.
- Animating vector graphics in your Flutter applications.
- Rendering SVG data fetched from APIs or local assets.

## Features

- **Path Parsing**: Converts SVG path data into Flutter's `Path` objects.
- **Custom Shapes**: Easily create and manipulate complex shapes.
- **Animation Support**: Integrate with Flutter's animation framework to animate paths.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

With these features, the `svg_path_parser` package empowers developers to create visually appealing applications with high-quality graphics.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using svg_path_parser

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `svg_path_parser` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  svg_path_parser: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Podfile` and ensure that the platform is set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to parse and render an SVG path.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:svg_path_parser/svg_path_parser.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that uses the `svg_path_parser` to render a path:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define your SVG path data
    String svgPathData = "M 10 10 H 90 V 90 H 10 L 10 10";

    // Parse the SVG path data into a Path object
    Path path = parseSvgPath(svgPathData);

    return CustomPaint(
      size: Size(100, 100),
      painter: PathPainter(path),
    );
  }
}

class PathPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final Path path;

  PathPainter(this.path);

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Set the paint style
    Paint paint = Paint()
      ..color = Colors.blue
      ..style = PaintingStyle.fill;

    // Draw the path on the canvas
    canvas.drawPath(path, paint);
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to parse SVG path data and render it using Flutter's `CustomPainter`.

# Complete Example of Using svg_path_parser

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:svg_path_parser/svg_path_parser.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SVG Path Parser Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('SVG Path Parser Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RealFlutter(), // Our main widget that uses svg_path_parser
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define your SVG path data
    String svgPathData = "M 10 10 H 90 V 90 H 10 L 10 10";

    // Parse the SVG path data into a Path object
    Path path = parseSvgPath(svgPathData);

    return CustomPaint(
      size: Size(100, 100), // Set the size of the CustomPaint widget
      painter: PathPainter(path), // Use our custom painter to draw the path
    );
  }
}

class PathPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final Path path;

  PathPainter(this.path);

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Set the paint style
    Paint paint = Paint()
      ..color = Colors.blue // Set the color of the path
      ..style = PaintingStyle.fill; // Fill the path

    // Draw the path on the canvas
    canvas.drawPath(path, paint);
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false; // No need to repaint if the path hasn't changed
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp().
// 2. MyApp is the root widget that sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget is created, which contains the SVG path data.
// 4. The SVG path data is parsed into a Path object using the parseSvgPath function.
// 5. A CustomPaint widget is used to draw the path on the screen.
// 6. The PathPainter class is responsible for rendering the path on the canvas.
// 7. The paint method of PathPainter is called to draw the path with the specified paint style.
