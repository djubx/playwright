# Complete Example of fluttering_phrases

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fluttering_phrases/fluttering_phrases.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fluttering Phrases Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: PhrasesHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class PhrasesHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PhrasesHomePageState createState() => _PhrasesHomePageState();
}

class _PhrasesHomePageState extends State<PhrasesHomePage> {
  // Create an instance of RealFlutter to manage phrases
  final RealFlutter phrases = RealFlutter();
  String currentPhrase = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch the first random phrase when the app starts
    currentPhrase = phrases.getRandomPhrase();
  }

  void _getNewPhrase() {
    // Update the state with a new random phrase
    setState(() {
      currentPhrase = phrases.getRandomPhrase();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Fluttering Phrases'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the current phrase
            Text(
              currentPhrase,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontStyle: FontStyle.italic),
              textAlign: TextAlign.center,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to fetch a new phrase
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _getNewPhrase,
              child: Text('Get New Phrase'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets PhrasesHomePage as the home.
// 3. PhrasesHomePage is a stateful widget that manages the current phrase.
// 4. In initState, a random phrase is fetched and stored in currentPhrase.
// 5. The build method displays the current phrase and a button to fetch a new one.
// 6. When the button is pressed, _getNewPhrase is called, which updates the currentPhrase with a new random phrase and rebuilds the UI.
