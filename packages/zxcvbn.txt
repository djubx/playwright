# zxcvbn Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Guide

## <-- START_DESCRIPTION -->

### Description

The **zxcvbn** package is a powerful password strength estimator for Flutter applications. It is based on the popular zxcvbn library, which analyzes passwords and provides feedback on their strength. This package is particularly useful for applications that require user authentication, as it helps ensure that users create strong, secure passwords.

### When to Use

You should consider using the zxcvbn package in scenarios such as:
- User registration forms where password strength needs to be validated.
- Applications that require secure user authentication.
- Any app that aims to enhance security by encouraging users to create strong passwords.

### Features

- **Password Strength Estimation**: Provides a score based on the complexity of the password.
- **Feedback Generation**: Offers suggestions to improve password strength.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to tweak the scoring algorithm to fit specific needs.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to add to any Flutter project with minimal setup.

### Tutorial

#### Installation

To add the zxcvbn package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  zxcvbn: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

#### Platform-Specific Details

The zxcvbn package is platform-agnostic, meaning it works seamlessly on both Android and iOS without any additional configuration. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

#### Usage

To use the zxcvbn package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:zxcvbn/zxcvbn.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `Zxcvbn` class and use its methods to evaluate password strength.

### Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zxcvbn/zxcvbn.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Password Strength Checker',
      home: PasswordStrengthChecker(),
    );
  }
}

class PasswordStrengthChecker extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PasswordStrengthCheckerState createState() => _PasswordStrengthCheckerState();
}

class _PasswordStrengthCheckerState extends State<PasswordStrengthChecker> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  String _passwordStrength = '';
  int _score = 0;

  void _checkPasswordStrength(String password) {
    // Create an instance of Zxcvbn
    final result = Zxcvbn().passwordStrength(password);
    
    // Update the score and feedback based on the result
    setState(() {
      _score = result['score'];
      _passwordStrength = result['feedback'].map((f) => f['text']).join(', ');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Password Strength Checker'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _controller,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter Password',
              ),
              obscureText: true,
              onChanged: _checkPasswordStrength, // Check strength on input change
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              'Password Strength: ${_score == 0 ? 'Too Weak' : _score == 1 ? 'Weak' : _score == 2 ? 'Fair' : _score == 3 ? 'Good' : 'Strong'}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            Text(
              'Suggestions: $_passwordStrength',
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.red),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// The PasswordStrengthChecker widget is a stateful widget that manages the password input and its strength evaluation.
// Inside the PasswordStrengthChecker, a TextEditingController is used to capture the password input.
// The _checkPasswordStrength method is called whenever the user types in the password field.
// This method uses the Zxcvbn class to evaluate the password and updates the score and feedback accordingly.
// The UI displays the password strength and suggestions based on the evaluation.
```

### Summary of Application Flow

The application begins by running the `RealFlutter` widget, which initializes a `MaterialApp`. The home screen is set to the `PasswordStrengthChecker` widget. This widget contains a `TextField` for password input, which triggers the `_checkPasswordStrength` method on every change. This method utilizes the zxcvbn package to assess the password's strength and updates the UI with the strength score and suggestions for improvement. The user receives real-time feedback, enhancing the overall security of their password choices.
