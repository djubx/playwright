# Migrant Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **Migrant** Flutter package is designed to facilitate the management of user data migration across different platforms and versions of applications. It is particularly useful for developers who need to ensure that user data is seamlessly transferred when updating an app or switching between different environments. 

## When to Use Migrant
- **Data Migration**: When you need to migrate user data from one version of your app to another.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: To maintain data consistency across iOS and Android platforms.
- **User Experience**: To enhance user experience by ensuring that users do not lose their data during updates.

## Key Features
- **Automatic Data Migration**: Automatically handles the migration of user data without requiring manual intervention.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Version Control**: Keeps track of different versions of data schemas, allowing for smooth transitions.
- **Custom Migration Logic**: Allows developers to define custom migration logic as per their requirements.

The Migrant package is a powerful tool for any Flutter developer looking to manage user data effectively during app updates or migrations.

# Migrant Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Migrant package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  migrant: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for data storage. You may need to add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` to handle data storage permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save data.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for data capture.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the Migrant package, you will typically follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Migrant**: Set up the Migrant instance in your app.
2. **Define Migration Logic**: Specify how data should be migrated.
3. **Execute Migration**: Call the migration function when needed.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up and use the Migrant package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:migrant/migrant.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Migrant Example',
      home: MigrationScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class MigrationScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MigrationScreenState createState() => _MigrationScreenState();
}

class _MigrationScreenState extends State<MigrationScreen> {
  final Migrant migrant = Migrant();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Migrant instance
    migrant.initialize();
  }

  void migrateData() {
    // Define your migration logic here
    migrant.migrate((oldData) {
      // Custom migration logic
      return newData; // Return the new data
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Migrant Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: migrateData,
          child: Text('Migrate Data'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we set up a simple Flutter application that initializes the Migrant package and provides a button to trigger data migration.

# Complete Example of Migrant Package in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:migrant/migrant.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Migrant Example',
      home: MigrationScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class MigrationScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MigrationScreenState createState() => _MigrationScreenState();
}

class _MigrationScreenState extends State<MigrationScreen> {
  final Migrant migrant = Migrant(); // Create an instance of Migrant

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Migrant instance
    migrant.initialize();
  }

  void migrateData() {
    // Define your migration logic here
    migrant.migrate((oldData) {
      // Custom migration logic
      // Here you can transform oldData to newData
      var newData = oldData; // For example, just returning oldData
      return newData; // Return the new data
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Migrant Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: migrateData, // Trigger data migration on button press
          child: Text('Migrate Data'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (MigrationScreen).
// 3. MigrationScreen is a stateful widget that creates an instance of Migrant.
// 4. In the initState method, the Migrant instance is initialized.
// 5. The migrateData method defines the logic for migrating data.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the migrateData method is called, executing the migration logic.
// 7. The migration logic can transform old data into new data as needed.
