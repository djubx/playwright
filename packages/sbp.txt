# SBP Flutter Package Overview
The SBP (Swift Binary Protocol) Flutter package is a lightweight, efficient, and easy-to-use library for building cross-platform applications that require binary data communication. It provides a simple and unified API for encoding and decoding binary data, making it an ideal choice for applications that require low-level data manipulation.

## Key Features

*   **Efficient Binary Data Handling**: The SBP package provides an efficient way to handle binary data, allowing for fast and reliable data transfer between devices.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The package is designed to work seamlessly across multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, and desktop environments.
*   **Simple and Unified API**: The SBP package offers a simple and unified API for encoding and decoding binary data, making it easy to use and integrate into existing applications.

## When to Use SBP

The SBP package is particularly useful in scenarios where binary data needs to be transmitted or received, such as:

*   **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Communication**: The SBP package can be used to handle binary data communication between devices using BLE technology.
*   **Network Communication**: The package can be used to send and receive binary data over a network, making it suitable for applications that require low-level data manipulation.
*   **Embedded Systems**: The SBP package can be used in embedded systems where binary data needs to be handled efficiently and reliably.

# SBP Flutter Package Tutorial
This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up and using the SBP Flutter package in your application.

## Step 1: Add the SBP Package to Your Project

To add the SBP package to your project, simply add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  sbp: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Import the SBP Package

To use the SBP package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:sbp/sbp.dart';
```

## Step 3: Initialize the SBP Package

To initialize the SBP package, create an instance of the `SBP` class:

```dart
SBP sbp = SBP();
```

## Step 4: Use the SBP Package

To use the SBP package, you can call the `encode` and `decode` methods to handle binary data:

```dart
// Encode binary data
List<int> encodedData = sbp.encode('Hello, World!');

// Decode binary data
String decodedData = sbp.decode(encodedData);
```

```dart
// Import the SBP package
import 'package:sbp/sbp.dart';

// Import the Flutter framework
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Create a new Flutter application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Create a new stateless widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an instance of the SBP class
    SBP sbp = SBP();

    // Encode binary data
    List<int> encodedData = sbp.encode('Hello, World!');

    // Decode binary data
    String decodedData = sbp.decode(encodedData);

    // Return a new Scaffold widget
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SBP Flutter Package Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Encoded Data: $encodedData'),
            Text('Decoded Data: $decodedData'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application.
// 2. The application creates an instance of the SBP class.
// 3. The application encodes binary data using the SBP class.
// 4. The application decodes the binary data using the SBP class.
// 5. The application displays the encoded and decoded data on the screen.

// In summary, this code demonstrates how to use the SBP package to encode and decode binary data in a Flutter application.
