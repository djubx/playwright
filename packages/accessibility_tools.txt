# Accessibility Tools Flutter Package

The `accessibility_tools` Flutter package is designed to enhance the accessibility of Flutter applications, making them more usable for individuals with disabilities. This package provides a set of tools and widgets that help developers implement accessibility features seamlessly.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `accessibility_tools` package when:
- You want to ensure your app is usable by people with visual, auditory, or motor impairments.

- You want to improve the overall user experience by making your app more inclusive.

## Key Features

- **Screen Reader Support**: Provides support for screen readers, allowing visually impaired users to navigate your app.
- **Customizable Accessibility Labels**: Allows developers to set custom labels for widgets, improving the context for screen readers.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Accessibility Tools

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `accessibility_tools` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  accessibility_tools: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Add the following inside the `<application>` tag to enable accessibility services:

```xml
<application
    ...
    android:label="Your App Name"
    android:usesCleartextTraffic="true">
    <meta-data
        android:name="android.app.accessibility_service"
        android:resource="@xml/accessibility_service_config" />
</application>
```

4. Create a new XML file in `android/app/src/main/res/xml/accessibility_service_config.xml`:

```xml
<accessibility-service
    android:description="@string/accessibility_service_description"
    android:accessibilityEventTypes="typeAllMask"
    android:packageNames="com.yourapp.package"
    android:accessibilityFeedbackType="feedbackSpoken"
    android:notificationTimeout="100"
    android:canRetrieveWindowContent="true"
    android:settingsActivity="com.yourapp.package.YourSettingsActivity"/>
```

### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to enable accessibility features:

```xml
<key>UIAccessibilityCustomActions</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>name</key>
        <string>Your Custom Action</string>
        <key>target</key>
        <string>yourTargetMethod</string>
    </dict>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

You can now use the package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement accessibility features in your app.

# Complete Example of Accessibility Tools

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:accessibility_tools/accessibility_tools.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Accessibility Tools Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Accessibility Tools Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // A button with an accessibility label
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action for the button
              },
              child: Text('Click Me'),
              // Setting an accessibility label for screen readers
              semanticsLabel: 'Click this button to perform an action',
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // A text widget with a custom accessibility label
            Text(
              'This is an example of accessibility tools in Flutter.',
              // Custom accessibility label for screen readers
              semanticsLabel: 'Example text for accessibility tools',
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the button and text vertically.
// 5. The ElevatedButton has an onPressed callback for actions and a semanticsLabel for screen readers.
// 6. The Text widget also has a semanticsLabel to provide context for screen readers.
```
