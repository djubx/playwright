# Custom Button Builder Flutter Package

The **custom_button_builder** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the creation of customizable buttons in Flutter applications. It allows developers to create buttons with various styles, shapes, and animations without having to write extensive boilerplate code. This package is particularly useful when you want to maintain a consistent design language across your app while also providing flexibility in button customization.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the **custom_button_builder** package in scenarios such as:
- When you need to create multiple buttons with similar styles but different functionalities.
- If you want to implement a design system that requires consistent button styles across various screens.
- When you want to enhance user experience with animated buttons that provide visual feedback.

## Features

- **Customizable Styles**: Easily change colors, shapes, and sizes of buttons.
- **Animations**: Built-in support for animations to enhance user interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: Buttons that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Accessibility**: Options to improve accessibility features for users with disabilities.

With these features, the **custom_button_builder** package streamlines the button creation process, allowing developers to focus on building their applications rather than worrying about UI consistency.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Custom Button Builder

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **custom_button_builder** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  custom_button_builder: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a custom button using the **custom_button_builder** package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_button_builder/custom_button_builder.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom Button Builder Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when button is pressed
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            text: 'Click Me',
            color: Colors.blue,
            shape: BoxShape.rectangle,
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
            elevation: 5,
            animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a custom button that prints a message to the console when pressed.

# Complete Example of Custom Button Builder

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_button_builder/custom_button_builder.dart';

// Main class of the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom Button Builder Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when button is pressed
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            text: 'Click Me',
            color: Colors.blue, // Set the button color
            shape: BoxShape.rectangle, // Set the button shape
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10), // Set the border radius
            elevation: 5, // Set the elevation for shadow effect
            animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 300), // Set animation duration
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class is instantiated, which builds the MaterialApp widget.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a CustomButton is created.
// 5. The CustomButton has an onPressed callback that prints 'Button Pressed!' to the console when clicked.
// 6. The button is styled with a blue color, rectangular shape, rounded corners, elevation for shadow, and an animation duration for visual feedback.
```
