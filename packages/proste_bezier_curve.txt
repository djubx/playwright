# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Proste Bezier Curve

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **proste_bezier_curve** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  proste_bezier_curve: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a Bezier curve using the **proste_bezier_curve** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:proste_bezier_curve/proste_bezier_curve.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Proste Bezier Curve Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomPaint(
            size: Size(300, 300),
            painter: BezierCurvePainter(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class BezierCurvePainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Define the paint for the curve
    Paint paint = Paint()
      ..color = Colors.blue
      ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke
      ..strokeWidth = 4.0;

    // Define the control points for the Bezier curve
    Offset startPoint = Offset(50, size.height - 50);
    Offset controlPoint1 = Offset(size.width / 2, 0);
    Offset controlPoint2 = Offset(size.width / 2, size.height);
    Offset endPoint = Offset(size.width - 50, size.height - 50);

    // Draw the Bezier curve
    canvas.drawBezier(
      startPoint,
      controlPoint1,
      controlPoint2,
      endPoint,
      paint,
    );
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the **proste_bezier_curve** package to draw a Bezier curve. The `BezierCurvePainter` class extends `CustomPainter` and overrides the `paint` method to define how the curve is drawn.

# Complete Example of Proste Bezier Curve

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:proste_bezier_curve/proste_bezier_curve.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Proste Bezier Curve Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomPaint(
            size: Size(300, 300), // Set the size of the CustomPaint widget
            painter: BezierCurvePainter(), // Use the custom painter to draw the curve
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class BezierCurvePainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Define the paint for the curve
    Paint paint = Paint()
      ..color = Colors.blue // Set the color of the curve
      ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke // Set the style to stroke
      ..strokeWidth = 4.0; // Set the stroke width

    // Define the control points for the Bezier curve
    Offset startPoint = Offset(50, size.height - 50); // Starting point of the curve
    Offset controlPoint1 = Offset(size.width / 2, 0); // First control point
    Offset controlPoint2 = Offset(size.width / 2, size.height); // Second control point
    Offset endPoint = Offset(size.width - 50, size.height - 50); // Ending point of the curve

    // Draw the Bezier curve using the defined points
    canvas.drawBezier(
      startPoint, // Start point
      controlPoint1, // First control point
      controlPoint2, // Second control point
      endPoint, // End point
      paint, // Paint object
    );
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false; // No need to repaint if the delegate hasn't changed
  }
}

// The main function to run the app
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the Flutter application
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The `main` function is the entry point of the application, which calls `runApp` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a CustomPaint widget.
3. The `CustomPaint` widget uses the `BezierCurvePainter` to draw the Bezier curve.
4. In the `BezierCurvePainter`, the `paint` method is overridden to define how the curve is drawn on the canvas.
5. The control points and the start/end points are defined, and the `canvas.drawBezier` method is called to render the curve.
6. The application displays a blue Bezier curve on the screen, demonstrating the use of the proste_bezier_curve package.
