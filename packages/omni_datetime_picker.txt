# Complete Example of Omni DateTime Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:omni_datetime_picker/omni_datetime_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Omni DateTime Picker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DateTimePickerHome(),
    );
  }
}

class DateTimePickerHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Omni DateTime Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => _selectDateTime(context), // Trigger the date-time picker
          child: Text('Pick Date and Time'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to show the Omni DateTime Picker
  void _selectDateTime(BuildContext context) async {
    DateTime? selectedDateTime = await showOmniDateTimePicker(
      context: context,
      title: 'Select Date and Time',
      is24HourMode: true, // Use 24-hour format
      // Additional customization options can be added here
    );

    if (selectedDateTime != null) {
      // Display the selected date and time
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Selected: $selectedDateTime')),
      );
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home widget is DateTimePickerHome, which contains a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it calls the _selectDateTime function.
// 5. The _selectDateTime function opens the Omni DateTime Picker.
// 6. Once the user selects a date and time, it displays the selection in a SnackBar.
```
