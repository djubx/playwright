# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using amazon_like_filter

## Installation
To get started with the `amazon_like_filter` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  amazon_like_filter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/amazon_like_filter).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `amazon_like_filter` package, you will need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:amazon_like_filter/amazon_like_filter.dart';
```

You can then create a filter widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Amazon Like Filter Example')),
      body: FilterWidget(), // Your filter widget goes here
    );
  }
}
```

This sets up the basic structure for using the `amazon_like_filter` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of amazon_like_filter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:amazon_like_filter/amazon_like_filter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Amazon Like Filter Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // This list will hold the filter options
  List<FilterOption> filterOptions = [
    FilterOption(label: 'Electronics', isSelected: false),
    FilterOption(label: 'Books', isSelected: false),
    FilterOption(label: 'Clothing', isSelected: false),
  ];

  // This method will be called when a filter option is selected
  void onFilterChanged(FilterOption option) {
    setState(() {
      option.isSelected = !option.isSelected; // Toggle selection
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Amazon Like Filter Example')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Filter widget that displays the filter options
          FilterWidget(
            options: filterOptions,
            onFilterChanged: onFilterChanged,
          ),
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: 100, // Example item count
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text('Item $index'), // Display item
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The FilterWidget is a custom widget that displays the filter options
class FilterWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<FilterOption> options;
  final Function(FilterOption) onFilterChanged;

  FilterWidget({required this.options, required this.onFilterChanged});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
      child: Column(
        children: options.map((option) {
          return GestureDetector(
            onTap: () => onFilterChanged(option), // Call the callback
            child: Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(10.0),
              margin: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 4.0),
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: option.isSelected ? Colors.blue : Colors.grey[200],
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(5.0),
              ),
              child: Text(option.label, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16)),
            ),
          );
        }).toList(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The FilterOption class represents each filter option
class FilterOption {
  String label;
  bool isSelected;

  FilterOption({required this.label, this.isSelected = false});
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of filter options.
4. The filter options are defined in a list and displayed using the FilterWidget.
5. When a filter option is tapped, the onFilterChanged method toggles its selection state.
6. The ListView displays a list of items (in this case, 100 items) below the filter options.
7. The FilterWidget uses a GestureDetector to handle taps and update the UI accordingly.
