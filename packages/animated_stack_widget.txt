# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Stack Widget

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `animated_stack_widget`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_stack_widget: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your `ios/Podfile` has the platform version set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:animated_stack_widget/animated_stack_widget.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Animated Stack Widget

You can now use the `AnimatedStack` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AnimatedStack(
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
  children: [
    Container(color: Colors.red, height: 200, width: 200),
    Container(color: Colors.green, height: 200, width: 200),
    Container(color: Colors.blue, height: 200, width: 200),
  ],
)
```

This code snippet creates an animated stack with three colored containers. You can customize the duration and add more widgets as needed.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `animated_stack_widget` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Animated Stack Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_stack_widget/animated_stack_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Stack Widget Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Stack Widget Example'),
        ),
        body: AnimatedStackDemo(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class AnimatedStackDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AnimatedStackDemoState createState() => _AnimatedStackDemoState();
}

class _AnimatedStackDemoState extends State<AnimatedStackDemo> {
  // Current index to track which widget is displayed
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  // List of colors to display in the stack
  final List<Color> _colors = [Colors.red, Colors.green, Colors.blue];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          // AnimatedStack widget to display the current color
          AnimatedStack(
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
            children: _colors.map((color) {
              return Container(
                color: color,
                height: 200,
                width: 200,
              );
            }).toList(),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Button to change the current index
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _changeColor,
            child: Text('Next Color'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to change the current index and trigger the animation
  void _changeColor() {
    setState(() {
      _currentIndex = (_currentIndex + 1) % _colors.length;
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The AnimatedStackDemo widget is created, which manages the state of the current color index.
// 4. Inside the AnimatedStackDemo, an AnimatedStack widget is used to display a stack of colored containers.
// 5. A button is provided to change the current color displayed in the stack.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the _changeColor method is called, updating the current index and triggering a rebuild, which animates the transition to the next color.
```
