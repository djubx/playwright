void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scrollable Text Indicator Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override

}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Scrollable Text Indicator Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ScrollableTextIndicator(
          // Set the text to be displayed
          text: 'This is a long text that needs to be displayed in a limited amount of space.',
          
          // Set the text style
          textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.black),
          
          // Set the indicator color
          indicatorColor: Colors.blue,
          
          // Set the indicator width
          indicatorWidth: 10,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application.
// 2. The application displays a scrollable text indicator with a long text.
// 3. The user can scroll the text indicator to view the entire text.
// 4. The text indicator displays a blue indicator to indicate the current scroll position.
// 5. The user can adjust the font size and indicator width to optimize the display.
```

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// The application uses the `ScrollableTextIndicator` widget to display a scrollable text indicator.
// The text indicator displays a long text that can be scrolled by the user.
// The text indicator also displays a blue indicator to indicate the current scroll position.
// The user can adjust the font size and indicator width to optimize the display.
