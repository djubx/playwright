# Complete Example of Using pal_widgets

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pal_widgets/pal_widgets.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pal Widgets Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pal Widgets Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Using a customizable PalCard widget
            PalCard(
              title: 'Welcome to Pal Widgets',
              content: 'This is a demo of the pal_widgets package.',
              onTap: () {
                // Handle card tap
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Using a PalButton widget
            PalButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Handle button press
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Click Me'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. HomePage contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the PalCard and PalButton vertically.
// 6. The PalCard widget displays a title and content, and it can handle tap events.
// 7. The PalButton widget triggers a SnackBar when pressed, providing user feedback.
