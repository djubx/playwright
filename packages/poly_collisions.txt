# Overview of the poly_collisions Flutter Package

The `poly_collisions` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement collision detection in their applications. This package is particularly useful in game development, simulations, and any interactive applications where understanding the spatial relationships between objects is crucial.

## When to Use This Package
- **Game Development**: When creating 2D games where character and object interactions are essential.
- **Simulations**: For applications that require physics simulations, such as particle systems or environmental interactions.
- **Interactive UI**: In scenarios where user interactions with multiple UI elements need to be detected.

## Key Features
- **Polygon Collision Detection**: Supports complex polygon shapes for accurate collision detection.
- **Point-in-Polygon Tests**: Easily check if a point lies within a polygon.
- **Bounding Box Support**: Provides bounding box calculations for quick collision checks.
- **Flexible API**: Simple and intuitive API for integrating collision detection into your Flutter applications.

The `poly_collisions` package is designed to be efficient and easy to use, making it a great choice for developers looking to add collision detection capabilities to their Flutter projects.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using poly_collisions

## Installation
To get started with the `poly_collisions` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  poly_collisions: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `poly_collisions` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:poly_collisions/poly_collisions.dart';
```

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create polygons and check for collisions:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create two polygons
  final polygon1 = Polygon([
    Point(0, 0),
    Point(0, 10),
    Point(10, 10),
    Point(10, 0),
  ]);

  final polygon2 = Polygon([
    Point(5, 5),
    Point(5, 15),
    Point(15, 15),
    Point(15, 5),
  ]);

  // Check for collision
  final isColliding = polygon1.collidesWith(polygon2);
  print('Polygons collide: $isColliding'); // Output: Polygons collide: true
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create two polygons and check if they collide. The `collidesWith` method returns a boolean indicating whether a collision has occurred.

# Complete Example of poly_collisions in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:poly_collisions/poly_collisions.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Poly Collisions Example',
      home: CollisionDetectionScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CollisionDetectionScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create two polygons for collision detection
    final polygon1 = Polygon([
      Point(50, 50),
      Point(50, 150),
      Point(150, 150),
      Point(150, 50),
    ]);

    final polygon2 = Polygon([
      Point(100, 100),
      Point(100, 200),
      Point(200, 200),
      Point(200, 100),
    ]);

    // Check for collision
    final isColliding = polygon1.collidesWith(polygon2);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Collision Detection Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Polygon 1:'),
            CustomPaint(
              size: Size(200, 200),
              painter: PolygonPainter(polygon1, isColliding ? Colors.red : Colors.blue),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Polygon 2:'),
            CustomPaint(
              size: Size(200, 200),
              painter: PolygonPainter(polygon2, isColliding ? Colors.red : Colors.blue),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Polygons collide: $isColliding'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Custom painter to draw polygons
class PolygonPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final Polygon polygon;
  final Color color;

  PolygonPainter(this.polygon, this.color);

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final paint = Paint()
      ..color = color
      ..style = PaintingStyle.fill;

    final path = Path();
    final points = polygon.points;

    path.moveTo(points[0].x, points[0].y);
    for (var point in points.skip(1)) {
      path.lineTo(point.x, point.y);
    }
    path.close();

    canvas.drawPath(path, paint);
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return true;
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// The CollisionDetectionScreen widget creates two polygons and checks for collisions between them.
// It uses a CustomPainter to visually represent the polygons on the screen.
// The polygons are drawn in red if they collide and blue if they do not.
// The result of the collision check is displayed as text on the screen.
