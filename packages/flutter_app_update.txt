# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_app_update

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_app_update` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `flutter_app_update` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_app_update: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_app_update).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

3. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our application. Below is a simple example of how to check for updates and prompt the user.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_app_update/flutter_app_update.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('App Update Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Check for updates
              bool isUpdateAvailable = await FlutterAppUpdate.checkForUpdate();
              if (isUpdateAvailable) {
                // Prompt user to update
                FlutterAppUpdate.promptUpdate();
              } else {
                // Notify user that the app is up to date
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Your app is up to date!')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Check for Updates'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of flutter_app_update

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_app_update/flutter_app_update.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('App Update Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Check for updates
              bool isUpdateAvailable = await FlutterAppUpdate.checkForUpdate();
              if (isUpdateAvailable) {
                // Prompt user to update
                FlutterAppUpdate.promptUpdate();
              } else {
                // Notify user that the app is up to date
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Your app is up to date!')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Check for Updates'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, triggers the update check.
// 4. The app calls `FlutterAppUpdate.checkForUpdate()` to see if a new version is available.
// 5. If an update is available, `FlutterAppUpdate.promptUpdate()` is called to prompt the user to update.
// 6. If no update is available, a SnackBar is shown to inform the user that the app is up to date.
```

In summary, the `flutter_app_update` package provides a straightforward way to manage app updates in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, developers can ensure their users are always on the latest version, enhancing the overall user experience.
