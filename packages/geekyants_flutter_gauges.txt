# Tutorial

## Setup Process
To get started with the `geekyants_flutter_gauges` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     geekyants_flutter_gauges: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and ensure you have the necessary permissions if your app requires them.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:geekyants_flutter_gauges/geekyants_flutter_gauges.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package
Once you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a radial gauge.

```dart
RadialGauge(
  axes: <RadialAxis>[
    RadialAxis(
      minimum: 0,
      maximum: 100,
      ranges: <GaugeRange>[
        GaugeRange(startValue: 0, endValue: 50, color: Colors.green),
        GaugeRange(startValue: 50, endValue: 75, color: Colors.yellow),
        GaugeRange(startValue: 75, endValue: 100, color: Colors.red),
      ],
      pointers: <GaugePointer>[
        NeedlePointer(value: 70),
      ],
    ),
  ],
)
```

This code snippet creates a radial gauge with three color ranges and a needle pointer indicating a value of 70.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:geekyants_flutter_gauges/geekyants_flutter_gauges.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Gauges Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Gauges Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RadialGauge(
            // Creating a radial gauge
            axes: <RadialAxis>[
              RadialAxis(
                minimum: 0, // Minimum value of the gauge
                maximum: 100, // Maximum value of the gauge
                ranges: <GaugeRange>[
                  // Defining color ranges
                  GaugeRange(startValue: 0, endValue: 50, color: Colors.green),
                  GaugeRange(startValue: 50, endValue: 75, color: Colors.yellow),
                  GaugeRange(startValue: 75, endValue: 100, color: Colors.red),
                ],
                pointers: <GaugePointer>[
                  // Adding a needle pointer
                  NeedlePointer(value: 70), // Current value of the gauge
                ],
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Flutter Gauges Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a RadialGauge widget.
// 5. The RadialGauge has one RadialAxis with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100.
// 6. Three GaugeRanges are defined to color the gauge based on the value: green (0-50), yellow (50-75), and red (75-100).
// 7. A NeedlePointer is added to indicate the current value of 70 on the gauge.
