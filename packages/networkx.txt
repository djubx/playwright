# NetworkX Flutter Package
The NetworkX Flutter package is a powerful library for creating and manipulating complex networks. It provides an efficient way to handle large amounts of data and perform various operations on the network.

## When to Use
This package is ideal for applications that require network analysis, such as social media platforms, traffic management systems, and recommendation engines.

## Features
Some of the key features of the NetworkX Flutter package include:

*   Creating and manipulating directed and undirected graphs
*   Adding and removing nodes and edges
*   Calculating various network metrics, such as degree centrality and betweenness centrality
*   Performing network traversal algorithms, such as breadth-first search and depth-first search
*   Visualizing networks using various layouts

# Setting Up the Package
To use the NetworkX Flutter package, you need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  networkx: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
The NetworkX Flutter package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you need to configure the platform-specific files to use the package.

For Android, you need to add the following lines to your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
  ...
  defaultConfig {
    ...
    multiDexEnabled true
  }
}
```

For iOS, you need to add the following lines to your `ios/Podfile` file:

```ruby
target 'Runner' do
  ...
  pod 'NetworkX', '~> 1.0.0'
end
```

## Required Configurations and Optimizations
To use the NetworkX Flutter package efficiently, you need to configure and optimize your project. Here are some tips:

*   Use a recent version of the Flutter SDK.
*   Enable the `--no-sound-null-safety` flag when running your project.
*   Use a powerful device or emulator to run your project.

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a home page.
// 2. The user can add nodes to the graph by clicking the 'Add Nodes' button.
// 3. The user can add edges to the graph by clicking the 'Add Edges' button.
// 4. The user can calculate the degree centrality of the graph by clicking the 'Calculate Degree Centrality' button.
// 5. The user can perform a breadth-first search on the graph by clicking the 'Perform BFS' button.
// 6. The results of the calculations and searches are printed to the console.

// In summary, this app demonstrates the basic functionality of the NetworkX package.
// It allows users to create a graph, add nodes and edges, and perform various calculations and searches on the graph.
