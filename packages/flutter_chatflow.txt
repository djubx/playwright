# Tutorial: Setting Up Flutter Chatflow

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **flutter_chatflow** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **flutter_chatflow** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_chatflow: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_chatflow).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions if you plan to use any media features:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to send images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to send photos.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple chat interface using the `RealFlutter` class.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_chatflow/flutter_chatflow.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Chatflow Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the chat controller
  final ChatController _chatController = ChatController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chat Interface'),
      ),
      body: ChatFlow(
        controller: _chatController,
        onSend: (message) {
          // Handle sending messages
          _chatController.sendMessage(message);
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple chat interface using the `ChatFlow` widget. The `onSend` callback is used to handle sending messages.

# Complete Example of Flutter Chatflow

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the **flutter_chatflow** package. This example demonstrates all key features of the package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_chatflow/flutter_chatflow.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Chatflow Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the chat controller
  final ChatController _chatController = ChatController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chat Interface'),
      ),
      body: ChatFlow(
        controller: _chatController,
        onSend: (message) {
          // Handle sending messages
          _chatController.sendMessage(message);
        },
        onReceive: (message) {
          // Handle receiving messages
          print("Received message: $message");
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, setting RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages the chat interface.
// 4. Inside _RealFlutterState, we initialize a ChatController to manage chat messages.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a ChatFlow widget.
// 6. The ChatFlow widget takes the controller and defines onSend and onReceive callbacks.
// 7. onSend is triggered when a message is sent, and onReceive is triggered when a message is received.
// 8. The app prints received messages to the console, allowing for further processing or display.
```

In this complete example, we have implemented a basic chat interface using the **flutter_chatflow** package. The application initializes a chat controller and handles sending and receiving messages.

### Summary of Application Flow

// The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the Flutter app.
// The `MyApp` class sets up the MaterialApp and defines the theme and home widget.
// The `RealFlutter` class is a StatefulWidget that manages the chat interface.
// Inside the `_RealFlutterState`, we create an instance of `ChatController` to manage chat messages.
// The `build` method constructs the UI, including an AppBar and the `ChatFlow` widget.
// The `ChatFlow` widget handles sending and receiving messages through the defined callbacks.
// When a message is sent, it is processed by the `onSend` callback, and when a message is received, it is printed to the console via the `onReceive` callback.
// This structure allows for easy integration of chat functionalities in Flutter applications.
