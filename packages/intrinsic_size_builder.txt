Intrinsic Size Builder Package
==============================

The `intrinsic_size_builder` package is a Flutter package that allows you to build widgets with intrinsic sizes. Intrinsic sizes are the natural sizes of a widget, which are calculated based on the widget's content and layout.

When to Use This Package
------------------------

This package is useful when you need to build widgets that have a fixed size, but the size is not known until runtime. For example, you might use this package to build a widget that displays an image, where the size of the image is not known until it is loaded.

Features
--------

*   Allows you to build widgets with intrinsic sizes.
*   Supports building widgets with fixed widths and/or heights.
*   Works with any type of widget, including custom widgets.

Setup and Usage
----------------

To use the `intrinsic_size_builder` package, you need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file. Here's how to do it:

1.  Open your project's `pubspec.yaml` file.
2.  Add the following line to the `dependencies` section:

    ```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  intrinsic_size_builder: ^1.0.0
```

3.  Run `flutter pub get` to get the package.

Now you can use the package in your project.

### Platform-Specific Details

This package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details to keep in mind:

*   On Android, the `intrinsic_size_builder` package uses the `android.view.View` class to measure the size of widgets.
*   On iOS, the package uses the `UIView` class to measure the size of widgets.

### Required Configurations or Optimizations

There are no required configurations or optimizations for this package. However, you might need to adjust the size of your widgets based on the device's screen size and density.

    // Create a widget with intrinsic size
    Widget widgetWithIntrinsicSize = IntrinsicSizeBuilder(
      builder: (context, width, height) {
        // Return a widget with the calculated size
        return Container(
          width: width,
          height: height,
          color: Colors.red,
        );
      },
    );

    // Create a column with the widget
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Intrinsic Size Builder Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            widgetWithIntrinsicSize,
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// This is the main file of the Flutter application.
// It creates a Material app with a home page.
// The home page has a column with a single child.
// The child is a widget with intrinsic size, created using the IntrinsicSizeBuilder.
// The IntrinsicSizeBuilder calculates the size of the widget based on its content and layout.
// The calculated size is then used to create a Container with the same size.
// The Container is then returned as the child of the column.
// The column is then returned as the body of the Scaffold.
// The Scaffold is then returned as the home page of the Material app.

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application.
// 2. The Material app is created with the home page.
// 3. The home page is created with the column.
// 4. The column is created with the widget with intrinsic size.
// 5. The IntrinsicSizeBuilder calculates the size of the widget.
// 6. The Container is created with the calculated size.
// 7. The Container is returned as the child of the column.
// 8. The column is returned as the body of the Scaffold.
// 9. The Scaffold is returned as the home page of the Material app.
// 10. The Material app is displayed to the user.
