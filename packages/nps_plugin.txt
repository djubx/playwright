# Complete Example of Using nps_plugin

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nps_plugin/nps_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'NPS Plugin Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('NPS Plugin Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Call the function to show the NPS survey
            showNpsSurvey();
          },
          child: Text('Show NPS Survey'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showNpsSurvey() {
    // Show the NPS survey using the nps_plugin
    NpsPlugin.showNpsSurvey(
      appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID', // Replace with your app ID
      onSurveyCompleted: (response) {
        // Handle the survey response
        print('NPS Response: $response');
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a button that, when pressed, triggers the showNpsSurvey function.
// 4. The showNpsSurvey function calls the NpsPlugin to display the NPS survey.
// 5. Once the user completes the survey, the response is printed to the console.
