# Overview of the `flutter_esc_pos_utils` Package

The `flutter_esc_pos_utils` package is a powerful utility for Flutter developers who need to interact with ESC/POS printers. ESC/POS is a widely used command system for controlling receipt printers, commonly found in retail and hospitality environments. This package simplifies the process of generating and sending commands to these printers, making it an essential tool for applications that require printing capabilities.

## When to Use `flutter_esc_pos_utils`

- **Retail Applications**: For generating receipts in point-of-sale systems.
- **Hospitality Management**: To print orders or invoices in restaurants and hotels.
- **Inventory Systems**: For printing labels or inventory lists.
- **Event Management**: To print tickets or badges on the spot.

## Key Features

- **Text Formatting**: Supports various text styles, including bold, underline, and different font sizes.
- **Image Printing**: Allows printing of images and QR codes.
- **Barcode Printing**: Supports multiple barcode formats.
- **Custom Commands**: Enables sending custom ESC/POS commands for advanced use cases.

# Setting Up and Using `flutter_esc_pos_utils`

In this section, we'll walk through the setup process for the `flutter_esc_pos_utils` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `flutter_esc_pos_utils` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_esc_pos_utils: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to access Bluetooth or USB, depending on your printer connection method. Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
```

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your app's `Info.plist` includes the necessary permissions for Bluetooth access:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your permission to use Bluetooth to connect to printers.</string>
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_esc_pos_utils/flutter_esc_pos_utils.dart';
```

## Using the Package

To use the package, you need to create an instance of the `Generator` class, which is responsible for creating the ESC/POS commands.

```dart
final profile = await CapabilityProfile.load();
final generator = Generator(PaperSize.mm80, profile);
```

- **PaperSize**: Defines the paper size of the printer.
- **CapabilityProfile**: Loads the printer's capability profile, which defines supported features.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_esc_pos_utils/flutter_esc_pos_utils.dart';
import 'package:esc_pos_printer/esc_pos_printer.dart'; // Assume this is a package for printer communication

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter ESC/POS Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: PrintDemoPage(),
    );
  }
}

class PrintDemoPage extends StatelessWidget {
  Future<void> _printReceipt() async {
    // Load the printer's capability profile
    final profile = await CapabilityProfile.load();
    // Create a generator for ESC/POS commands
    final generator = Generator(PaperSize.mm80, profile);

    // Create a list of commands to send to the printer
    final List<int> bytes = [];

    // Add text to the receipt
    bytes += generator.text('Flutter ESC/POS Demo',
        styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center, bold: true));

    // Add a QR code
    bytes += generator.qrcode('https://flutter.dev');

    // Add a barcode
    bytes += generator.barcode(Barcode.upcA('123456789012'));

    // Add a cut command
    bytes += generator.cut();

    // Connect to the printer and send the commands
    final printer = NetworkPrinter(PaperSize.mm80, profile);
    final res = await printer.connect('192.168.0.123', port: 9100);

    if (res == PosPrintResult.success) {
      printer.sendBytes(bytes);
      printer.disconnect();
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Print Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _printReceipt,
          child: Text('Print Receipt'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The application starts with the `MyApp` widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home screen is `PrintDemoPage`, which contains a button to print a receipt.
// 3. When the button is pressed, `_printReceipt` is called.
// 4. `_printReceipt` initializes the printer's capability profile and creates a generator for ESC/POS commands.
// 5. It constructs a list of commands, including text, a QR code, and a barcode.
// 6. The application attempts to connect to a network printer using its IP address.
// 7. If the connection is successful, the commands are sent to the printer, and the connection is closed.
