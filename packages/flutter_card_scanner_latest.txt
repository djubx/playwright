# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_card_scanner_latest

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_card_scanner_latest` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_card_scanner_latest` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_card_scanner_latest: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_card_scanner_latest).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera to scan cards.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's implement it in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_card_scanner_latest/flutter_card_scanner_latest.dart';
   ```

2. Create a simple UI to trigger the card scanning process:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:flutter_card_scanner_latest/flutter_card_scanner_latest.dart';

   class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return MaterialApp(
         home: Scaffold(
           appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Card Scanner')),
           body: Center(
             child: ElevatedButton(
               onPressed: () async {
                 // Start the card scanning process
                 final result = await FlutterCardScanner.scanCard();
                 if (result != null) {
                   // Handle the scanned card data
                   print('Card Number: ${result.cardNumber}');
                 }
               },
               child: Text('Scan Card'),
             ),
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

3. Run your application on a physical device (as card scanning requires camera access).

With these steps, you have successfully set up and used the `flutter_card_scanner_latest` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example: RealFlutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_card_scanner_latest/flutter_card_scanner_latest.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Card Scanner')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Start the card scanning process
              final result = await FlutterCardScanner.scanCard();
              if (result != null) {
                // Handle the scanned card data
                print('Card Number: ${result.cardNumber}');
                // Display the scanned card information
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Scanned Card'),
                    content: Text('Card Number: ${result.cardNumber}'),
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                        child: Text('OK'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Scan Card'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created to trigger the card scanning process.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the scanCard method from the flutter_card_scanner_latest package is called.
// 5. If a card is successfully scanned, the card number is printed to the console and displayed in a dialog box.
// 6. The user can dismiss the dialog by pressing the 'OK' button.
```
