// Here's a step-by-step explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The user clicks the "Start Operations" button, which calls the `_startOperations` function.
// 2. The `_startOperations` function adds 10 asynchronous operations to the `PLimit` queue.
// 3. Each operation is executed when a slot becomes available, and it performs a 1-second delay using `Future.delayed`.
// 4. After the delay, the operation prints a completion message to the console and increments the `_operationCount` variable.
// 5. The UI is updated to display the new operation count.

// In summary, the application uses the `p_limit` package to limit the number of concurrent asynchronous operations to 5. When the user clicks the "Start Operations" button, the application adds 10 operations to the queue, each of which is executed when a slot becomes available. The application updates the UI to display the operation count in real-time.
