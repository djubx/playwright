# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_idensic_mobile_sdk_plugin

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_idensic_mobile_sdk_plugin` and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_idensic_mobile_sdk_plugin` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_idensic_mobile_sdk_plugin: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>

    <application
        android:label="yourapp"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        <meta-data
            android:name="flutter_idensic_sdk_key"
            android:value="YOUR_SDK_KEY_HERE"/> <!-- Replace with your SDK key -->
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for identity verification.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library for identity verification.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have configured the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `RealFlutter` class to utilize the identity verification features.

# Complete Example: Using flutter_idensic_mobile_sdk_plugin

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_idensic_mobile_sdk_plugin/flutter_idensic_mobile_sdk_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Identity Verification App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  String _verificationResult = "Not Verified";

  // Function to initiate identity verification
  void _verifyIdentity() async {
    try {
      // Start the identity verification process
      final result = await FlutterIdensicMobileSdkPlugin.verifyIdentity();
      setState(() {
        _verificationResult = result ? "Verified" : "Not Verified";
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors during the verification process
      setState(() {
        _verificationResult = "Error: ${e.toString()}";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Identity Verification'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Verification Status: $_verificationResult',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _verifyIdentity,
              child: Text('Verify Identity'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a HomePage as its home.
// 3. HomePage contains a button to initiate the identity verification process.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _verifyIdentity function is called.
// 5. This function calls the verifyIdentity method from the flutter_idensic_mobile_sdk_plugin.
// 6. The result of the verification is displayed on the screen.
// 7. If an error occurs during verification, it is caught and displayed as well.
```
