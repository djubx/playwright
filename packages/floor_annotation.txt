Here's a detailed technical blog on the "floor_annotation" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Floor Annotation Flutter Package

The **floor_annotation** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of creating and managing floor plans in mobile applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require spatial awareness, such as real estate apps, indoor navigation systems, and augmented reality experiences. 

## When to Use This Package
You should consider using the **floor_annotation** package when:
- You need to display complex floor plans or layouts in your Flutter application.
- You want to annotate specific areas of a floor plan with interactive elements.
- You are developing applications that require user interaction with spatial data, such as selecting rooms or areas on a map.

## Features
- **Custom Annotations**: Easily add custom annotations to your floor plans.
- **Interactive Elements**: Support for interactive elements that respond to user input.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Flexible Layouts**: Allows for flexible and responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

The **floor_annotation** package is designed to enhance user experience by providing a visually appealing and interactive way to present spatial information.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Floor Annotation Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **floor_annotation** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  floor_annotation: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31  // Use the latest SDK version
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.4.0'  // Required for Material Design components
    ...
}
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Podfile`.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```ruby
platform :ios, '12.0'  # Minimum iOS version
```

3. Run the following command to install the pods:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a floor plan with annotations.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:floor_annotation/floor_annotation.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Floor Annotation Example',
      home: FloorPlanScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FloorPlanScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Floor Plan'),
      ),
      body: FloorPlanWidget(), // Custom widget to display the floor plan
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a floor plan. The `FloorPlanWidget` is where you will implement the annotations and interactive elements.

# Complete Example of Using the Floor Annotation Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:floor_annotation/floor_annotation.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Floor Annotation Example',
      home: FloorPlanScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FloorPlanScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Floor Plan'),
      ),
      body: FloorPlanWidget(), // Custom widget to display the floor plan
    );
  }
}

class FloorPlanWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Stack(
      children: [
        // Background image of the floor plan
        Image.asset('assets/floor_plan.png'), // Replace with your floor plan image

        // Example annotation
        Positioned(
          left: 100,
          top: 150,
          child: GestureDetector(
            onTap: () {
              // Action when the annotation is tapped
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Room 101'),
                  content: Text('This is Room 101.'),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                      child: Text('Close'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Container(
              width: 80,
              height: 80,
              color: Colors.red.withOpacity(0.5), // Semi-transparent red box
              child: Center(child: Text('Room 101')),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets FloorPlanScreen as the home widget.
// 3. FloorPlanScreen creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing FloorPlanWidget.
// 4. FloorPlanWidget displays a background image of the floor plan and overlays an interactive annotation.
// 5. The annotation is a red box that, when tapped, shows a dialog with information about Room 101.
```
