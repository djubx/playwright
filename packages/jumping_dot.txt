# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Jumping Dot

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **jumping_dot** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **jumping_dot** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  jumping_dot: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Jumping Dot Widget

Now that you have set up the package, you can use the `JumpingDot` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:jumping_dot/jumping_dot.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Jumping Dot Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: JumpingDot(
            color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the dots
            dotSize: 20.0, // Set the size of the dots
            numberOfDots: 3, // Number of dots to display
            animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Animation duration
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays the jumping dots in the center of the screen. You can customize the color, size, number of dots, and animation duration as per your requirements.

# Complete Example of Jumping Dot

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:jumping_dot/jumping_dot.dart';

// Main class of the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Jumping Dot Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the jumping dots in the middle of the screen
          child: JumpingDot(
            color: Colors.blue, // Color of the jumping dots
            dotSize: 20.0, // Size of each dot
            numberOfDots: 3, // Total number of dots to display
            animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Duration of the jumping animation
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the basic structure of the app.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which includes an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title "Jumping Dot Example" at the top of the screen.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child widget.
// 6. The child of the Center widget is the JumpingDot widget, which displays animated dots.
// 7. The JumpingDot widget is configured with a blue color, a dot size of 20.0, three dots, and an animation duration of 500 milliseconds.
// 8. As a result, when the app runs, users will see three blue dots jumping in sequence, indicating a loading state.
```
