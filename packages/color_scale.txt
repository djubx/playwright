// The app starts by running the RealFlutter widget, which is a stateless widget that builds a MaterialApp.
// The MaterialApp has a title, a theme, and a home page, which is the ColorScaleDemo widget.
// The ColorScaleDemo widget is a stateful widget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// The body is a Center widget that contains a Column widget with two children: a horizontal color scale and a vertical color scale.
// Each color scale is created using the ColorScale widget, which takes the start and end colors, the number of steps, and the direction as parameters.
