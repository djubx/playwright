# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Mouse Parallax Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `mouse_parallax` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mouse_parallax: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Android

Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### For iOS

In your `ios/Podfile`, ensure that the platform is set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement the parallax effect.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:mouse_parallax/mouse_parallax.dart';
```

2. Wrap your widget tree with the `MouseParallax` widget:

```dart
MouseParallax(
  child: YourWidget(),
)
```

3. Customize the parallax effect by adjusting the `parallaxFactor` and `direction` properties.

### Example Usage

Here’s a simple example of how to use the `mouse_parallax` package in a Flutter application:

```dart
MouseParallax(
  parallaxFactor: 0.1, // Adjust the intensity of the effect
  direction: ParallaxDirection.all, // Apply effect in all directions
  child: Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
    child: Center(
      child: Text(
        'Mouse Parallax Effect',
        style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
      ),
    ),
  ),
)
```

This setup will create a container that moves slightly in response to mouse movements, creating a parallax effect.

# Complete Example of Mouse Parallax in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mouse_parallax/mouse_parallax.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Mouse Parallax Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Mouse Parallax Example'),
        ),
        body: MouseParallax(
          parallaxFactor: 0.1, // Set the intensity of the parallax effect
          direction: ParallaxDirection.all, // Enable parallax in all directions
          child: Stack(
            children: [
              // Background layer
              Container(
                color: Colors.blueAccent,
              ),
              // Foreground layer
              Center(
                child: Container(
                  width: 300,
                  height: 300,
                  decoration: BoxDecoration(
                    color: Colors.white,
                    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(15),
                    boxShadow: [
                      BoxShadow(
                        color: Colors.black26,
                        blurRadius: 10,
                        offset: Offset(0, 5),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                  child: Center(
                    child: Text(
                      'Hover over me!',
                      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.black),
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body is wrapped in a MouseParallax widget, which enables the parallax effect.
// 5. The parallax effect is set with a factor of 0.1 and applies in all directions.
// 6. Inside the MouseParallax, a Stack widget is used to layer a blue background and a white foreground container.
// 7. The foreground container displays a text message, "Hover over me!", which will respond to mouse movements, creating an engaging user experience.
