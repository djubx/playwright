<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# dio_http_formatter Flutter Package

The `dio_http_formatter` package is a powerful tool designed to enhance the capabilities of the Dio HTTP client in Flutter applications. It provides a way to format HTTP requests and responses, making it easier to debug and log network interactions. This package is particularly useful for developers who need to monitor API calls and responses in a structured manner.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using `dio_http_formatter` in scenarios such as:

- **Debugging API Calls**: When developing applications that rely heavily on API interactions, having a clear view of the requests and responses can significantly speed up the debugging process.
- **Logging Network Activity**: For applications that require logging of network activity for analytics or monitoring, this package provides a structured way to log HTTP interactions.
- **Customizing Request/Response Formats**: If you need to customize how requests and responses are formatted for better readability or specific logging requirements, this package allows for that flexibility.

## Features

- **Request and Response Formatting**: Automatically formats HTTP requests and responses for better readability.
- **Customizable Logging**: Allows developers to customize how logs are generated and displayed.
- **Integration with Dio**: Seamlessly integrates with the Dio HTTP client, making it easy to implement in existing projects.

Overall, `dio_http_formatter` is an essential package for Flutter developers looking to enhance their network request handling and debugging capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up dio_http_formatter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `dio_http_formatter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `dio_http_formatter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dio: ^5.0.0
  dio_http_formatter: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependencies.

## Step 2: Basic Setup

Next, you need to set up Dio with the `dio_http_formatter`. Here’s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:dio_http_formatter/dio_http_formatter.dart';

void main() {
  // Create a Dio instance
  final dio = Dio();

  // Add the formatter interceptor
  dio.interceptors.add(DioHttpFormatter());

  // Now you can use dio to make requests
}
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow HTTP requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Making Requests

You can now make HTTP requests using the Dio instance with the formatter. Here’s an example of a GET request:

```dart
void fetchData() async {
  try {
    final response = await dio.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
    print(response.data);
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error: $e');
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

You have now set up the `dio_http_formatter` package in your Flutter application. You can use it to format and log your HTTP requests and responses effectively.

# Complete Example of dio_http_formatter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:dio_http_formatter/dio_http_formatter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dio HTTP Formatter Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// Home page widget
class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  final Dio dio = Dio(); // Create a Dio instance

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    dio.interceptors.add(DioHttpFormatter()); // Add the formatter interceptor
    fetchData(); // Fetch data when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to fetch data from the API
  void fetchData() async {
    try {
      // Make a GET request
      final response = await dio.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
      // Update the UI with the fetched data
      print(response.data); // Print the response data
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error: $e'); // Handle any errors
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dio HTTP Formatter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Check console for API response!'), // Inform user to check console
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. The HomePage widget is a stateful widget that initializes a Dio instance in its state.
// 4. In the initState() method, the DioHttpFormatter interceptor is added to the Dio instance.
// 5. The fetchData() method is called to make a GET request to the JSONPlaceholder API.
// 6. The response data is printed to the console, and any errors are caught and printed.
// 7. The UI displays a simple message instructing the user to check the console for the API response.
```
