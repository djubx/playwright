# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using HTML Editor Enhanced

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `html_editor_enhanced` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `html_editor_enhanced` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  html_editor_enhanced: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions for internet access and file storage:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application
        android:label="yourapp"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        <activity
            android:name=".MainActivity"
            android:launchMode="singleTop"
            android:theme="@style/LaunchTheme"
            android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|smallestScreenSize|locale|layoutDirection|fontScale|screenLayout|direction|uiMode"
            android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
            android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
            <meta-data
                android:name="flutterEmbedding"
                android:value="2" />
        </activity>
    </application>

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take pictures.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio input.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the HTML editor.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:html_editor_enhanced/html_editor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'HTML Editor Enhanced Example',
      home: EditorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class EditorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EditorScreenState createState() => _EditorScreenState();
}

class _EditorScreenState extends State<EditorScreen> {
  // Create a controller for the HTML editor
  final HtmlEditorController _controller = HtmlEditorController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('HTML Editor Enhanced'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.save),
            onPressed: () async {
              // Get the HTML content from the editor
              String? content = await _controller.getText();
              // Here you can save the content to your backend or database
              print(content); // For demonstration, we print it to the console
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: HtmlEditor(
        controller: _controller,
        htmlEditorOptions: HtmlEditorOptions(
          hint: "Your text here...",
        ),
        otherOptions: OtherOptions(
          height: 400,
        ),
        callbacks: Callbacks(
          onChangeContent: (String? content) {
            // This callback is triggered when the content changes
            print("Content changed: $content");
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The EditorScreen widget is created, which contains the HTML editor.
// 4. An HtmlEditorController is instantiated to control the editor.
// 5. The Scaffold widget provides the app structure with an AppBar and body.
// 6. The AppBar contains a save button that retrieves the HTML content when pressed.
// 7. The HtmlEditor widget is displayed, allowing users to input and format text.
// 8. The onChangeContent callback prints the current content to the console whenever it changes.
