# Overview of the wav_io Flutter Package

The `wav_io` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to work with WAV audio files. It provides a straightforward API for reading and writing WAV files, making it an excellent choice for applications that require audio processing, such as music players, audio editors, or any app that needs to handle audio data.

## When to Use `wav_io`
- **Audio Applications**: If you're building an app that needs to play, record, or manipulate audio files, `wav_io` is a great choice.
- **Data Analysis**: For applications that analyze audio data, such as visualizers or sound analysis tools, this package can help you read and write WAV files easily.

## Key Features
- **Read WAV Files**: Load WAV files into your application and access their audio data.
- **Write WAV Files**: Create and save new WAV files from audio data.
- **Support for PCM Format**: Works with Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) audio, which is the most common format for WAV files.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using wav_io

## Installation
To get started with the `wav_io` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  wav_io: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app accesses the microphone or file storage. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio recording.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save audio files.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `wav_io` package to read and write WAV files:

1. **Reading a WAV File**:
   You can read a WAV file from the device storage and access its audio data.

2. **Writing a WAV File**:
   You can create a new WAV file from audio data and save it to the device.

### Example Code
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wav_io/wav_io.dart';
import 'dart:io';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<int>? audioData;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load WAV file when the app starts
    loadWavFile();
  }

  Future<void> loadWavFile() async {
    // Specify the path to the WAV file
    final file = File('path/to/your/audio.wav');
    // Read the WAV file
    final wavFile = await WavReader.read(file);
    // Store the audio data
    setState(() {
      audioData = wavFile.data;
    });
  }

  Future<void> saveWavFile() async {
    // Create a new WAV file with the audio data
    final newFile = File('path/to/save/new_audio.wav');
    final wavFile = WavWriter(
      sampleRate: 44100,
      channels: 2,
      data: audioData!,
    );
    // Write the WAV file
    await newFile.writeAsBytes(wavFile.write());
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('WAV IO Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: audioData == null
            ? CircularProgressIndicator()
            : ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: saveWavFile,
                child: Text('Save WAV File'),
              ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using wav_io

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wav_io/wav_io.dart';
import 'dart:io';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<int>? audioData; // Variable to hold audio data

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load WAV file when the app starts
    loadWavFile();
  }

  Future<void> loadWavFile() async {
    // Specify the path to the WAV file
    final file = File('path/to/your/audio.wav');
    // Read the WAV file
    final wavFile = await WavReader.read(file);
    // Store the audio data
    setState(() {
      audioData = wavFile.data; // Update state with audio data
    });
  }

  Future<void> saveWavFile() async {
    // Create a new WAV file with the audio data
    final newFile = File('path/to/save/new_audio.wav');
    final wavFile = WavWriter(
      sampleRate: 44100, // Set sample rate
      channels: 2, // Set number of channels
      data: audioData!, // Use the loaded audio data
    );
    // Write the WAV file
    await newFile.writeAsBytes(wavFile.write()); // Save the new WAV file
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('WAV IO Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: audioData == null
            ? CircularProgressIndicator() // Show loading indicator
            : ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: saveWavFile, // Save WAV file on button press
                child: Text('Save WAV File'),
              ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the `initState` method is called.
// 2. The `loadWavFile` method is invoked to read a WAV file from the specified path.
// 3. The WAV file is read using `WavReader`, and the audio data is stored in the `audioData` variable.
// 4. Once the audio data is loaded, the UI updates to show a button.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the `saveWavFile` method is called.
// 6. A new WAV file is created using `WavWriter`, and the audio data is written to it.
// 7. The new WAV file is saved to the specified path.
