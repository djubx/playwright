# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Stream Video Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `stream_video_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `stream_video_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stream_video_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/stream_video_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in the `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple video streaming application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:stream_video_flutter/stream_video_flutter.dart';
   ```

2. Create a `RealFlutter` class that extends `StatelessWidget` or `StatefulWidget` depending on your needs.

3. Use the `StreamVideoPlayer` widget to display the video.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the video player in your app.

# Complete Example of Stream Video Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stream_video_flutter/stream_video_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stream Video Example',
      home: VideoPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoPlayerScreenState createState() => _VideoPlayerScreenState();
}

class _VideoPlayerScreenState extends State<VideoPlayerScreen> {
  // URL of the video to be streamed
  final String videoUrl = 'https://example.com/video.mp4';
  late StreamVideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the video player controller with the video URL
    _controller = StreamVideoPlayerController.network(videoUrl);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Stream Video Player'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: StreamVideoPlayer(
          controller: _controller,
          // Display a loading indicator while the video is buffering
          loadingBuilder: (context) => CircularProgressIndicator(),
          // Display the video player controls
          controls: StreamVideoControls(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The VideoPlayerScreen widget is created, which manages the video player state.
// 4. In initState, a StreamVideoPlayerController is initialized with the video URL.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, the StreamVideoPlayer is used to display the video.
// 7. A loading indicator is shown while the video is buffering, and the video controls are displayed for user interaction.
// 8. When the widget is disposed, the controller is also disposed to free up resources.
```
