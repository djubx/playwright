It provides a unified API for manipulating HTML documents, making it easier to create web applications or handle HTML content in mobile apps. This package is particularly useful when you want to render HTML content, parse HTML documents, or manipulate DOM elements in a way that is consistent across different platforms.

## When to Use `universal_html`

- **Web Applications**: If you are building a Flutter web application that requires HTML manipulation or rendering.
- **Mobile Apps with HTML Content**: When your mobile app needs to display HTML content fetched from a server or local storage.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: To ensure that your HTML handling code works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

## Key Features

- **DOM Manipulation**: Provides a set of APIs to manipulate HTML documents and elements.
- **HTML Parsing**: Easily parse HTML strings into DOM elements.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Flutter web and mobile platforms.
- **Rich Text Rendering**: Supports rendering rich text content with HTML tags.

# Setting Up and Using the Universal HTML Package

## Installation

To use the `universal_html` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  universal_html: ^2.0.20  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, no additional configuration is required. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you are fetching HTML content from the internet. You may need to add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the `universal_html` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:universal_html/html.dart' as html;
```

2. Use the package to manipulate HTML content. For example, you can create a simple HTML element and append it to the body:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create a new paragraph element
  var paragraph = html.ParagraphElement();
  paragraph.text = 'Hello, Universal HTML!';
  
  // Append the paragraph to the body
  html.document.body?.append(paragraph);
}
```

This code creates a new paragraph element and appends it to the document body, displaying the text "Hello, Universal HTML!" on the web page.

# Complete Example of Using Universal HTML

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:universal_html/html.dart' as html;

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Universal HTML Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Universal HTML Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _createHtmlElement,
            child: Text('Create HTML Element'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to create and append an HTML element
  void _createHtmlElement() {
    // Create a new paragraph element
    var paragraph = html.ParagraphElement();
    paragraph.text = 'Hello, Universal HTML! This is a dynamic paragraph.';

    // Set some styles for the paragraph
    paragraph.style.color = 'blue';
    paragraph.style.fontSize = '20px';

    // Append the paragraph to the body of the HTML document
    html.document.body?.append(paragraph);
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _createHtmlElement function is called.
// 5. Inside _createHtmlElement, a new paragraph element is created using the universal_html package.
// 6. The text and styles for the paragraph are set.
// 7. Finally, the paragraph is appended to the document body, making it visible on the web page.
```

### Summary

In this blog post, we explored the `universal_html` package, which allows Flutter developers to manipulate and render HTML content across platforms. We covered the installation process, platform-specific configurations, and provided a complete example demonstrating how to create and append HTML elements dynamically. This package is particularly useful for web applications and mobile apps that require HTML content handling, making it a valuable tool in a Flutter developer's toolkit.
