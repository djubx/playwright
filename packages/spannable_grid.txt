# Spannable Grid Flutter Package

The **spannable_grid** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to create flexible and dynamic grid layouts in Flutter applications. It allows developers to create grids where items can span multiple rows and columns, providing a more versatile layout compared to traditional grid views. This package is particularly useful for applications that require a responsive design, such as photo galleries, dashboards, or any application where content needs to be displayed in a grid format.

## When to Use

You should consider using the **spannable_grid** package when:
- You need a grid layout that allows items to span multiple cells.
- You want to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
- You are building applications that require complex layouts, such as media galleries or data dashboards.

## Features

- **Dynamic Item Spanning**: Easily configure items to span multiple rows and columns.
- **Customizable Layout**: Adjust the number of columns and the spacing between items.
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications.

With these features, the **spannable_grid** package enhances the flexibility and usability of grid layouts in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Spannable Grid Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **spannable_grid** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  spannable_grid: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/spannable_grid).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:spannable_grid/spannable_grid.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Spannable Grid

You can now use the `SpannableGrid` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
SpannableGrid(
  columnCount: 3, // Number of columns in the grid
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return Container(
      color: Colors.blue,
      child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
    );
  },
  itemCount: 30, // Total number of items
);
```

This code creates a grid with 3 columns and 30 items, each represented by a blue container with text.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the **spannable_grid** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the Spannable Grid Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:spannable_grid/spannable_grid.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Spannable Grid Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Spannable Grid Example'),
        ),
        body: SpannableGrid(
          columnCount: 3, // Set the number of columns in the grid
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            // Build each item in the grid
            return Container(
              margin: EdgeInsets.all(4.0), // Add margin around each item
              color: Colors.blue[(index % 9 + 1) * 100], // Color based on index
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Item $index',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 16),
                ),
              ),
            );
          },
          itemCount: 30, // Total number of items to display
          gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
            crossAxisCount: 3, // Number of columns
            childAspectRatio: 1, // Aspect ratio of each item
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Spannable Grid Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a SpannableGrid widget.
// 5. The SpannableGrid is configured with 3 columns and a total of 30 items.
// 6. Each item is built using a Container with a dynamic color and centered text.
// 7. The grid layout is defined by a SliverGridDelegate, ensuring a fixed number of columns and a square aspect ratio for each item.
