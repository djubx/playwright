# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using lecle_bubble_timeline

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `lecle_bubble_timeline` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  lecle_bubble_timeline: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:lecle_bubble_timeline/lecle_bubble_timeline.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Timeline Widget
You can now use the `BubbleTimeline` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
BubbleTimeline(
  items: [
    TimelineItem(
      title: 'Event 1',
      description: 'Description of Event 1',
      date: '2024-01-01',
      icon: Icons.event,
    ),
    TimelineItem(
      title: 'Event 2',
      description: 'Description of Event 2',
      date: '2024-02-01',
      icon: Icons.event,
    ),
    // Add more events as needed
  ],
  bubbleColor: Colors.blue,
  lineColor: Colors.grey,
);
```

This code snippet creates a simple vertical timeline with two events. You can customize the `bubbleColor` and `lineColor` to match your app's theme.

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bubble Timeline Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bubble Timeline Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),

            items: [
              TimelineItem(
                title: 'Event 1',
                description: 'Description of Event 1',
                date: '2024-01-01',
                icon: Icons.event,
              ),
              TimelineItem(
                title: 'Event 2',
                description: 'Description of Event 2',
                date: '2024-02-01',
                icon: Icons.event,
              ),
              TimelineItem(
                title: 'Event 3',
                description: 'Description of Event 3',
                date: '2024-03-01',
                icon: Icons.event,
              ),
            ],
            bubbleColor: Colors.blue,
            lineColor: Colors.grey,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of a BubbleTimeline widget, which displays a vertical timeline.
// 5. The BubbleTimeline is populated with TimelineItem objects, each representing an event.
// 6. Each TimelineItem has a title, description, date, and an icon.
// 7. The bubbleColor and lineColor properties customize the appearance of the timeline.
