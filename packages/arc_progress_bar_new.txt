# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using arc_progress_bar_new

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `arc_progress_bar_new` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  arc_progress_bar_new: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the arc progress bar in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:arc_progress_bar_new/arc_progress_bar_new.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Arc Progress Bar Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ArcProgressBar(
            progress: 0.7, // Set progress value between 0.0 and 1.0
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
            foregroundColor: Colors.blue,
            strokeWidth: 10.0,
            animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 1),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays an arc progress bar with 70% progress. You can customize the `progress`, `backgroundColor`, `foregroundColor`, `strokeWidth`, and `animationDuration` properties to fit your design needs.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `arc_progress_bar_new` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of arc_progress_bar_new

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:arc_progress_bar_new/arc_progress_bar_new.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Arc Progress Bar Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ArcProgressBar(
            progress: 0.7, // Set progress value between 0.0 and 1.0
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color of the arc
            foregroundColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the progress arc
            strokeWidth: 10.0, // Width of the arc stroke
            animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Duration of the animation
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the basic structure for the app.
3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which includes an AppBar and a body.
4. The AppBar displays the title "Arc Progress Bar Example".
5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child widget.
6. The child widget is an ArcProgressBar, which is configured to show 70% progress.
7. The ArcProgressBar is styled with a grey background, blue foreground, a stroke width of 10.0, and an animation duration of 1 second.
8. When the app runs, the arc progress bar animates to 70% completion, providing a visual representation of progress.
