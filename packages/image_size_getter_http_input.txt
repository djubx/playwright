# Overview of the `image_size_getter_http_input` Flutter Package

The `image_size_getter_http_input` package is a specialized Flutter library designed to retrieve the dimensions of images from HTTP sources without downloading the entire image. This package is particularly useful for applications that need to display images dynamically, such as social media apps, image galleries, or any app that relies on user-generated content.

## When to Use This Package
- **Dynamic Image Loading**: When you need to load images from a URL and want to know their dimensions before displaying them.
- **Performance Optimization**: To avoid unnecessary data usage by not downloading large images when only their dimensions are needed.
- **Responsive Design**: To adjust UI elements based on the size of the images being loaded.

## Key Features
- **HTTP Support**: Fetches image dimensions directly from HTTP URLs.
- **Lightweight**: Only retrieves the necessary metadata, minimizing data usage.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.

Overall, `image_size_getter_http_input` is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to optimize image handling in their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `image_size_getter_http_input`

## Installation
To use the `image_size_getter_http_input` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_size_getter_http_input: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/image_size_getter_http_input).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the necessary permissions set in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing images from the internet. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
To use the package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:image_size_getter_http_input/image_size_getter_http_input.dart';
```

You can then use the `ImageSizeGetter` class to fetch the dimensions of an image from a URL. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void getImageSize(String url) async {
  final size = await ImageSizeGetter.getSize(url);
  print('Width: ${size.width}, Height: ${size.height}');
}
```

This function will print the width and height of the image located at the specified URL.

# Complete Example of Using `image_size_getter_http_input`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_size_getter_http_input/image_size_getter_http_input.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Size Getter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Image Size Getter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<Size>(
            // Fetching image size from a URL
            future: getImageSize('https://example.com/image.jpg'),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                // While waiting for the image size, show a loading indicator
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                // If there was an error fetching the image size, display an error message
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                // Once the size is retrieved, display the dimensions
                final size = snapshot.data!;
                return Text('Width: ${size.width}, Height: ${size.height}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to get the image size from a URL
  Future<Size> getImageSize(String url) async {
    // Using the ImageSizeGetter to fetch the size
    final size = await ImageSizeGetter.getSize(url);
    return size; // Return the size to the FutureBuilder
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, a FutureBuilder is used to fetch the image size asynchronously.
// 4. The getImageSize function is called with a URL, which uses the ImageSizeGetter to retrieve the dimensions.
// 5. While waiting for the image size, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 6. If an error occurs, an error message is shown.
// 7. Once the size is retrieved, it is displayed in the center of the screen.
```
