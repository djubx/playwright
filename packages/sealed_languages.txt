Here's a detailed technical blog on the "sealed_languages" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Sealed Languages Flutter Package

The `sealed_languages` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for the creation of sealed classes, which are a way to define a restricted class hierarchy. This package is particularly useful when you want to represent a fixed set of types, making your code more robust and easier to maintain. 

## When to Use `sealed_languages`

You might consider using the `sealed_languages` package in scenarios such as:

- **State Management**: When managing different states in your application, sealed classes can help you define all possible states explicitly.
- **API Responses**: When dealing with API responses that can have multiple formats, sealed classes can help you handle each response type cleanly.
- **Form Validation**: When validating forms with multiple possible outcomes, sealed classes can represent each validation state.

## Features

- **Type Safety**: Ensures that only defined types can be used, reducing runtime errors.
- **Pattern Matching**: Allows for easy handling of different types using pattern matching.
- **Code Generation**: Automatically generates the necessary boilerplate code for sealed classes, saving time and effort.

By leveraging the `sealed_languages` package, developers can create more maintainable and understandable codebases.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Sealed Languages Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `sealed_languages` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sealed_languages: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Code Generation

After adding the dependency, you need to run the code generation command. This is crucial as it generates the necessary files for your sealed classes.

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now create sealed classes in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to define a sealed class:

```dart
import 'package:sealed_languages/sealed_languages.dart';

part 'language_sealed.g.dart';

@Sealed()
abstract class Language {
  const Language();
}

class English extends Language {
  const English();
}

class Spanish extends Language {
  const Spanish();
}
```

In this example, we define a sealed class `Language` with two subclasses: `English` and `Spanish`. You can now use these classes in your application to represent different languages.

# Complete Example of Using Sealed Languages

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sealed_languages/sealed_languages.dart';

part 'language_sealed.g.dart';

// Define a sealed class for Language
@Sealed()
abstract class Language {
  const Language();
}

// Subclasses for different languages
class English extends Language {
  const English();
}

class Spanish extends Language {
  const Spanish();
}

// Main application class
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sealed Languages Example',
      home: LanguageSelector(),
    );
  }
}

// Widget to select a language
class LanguageSelector extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LanguageSelectorState createState() => _LanguageSelectorState();
}

class _LanguageSelectorState extends State<LanguageSelector> {
  Language _selectedLanguage = const English(); // Default language

  // Method to change the selected language
  void _changeLanguage(Language language) {
    setState(() {
      _selectedLanguage = language; // Update the selected language
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Select Language'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          // Button to select English
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () => _changeLanguage(const English()),
            child: Text('Select English'),
          ),
          // Button to select Spanish
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () => _changeLanguage(const Spanish()),
            child: Text('Select Spanish'),
          ),
          // Display the selected language
          Text('Selected Language: ${_selectedLanguage.runtimeType}'),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The LanguageSelector widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. The user can select either English or Spanish by pressing the respective buttons.
// 4. When a button is pressed, the _changeLanguage method is called, updating the state.
// 5. The selected language is displayed on the screen, showing the type of the selected language.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that allows users to select a language. The application uses the `sealed_languages` package to define a sealed class `Language` with two subclasses: `English` and `Spanish`. 

### Application Flow Summary

- The application starts with the `MyApp` class, which initializes the `MaterialApp`.
- The `LanguageSelector` widget is displayed, allowing users to select a language.
- When a user selects a language, the `_changeLanguage` method updates the state, and the selected language is displayed on the screen.
- The use of sealed classes ensures that only the defined languages can be selected, enhancing type safety and maintainability.

This structured approach to using the `sealed_languages` package demonstrates its capabilities and provides a clear path for developers to implement sealed classes in their Flutter applications.
