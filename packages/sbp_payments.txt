    final result = await SbpPayments.startPayment(paymentRequest);
    
    // Handle the payment result
    if (result.isSuccess) {
        print('Payment successful: ${result.transactionId}');
    } else {

# Complete Example of sbp_payments in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sbp_payments/sbp_payments.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SBP Payments Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SBP Payments'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            initiatePayment();
          },
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void initiatePayment() async {
    // Create a payment request
    final paymentRequest = PaymentRequest(
      amount: 1000, // Amount in the smallest currency unit
      currency: 'RUB', // Currency code
      description: 'Payment for order #1234',
    );

    // Start the payment process
    final result = await SbpPayments.startPayment(paymentRequest);
    
    // Handle the payment result
    if (result.isSuccess) {
      // Payment was successful
      print('Payment successful: ${result.transactionId}');
    } else {
      // Payment failed
      print('Payment failed: ${result.errorMessage}');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (PaymentScreen).
// 3. PaymentScreen contains a button labeled "Pay Now".
// 4. When the button is pressed, the initiatePayment function is called.
// 5. Inside initiatePayment, a PaymentRequest is created with the amount, currency, and description.
// 6. The payment process is initiated using SbpPayments.startPayment().
// 7. The result of the payment is checked; if successful, the transaction ID is printed, otherwise, the error message is printed.
