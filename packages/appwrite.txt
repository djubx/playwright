# Appwrite Flutter Package

## Overview
The Appwrite Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to integrate Appwrite's backend services into their Flutter applications seamlessly. Appwrite is an open-source backend server that provides a wide range of features, including user authentication, database management, file storage, and real-time capabilities. This package simplifies the process of connecting your Flutter app to Appwrite's services, enabling developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about backend complexities.

### When to Use Appwrite
- **Rapid Development**: When you need to quickly prototype an application with a robust backend.
- **User Management**: If your app requires user authentication and management features.
- **Real-time Applications**: For applications that need real-time data synchronization, such as chat apps or collaborative tools.
- **File Storage**: When your app needs to handle file uploads and downloads efficiently.

### Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Easily manage user sign-up, login, and session management.
- **Database Management**: Create, read, update, and delete documents in a NoSQL database.
- **File Storage**: Upload and manage files with ease.
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Listen to changes in your database in real-time.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

## Conclusion
The Appwrite Flutter package is an excellent choice for developers looking to integrate a powerful backend into their Flutter applications. Its rich feature set and ease of use make it a go-to solution for many app development scenarios.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Appwrite in Flutter

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the Appwrite package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  appwrite: ^0.8.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure Appwrite
### Android Configuration
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following lines to allow Appwrite to communicate over the network:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Initialize Appwrite
In your main Dart file, initialize the Appwrite client:

```dart
import 'package:appwrite/appwrite.dart';

void main() {
  Client client = Client();
  client
      .setEndpoint('https://[YOUR_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT]') // Your Appwrite Endpoint
      .setProject('[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]'); // Your project ID
}
```

## Step 4: Using Appwrite Services
You can now use various Appwrite services, such as authentication and database management. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to sign up a user:

```dart
import 'package:appwrite/appwrite.dart';

void signUpUser(String email, String password) async {
  final account = Account(client);
  try {
    final user = await account.create(
      userId: 'unique()',
      email: email,
      password: password,
    );
    print('User created: ${user.id}');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error: $e');
  }
}
```

## Conclusion
With these steps, you have successfully set up the Appwrite Flutter package in your application. You can now explore its features and integrate them into your app as needed.

# Complete Example: Appwrite Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appwrite/appwrite.dart';
import 'package:appwrite/models.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Appwrite Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// Home page widget
class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  final Client client = Client();
  final Account account;
  String message = '';

  _HomePageState() : account = Account(Client());

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Appwrite client
    client
        .setEndpoint('https://[YOUR_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT]') // Your Appwrite Endpoint
        .setProject('[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]'); // Your project ID
  }

  // Function to sign up a user
  void signUpUser(String email, String password) async {
    try {
      final user = await account.create(
        userId: 'unique()',
        email: email,
        password: password,
      );
      setState(() {
        message = 'User created: ${user.id}';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        message = 'Error: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Appwrite Flutter Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(message),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Call signUpUser with example credentials
                signUpUser('test@example.com', 'password123');
              },
              child: Text('Sign Up User'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, setting HomePage as the home widget.
3. HomePage initializes the Appwrite client in initState() and sets the endpoint and project ID.
4. The UI consists of a Text widget to display messages and a button to trigger user sign-up.
5. When the button is pressed, signUpUser() is called with example credentials.
6. If the user is created successfully, the message is updated to show the user ID; otherwise, it displays an error.
