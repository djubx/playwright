# Keyboard Detection in Flutter with `keyboard_detection` Package

The `keyboard_detection` package in Flutter is a powerful tool designed to help developers detect the visibility of the keyboard in their applications. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where the UI needs to adjust dynamically based on the keyboard's presence, such as when input fields are obscured by the keyboard or when you want to animate UI elements in response to keyboard events.

## When to Use `keyboard_detection`

- **Form Handling**: Adjust the layout when the keyboard appears to ensure input fields are visible.
- **Chat Applications**: Move chat input fields above the keyboard for better user experience.
- **Custom Animations**: Trigger animations when the keyboard is shown or hidden.

## Features

- **Keyboard Visibility Detection**: Easily determine if the keyboard is currently visible.
- **Event Listeners**: Listen for keyboard show and hide events to trigger UI updates.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Setting Up and Using `keyboard_detection` in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `keyboard_detection` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `keyboard_detection` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     keyboard_detection: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**: The `keyboard_detection` package does not require any additional platform-specific setup, making it straightforward to integrate into your project.

## Using the Package

To use the `keyboard_detection` package, you need to import it into your Dart file and utilize its functionality to detect keyboard visibility.

```dart
import 'package:keyboard_detection/keyboard_detection.dart';
```

### Basic Usage

- **Detect Keyboard Visibility**: Use the `KeyboardVisibilityProvider` to wrap your widget tree and access the keyboard visibility status.

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return KeyboardVisibilityProvider(
      child: Builder(
        builder: (context) {
          final isKeyboardVisible = KeyboardVisibilityProvider.isKeyboardVisible(context);
          return Text(isKeyboardVisible ? 'Keyboard is visible' : 'Keyboard is hidden');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example: Flutter Application with `keyboard_detection`

Below is a complete Flutter application demonstrating the use of the `keyboard_detection` package. This example shows how to detect keyboard visibility and adjust the UI accordingly.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:keyboard_detection/keyboard_detection.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Keyboard Detection Example'),
        ),
        body: KeyboardVisibilityProvider(
          child: KeyboardAwareWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class KeyboardAwareWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Access the keyboard visibility status
    final isKeyboardVisible = KeyboardVisibilityProvider.isKeyboardVisible(context);

    return Center(
      child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: <Widget>[
          Text(
            'Keyboard is ${isKeyboardVisible ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          TextField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Enter text',
              border: OutlineInputBorder(),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The `main` function initializes the app by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// `RealFlutter` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// The `KeyboardVisibilityProvider` wraps the `KeyboardAwareWidget` to provide keyboard visibility context.
// `KeyboardAwareWidget` checks if the keyboard is visible and updates the UI accordingly.
// The UI consists of a text widget displaying the keyboard status and a text field for user input.
