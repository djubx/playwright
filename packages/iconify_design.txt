# Complete Example of Using iconify_design

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iconify_design/iconify_design.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Iconify Design Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Iconify Design Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a home icon
            Iconify(
              'mdi:home',
              size: 50,
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Displaying a settings icon
            Iconify(
              'mdi:settings',
              size: 50,
              color: Colors.green,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Displaying a user icon
            Iconify(
              'mdi:account',
              size: 50,
              color: Colors.red,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. HomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 5. The Column displays three Iconify widgets, each representing a different icon (home, settings, account).
// 6. Each icon is customized with size and color, demonstrating the flexibility of the iconify_design package.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

### Summary of Application Flow

The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget. This widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with a title and theme. The `HomePage` widget is defined as the home screen, which contains an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget. Inside the center, a `Column` is used to display three different icons using the `Iconify` widget, showcasing the package's ability to render various icons with customizable properties. Each icon is spaced out using `SizedBox` for better visual separation. This example effectively demonstrates how to integrate and utilize the `iconify_design` package in a Flutter application.
