# Setup and Usage Tutorial for flutter_launch_store

## Installation
To use the `flutter_launch_store` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_launch_store: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launch_store).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entry to allow your app to open URLs:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>itms-apps</string>
</array>
```

## Using the Package
To launch the app store page, you can use the following code snippet:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_launch_store/flutter_launch_store.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Launch Store Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Launch the app store page
              FlutterLaunchStore.launchStore(
                appStoreId: 'YOUR_APP_STORE_ID', // Replace with your App Store ID
                appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID', // Replace with your Google Play ID
              );
            },
            child: Text('Open App Store'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, replace `YOUR_APP_STORE_ID` and `YOUR_APP_ID` with your actual app identifiers for iOS and Android, respectively.

With this setup, when the button is pressed, the app will navigate to the app store page for your application.

# Complete Example of flutter_launch_store

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_launch_store/flutter_launch_store.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Launch Store Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Launch the app store page
              FlutterLaunchStore.launchStore(
                appStoreId: 'YOUR_APP_STORE_ID', // Replace with your App Store ID
                appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID', // Replace with your Google Play ID
              );
            },
            child: Text('Open App Store'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the app's visual structure, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers the onPressed callback.
// 6. Inside the onPressed callback, the FlutterLaunchStore.launchStore method is called.
// 7. This method takes two parameters: appStoreId for iOS and appId for Android, which should be replaced with actual values.
// 8. When the button is pressed, the app store page for the application will open, allowing users to leave reviews or download the app.
