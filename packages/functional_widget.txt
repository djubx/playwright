Here's a detailed technical blog on the "functional_widget" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Functional Widget Flutter Package

The `functional_widget` package is a powerful tool in the Flutter ecosystem that allows developers to create widgets using a functional programming style. This package simplifies the process of building widgets by enabling the use of functions to define widget structures, which can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `functional_widget` package in the following scenarios:

- **Simplifying Widget Creation**: When you want to reduce boilerplate code associated with creating Stateful or Stateless widgets.
- **Improving Readability**: If you prefer a functional programming style that can make your widget definitions more concise and easier to read.
- **Reusable Components**: When you need to create reusable components that can be easily shared across different parts of your application.

## Features

- **Functional Syntax**: Allows you to define widgets using a functional approach, making it easier to manage state and props.
- **Code Generation**: Utilizes code generation to create the necessary widget classes, reducing manual coding errors.
- **Integration with Flutter**: Seamlessly integrates with existing Flutter projects, allowing you to mix functional and traditional widget definitions.

Overall, the `functional_widget` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter development experience with a functional programming paradigm.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Functional Widget Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `functional_widget` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  functional_widget: ^0.5.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Configuring Code Generation

The `functional_widget` package relies on code generation, so you need to set up the build runner. Add the following dev dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.0.0
  functional_widget: ^0.5.0
```

## Step 3: Creating a Functional Widget

Now, let's create a simple functional widget. Create a new Dart file, for example, `my_widget.dart`, and define your widget as follows:

```dart
import 'package:functional_widget/functional_widget.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

part 'my_widget.g.dart'; // This is necessary for code generation

@swidget
Widget myWidget(String title) {
  return Text(title);
}
```

## Step 4: Running Code Generation

To generate the necessary code, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This command will create a file named `my_widget.g.dart` that contains the generated widget class.

## Step 5: Using Your Functional Widget

You can now use your functional widget in your main application file. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'my_widget.dart'; // Import your functional widget

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Functional Widget Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: myWidget('Hello, Functional Widget!'), // Use the functional widget
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target in `ios/Podfile` is set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

After making these changes, run `flutter clean` and then `flutter pub get` to ensure everything is set up correctly.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `functional_widget` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the Functional Widget Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:functional_widget/functional_widget.dart';

part 'main.g.dart'; // Necessary for code generation

@swidget
Widget myButton(String label, VoidCallback onPressed) {
  return ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: onPressed,
    child: Text(label),
  );
}

@swidget
Widget myText(String text) {
  return Text(
    text,
    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
  );
}

@swidget
Widget myApp() {
  return MaterialApp(
    home: Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: myText('Functional Widget Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: myButton('Click Me', () {
          // Action when button is pressed
          print('Button Pressed!');
        }),
      ),
    ),
  );
}

void main() {
  runApp(myApp()); // Start the application with the functional widget
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. It calls runApp with the myApp widget, which is defined as a functional widget.
// 3. myApp returns a MaterialApp widget, which sets up the app's structure.
// 4. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which provides the app's basic visual layout.
// 5. The AppBar displays a title using the myText functional widget.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 7. The child of the Center is a button created using the myButton functional widget.
// 8. When the button is pressed, it triggers a print statement to the console.
```
