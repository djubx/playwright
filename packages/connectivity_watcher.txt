Here's a detailed technical blog on the "connectivity_watcher" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Connectivity Watcher Flutter Package

The **connectivity_watcher** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for real-time monitoring of network connectivity changes. This package is particularly useful in applications that require a stable internet connection, such as chat applications, streaming services, or any app that relies on real-time data.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **connectivity_watcher** package in scenarios where:

- You need to detect changes in network connectivity (e.g., switching from Wi-Fi to mobile data).
- Your application requires a reliable connection to function properly and needs to inform users when connectivity is lost.
- You want to implement features that depend on the network state, such as retrying failed requests when connectivity is restored.

## Features

- **Real-time Connectivity Monitoring**: Automatically detects changes in network status.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Custom Callbacks**: Allows developers to define custom actions when connectivity changes.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and usage within your Flutter application.

With these features, the **connectivity_watcher** package provides a robust solution for managing network connectivity in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Connectivity Watcher

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **connectivity_watcher** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  connectivity_watcher: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/connectivity_watcher).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement connectivity monitoring.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:connectivity_watcher/connectivity_watcher.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and set up the connectivity listener:

```dart
class RealFlutter {
  final ConnectivityWatcher _connectivityWatcher = ConnectivityWatcher();

  void init() {
    _connectivityWatcher.onConnectivityChanged.listen((ConnectivityResult result) {
      // Handle connectivity changes
      if (result == ConnectivityResult.mobile) {
        print("Connected to Mobile Network");
      } else if (result == ConnectivityResult.wifi) {
        print("Connected to Wi-Fi");
      } else {
        print("No Internet Connection");
      }
    });
  }
}
```

3. Call the `init` method in your main application to start monitoring connectivity.

With these steps, you can effectively monitor network connectivity in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Connectivity Watcher

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:connectivity_watcher/connectivity_watcher.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Connectivity Watcher Demo',
      home: ConnectivityHome(),
    );
  }
}

class ConnectivityHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ConnectivityHomeState createState() => _ConnectivityHomeState();
}

class _ConnectivityHomeState extends State<ConnectivityHome> {
  final ConnectivityWatcher _connectivityWatcher = ConnectivityWatcher();
  String _connectionStatus = "Unknown";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the connectivity watcher
    _connectivityWatcher.onConnectivityChanged.listen((ConnectivityResult result) {
      // Update the connection status based on the result
      setState(() {
        if (result == ConnectivityResult.mobile) {
          _connectionStatus = "Connected to Mobile Network";
        } else if (result == ConnectivityResult.wifi) {
          _connectionStatus = "Connected to Wi-Fi";
        } else {
          _connectionStatus = "No Internet Connection";
        }
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Connectivity Watcher Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _connectionStatus,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the connectivity watcher when the widget is removed
    _connectivityWatcher.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to ConnectivityHome.
// 3. In ConnectivityHome, we initialize the ConnectivityWatcher and listen for connectivity changes.
// 4. When the connectivity changes, we update the _connectionStatus variable and rebuild the UI to reflect the current connection status.
// 5. The current connection status is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, we ensure to dispose of the connectivity watcher to free up resources.
```

In this blog, we explored the **connectivity_watcher** Flutter package, detailing its features, setup process, and providing a complete example. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the connectivity watcher, listens for changes, and updates the UI accordingly. This package is essential for any Flutter application that requires reliable network connectivity management.
