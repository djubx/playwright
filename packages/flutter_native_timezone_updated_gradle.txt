# flutter_native_timezone_updated_gradle Package Overview

The `flutter_native_timezone_updated_gradle` package is a Flutter plugin that provides a way to retrieve the native timezone of the device on which the Flutter application is running. This package is particularly useful for applications that require timezone-aware functionalities, such as scheduling events, displaying local times, or managing time-sensitive data across different regions.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_native_timezone_updated_gradle` package in scenarios such as:

- **Event Scheduling**: When your app needs to schedule events based on the user's local timezone.
- **Time Display**: If your application displays times that need to be adjusted according to the user's timezone.
- **Data Management**: For applications that manage data across different time zones, ensuring that timestamps are correctly interpreted.

## Features

- **Native Timezone Retrieval**: Access the device's native timezone directly.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and usage within your Flutter application.

By leveraging this package, developers can ensure that their applications handle time-related data accurately and efficiently, enhancing the user experience across different regions.

# Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `flutter_native_timezone_updated_gradle` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_native_timezone_updated_gradle: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update Gradle Files**: Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file includes the necessary configurations. You may need to update the `minSdkVersion` to at least 21.

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Permissions**: No special permissions are required for this package, but ensure your app has internet access if you plan to fetch timezone data from a remote source.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing location services to determine the timezone.

   ```xml
   <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires access to your location to determine the timezone.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to retrieve the native timezone:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_native_timezone_updated_gradle/flutter_native_timezone_updated_gradle.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Native Timezone Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<String>(
            future: _getNativeTimezone(),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                return Text('Native Timezone: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<String> _getNativeTimezone() async {
    // Retrieve the native timezone using the package
    final String timezone = await FlutterNativeTimezone.getLocalTimezone();
    return timezone;
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays the device's native timezone. The `FutureBuilder` widget is used to handle the asynchronous call to retrieve the timezone.

# Complete Example of flutter_native_timezone_updated_gradle

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_native_timezone_updated_gradle/flutter_native_timezone_updated_gradle.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Native Timezone Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<String>(
            future: _getNativeTimezone(),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              // Check the connection state of the Future
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                // While waiting for the result, show a loading indicator
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                // If there was an error, display it
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                // Once the timezone is retrieved, display it
                return Text('Native Timezone: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<String> _getNativeTimezone() async {
    // Retrieve the native timezone using the package
    final String timezone = await FlutterNativeTimezone.getLocalTimezone();
    return timezone; // Return the retrieved timezone
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget as the main entry point.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, which sets up the app's theme and navigation.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to provide a structure for the app, including an AppBar and body.
// 4. In the body, a FutureBuilder is used to handle the asynchronous operation of fetching the timezone.
// 5. The _getNativeTimezone method is called, which uses the flutter_native_timezone_updated_gradle package to get the device's timezone.
// 6. While waiting for the result, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 7. If an error occurs during the fetch, it is displayed on the screen.
// 8. Once the timezone is successfully retrieved, it is displayed in the center of the screen.
```
