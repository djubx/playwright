# Tutorial: Setting Up the `introduction_screen` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `introduction_screen` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  introduction_screen: ^2.1.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `introduction_screen` in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:introduction_screen/introduction_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Introduction Screen Demo',
      home: OnboardingScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class OnboardingScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // This method builds the individual pages of the introduction screen
  Widget buildPage(String title, String body, String image) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Image.asset(image, height: 250), // Display the image
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        Text(title, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)), // Title
        SizedBox(height: 10),
        Text(body, textAlign: TextAlign.center), // Body text
      ],
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return IntroductionScreen(
      pages: [
        PageViewModel(
          title: "Welcome to RealFlutter",
          body: "This is an introduction to our app.",
          image: buildPage("Welcome", "This is an introduction to our app.", "assets/welcome.png"),
        ),
        PageViewModel(
          title: "Features",
          body: "Discover amazing features.",
          image: buildPage("Features", "Discover amazing features.", "assets/features.png"),
        ),
        PageViewModel(
          title: "Get Started",
          body: "Let's get started!",
          image: buildPage("Get Started", "Let's get started!", "assets/get_started.png"),
        ),
      ],
      onDone: () {
        // When the user presses the done button
        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => HomeScreen()));
      },
      onSkip: () {
        // When the user presses the skip button
        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => HomeScreen()));
      },
      showSkipButton: true,
      skip: Text("Skip"),
      next: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),
      done: Text("Done", style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.w600)),
      dotsDecorator: DotsDecorator(
        activeColor: Colors.blue,
        color: Colors.grey,
        size: Size(10, 10),
        activeSize: Size(12, 12),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Home")),
      body: Center(child: Text("Welcome to the Home Screen!")),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp with the OnboardingScreen as the home.
// 3. The OnboardingScreen uses IntroductionScreen to display multiple pages.
// 4. Each page is created using PageViewModel, which includes a title, body, and image.
// 5. Users can navigate through the pages using the next button or skip to the end.
// 6. On pressing the done or skip button, the app navigates to the HomeScreen.
// 7. The HomeScreen displays a simple welcome message.
