# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_cupertino_bottom_sheet

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_cupertino_bottom_sheet` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_cupertino_bottom_sheet: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_cupertino_bottom_sheet/flutter_cupertino_bottom_sheet.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, ensure that your app's `Info.plist` file includes the following settings to support the bottom sheet's appearance:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

### Android Configuration
For Android, no specific configuration is required for the bottom sheet to function. However, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Bottom Sheet

You can now use the bottom sheet in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to trigger the bottom sheet:

```dart
void _showBottomSheet(BuildContext context) {
  showCupertinoModalBottomSheet(
    context: context,
    builder: (context) => Container(
      height: 300,
      color: Colors.white,
      child: Center(
        child: Text('Hello from the bottom sheet!'),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

You can call `_showBottomSheet(context)` from a button or any other widget to display the bottom sheet.

# Complete Example of flutter_cupertino_bottom_sheet

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_cupertino_bottom_sheet/flutter_cupertino_bottom_sheet.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cupertino Bottom Sheet Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Cupertino Bottom Sheet Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Call the function to show the bottom sheet
              _showBottomSheet(context);
            },
            child: Text('Show Bottom Sheet'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _showBottomSheet(BuildContext context) {
    // Display the Cupertino modal bottom sheet
    showCupertinoModalBottomSheet(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) => Container(
        height: 300, // Set the height of the bottom sheet
        color: Colors.white, // Background color of the bottom sheet
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Hello from the bottom sheet!', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20)),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Dismiss the bottom sheet when the button is pressed
                Navigator.pop(context);
              },
              child: Text('Close'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a simple Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget has an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, calls the _showBottomSheet function.
// 4. The _showBottomSheet function uses showCupertinoModalBottomSheet to display a bottom sheet with a height of 300 pixels.
// 5. The bottom sheet contains a Text widget and a Close button.
// 6. Pressing the Close button dismisses the bottom sheet by calling Navigator.pop(context).
```
