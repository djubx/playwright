# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_stripe_payment

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_stripe_payment` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_stripe_payment` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_stripe_payment: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure for Android

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Add Stripe API Key**: In the same file, add your Stripe publishable key in the `<application>` tag:

   ```xml
   <meta-data
       android:name="com.stripe.apiKey"
       android:value="your_publishable_key"/>
   ```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Add Stripe API Key**: Add your Stripe publishable key in the same file:

   ```xml
   <key>StripePublishableKey</key>
   <string>your_publishable_key</string>
   ```

## Step 4: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, initialize the Stripe payment package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_stripe_payment/flutter_stripe_payment.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  StripePayment.setOptions(StripeOptions(
    publishableKey: "your_publishable_key",
    merchantId: "Test",
    androidPayMode: 'test',
  ));
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Implement Payment Logic

You can now implement the payment logic in your application. Here’s a simple example of how to create a payment method and process a payment.

# Complete Example of flutter_stripe_payment

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_stripe_payment/flutter_stripe_payment.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize Stripe with your publishable key
  StripePayment.setOptions(StripeOptions(
    publishableKey: "your_publishable_key",
    merchantId: "Test",
    androidPayMode: 'test',
  ));
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stripe Payment Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  // Function to create a payment method
  void _createPaymentMethod() async {
    // Create a card payment method
    CreditCard card = CreditCard(
      number: '4242424242424242', // Test card number
      expMonth: 12,
      expYear: 23,
      cvc: '123',
    );

    // Create payment method
    try {
      PaymentMethod paymentMethod = await StripePayment.createPaymentMethod(
        PaymentMethodRequest(card: card),
      );

      // Process payment with the created payment method
      _processPayment(paymentMethod);
    } catch (error) {
      print("Error creating payment method: $error");
    }
  }

  // Function to process the payment
  void _processPayment(PaymentMethod paymentMethod) async {
    // Here you would typically send the paymentMethod.id to your server
    // to create a charge or a subscription
    print("Payment Method ID: ${paymentMethod.id}");
    // Simulate a successful payment
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Successful!')),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stripe Payment')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _createPaymentMethod,
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app initializes Stripe with the provided publishable key.
// 2. The main screen displays a button labeled "Pay Now."
// 3. When the button is pressed, the _createPaymentMethod function is called.
// 4. A test credit card is created, and a payment method is generated using Stripe's API.
// 5. If successful, the payment method ID is printed, and a success message is shown.
// 6. In a real application, you would send the payment method ID to your server to process the payment.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we demonstrated how to set up the `flutter_stripe_payment` package, create a payment method, and process a payment. The application flow is straightforward: initialize Stripe, create a payment method, and handle the payment process. This structure allows for easy integration of payment processing into your Flutter applications, providing a smooth user experience.
