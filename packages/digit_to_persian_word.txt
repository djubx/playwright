Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to use the `digit_to_persian_word` package in your app:

1. Import the package.
2. Call the conversion function with a number.
3. Display the result in your UI.

Here’s a basic implementation:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:digit_to_persian_word/digit_to_persian_word.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Digit to Persian Word')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            RealFlutter.convert(456), // Converts 456 to Persian words
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),

# Complete Example of Using the Digit to Persian Word Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:digit_to_persian_word/digit_to_persian_word.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Start the Flutter application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Digit to Persian Word Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Digit to Persian Word'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying the Persian word for 123
              Text(
                RealFlutter.convert(123), // Converts 123 to Persian words
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adds space between texts
              // Displaying the Persian word for 456
              Text(
                RealFlutter.convert(456), // Converts 456 to Persian words
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adds space between texts
              // Displaying the Persian word for 7890
              Text(
                RealFlutter.convert(7890), // Converts 7890 to Persian words
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the main structure of the app.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget provides the app with material design styling.
// 4. The Scaffold widget creates the basic visual layout structure, including an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 6. A Column widget is used to arrange multiple Text widgets vertically.
// 7. Each Text widget calls RealFlutter.convert() with different numbers (123, 456, 7890) to convert them to Persian words.
// 8. The converted Persian words are displayed on the screen with a font size of 24.
