# Overview of the `card_stack_widget` Flutter Package

The `card_stack_widget` Flutter package is a versatile and powerful tool designed to create interactive card stack interfaces. This package is particularly useful for applications that require a swipeable card interface, similar to those found in dating apps or task management tools. 

## When to Use

- **Dating Apps**: Implement swipeable profiles.
- **Task Management**: Organize tasks in a card format that users can swipe through.
- **Product Showcases**: Display products in a stack that users can swipe to explore.

## Features

- **Customizable Cards**: Easily customize the appearance of each card.
- **Swipe Gestures**: Built-in support for swipe gestures to navigate through the stack.
- **Animations**: Smooth animations for card transitions.
- **Callbacks**: Event callbacks for swipe actions, allowing developers to handle actions like liking or dismissing a card.

# Setting Up and Using the `card_stack_widget` Package

## Setup Process

To integrate the `card_stack_widget` package into your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package dependency.
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     card_stack_widget: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package.
   ```dart
   import 'package:card_stack_widget/card_stack_widget.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support the necessary animations.

### iOS

- No additional setup is required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher.

## Usage

To use the `card_stack_widget`, you need to create a `CardStack` widget and provide it with a list of cards. Each card can be customized with its own content and style.

```dart
CardStack(
  cards: [
    RealFlutterCard(content: Text('Card 1')),
    RealFlutterCard(content: Text('Card 2')),
    RealFlutterCard(content: Text('Card 3')),
  ],
  onSwipe: (direction, index) {
    print('Card $index swiped $direction');
  },
)
```

- **cards**: A list of `RealFlutterCard` widgets.
- **onSwipe**: A callback function that triggers when a card is swiped.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:card_stack_widget/card_stack_widget.dart';

void main() => runApp(RealFlutterApp());

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Card Stack Demo',
      home: CardStackDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class CardStackDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Card Stack Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CardStack(
          cards: _buildCardList(),
          onSwipe: (direction, index) {
            // Handle swipe direction and index
            print('Card $index swiped $direction');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  List<RealFlutterCard> _buildCardList() {
    // Create a list of cards with different content
    return [
      RealFlutterCard(content: _buildCardContent('Card 1')),
      RealFlutterCard(content: _buildCardContent('Card 2')),
      RealFlutterCard(content: _buildCardContent('Card 3')),
    ];
  }

  Widget _buildCardContent(String text) {
    // Define the content of each card
    return Container(
      width: 300,
      height: 400,
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: Colors.blueAccent,
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
      ),
      child: Center(
        child: Text(
          text,
          style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The `RealFlutterApp` is the entry point of the application, setting up the MaterialApp.
// 2. `CardStackDemo` is the main screen, displaying the card stack.
// 3. `_buildCardList` creates a list of `RealFlutterCard` widgets, each with unique content.
// 4. `_buildCardContent` defines the appearance of each card.
// 5. The `CardStack` widget handles the display and swipe interactions of the cards.
// 6. The `onSwipe` callback is triggered whenever a card is swiped, logging the action.
