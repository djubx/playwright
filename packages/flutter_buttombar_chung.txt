```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle

# Complete Example of flutter_buttombar_chung

Here is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `flutter_buttombar_chung` package. This example demonstrates how to implement a bottom navigation bar with three tabs.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_buttombar_chung/flutter_buttombar_chung.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to keep track of the selected index
  int _selectedIndex = 0;

  // List of widgets to display for each tab
  final List<Widget> _widgetOptions = <Widget>[
    Center(child: Text('Home')),
    Center(child: Text('Search')),
    Center(child: Text('Profile')),
  ];

  // Function to handle tab changes
  void _onItemTapped(int index) {
    setState(() {
      _selectedIndex = index; // Update the selected index
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bottom Bar Chung Example'),
        ),
        body: _widgetOptions.elementAt(_selectedIndex), // Display the selected widget
        bottomNavigationBar: BottomBarChung(
          currentIndex: _selectedIndex, // Set the current index
          onTap: _onItemTapped, // Handle tap events
          items: [
            BottomBarItem(icon: Icons.home, label: 'Home'),
            BottomBarItem(icon: Icons.search, label: 'Search'),
            BottomBarItem(icon: Icons.person, label: 'Profile'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected tab.
// 3. The _selectedIndex variable keeps track of which tab is currently selected.
// 4. The _widgetOptions list contains the widgets to display for each tab.
// 5. The _onItemTapped function updates the selected index when a tab is tapped.
// 6. The build method constructs the UI, including the AppBar, body, and BottomBarChung.
// 7. The BottomBarChung widget displays the bottom navigation bar with three items.
// 8. When a user taps on a tab, the corresponding widget is displayed in the body.
