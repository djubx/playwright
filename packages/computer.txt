# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Computer Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **computer** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **computer** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  computer: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the **computer** package as follows:

```dart
import 'package:computer/computer.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the features of the **computer** package in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to perform a calculation:

```dart
void main() {
  var result = RealFlutter.calculate(5, 10);
  print('The result is: $result');
}
```

This example demonstrates a basic calculation using the `calculate` method from the `RealFlutter` class.

With these steps, you are now ready to utilize the **computer** package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of Using the Computer Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:computer/computer.dart'; // Importing the computer package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Starting the Flutter application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Computer Package Example',
      home: HomeScreen(), // Setting the home screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  double _result = 0; // Variable to store the result

  // Method to perform calculation
  void _performCalculation() {
    // Using the RealFlutter class to calculate the sum of two numbers
    _result = RealFlutter.calculate(5, 10);
    setState(() {}); // Updating the UI with the new result
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Computer Package Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Result: $_result', // Displaying the result
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _performCalculation, // Button to trigger calculation
              child: Text('Calculate'), // Button label
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp and sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the result.
// 4. When the user presses the 'Calculate' button, _performCalculation() is called.
// 5. Inside _performCalculation(), the RealFlutter.calculate method is invoked to perform the calculation.
// 6. The result is stored in the _result variable, and setState() is called to update the UI.
// 7. The updated result is displayed on the screen.
```
