# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the OpenFoodFacts Flutter Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the OpenFoodFacts package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  openfoodfacts: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

2. Make sure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart files, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the package to search for products and retrieve their details. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to search for a product by its barcode:

```dart
void searchProduct(String barcode) async {
  final ProductQueryConfiguration configuration = ProductQueryConfiguration(
    barcode: barcode,
    countryCode: 'en',
    language: 'en',
  );

  final ProductResult result = await OpenFoodAPIClient.getProduct(configuration);
  
  if (result.status == 1) {
    // Product found
    print('Product Name: ${result.product!.productName}');
  } else {
    // Handle product not found
    print('Product not found');
  }
}
```

This function searches for a product using its barcode and prints the product name if found.

# Complete Example: OpenFoodFacts Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'OpenFoodFacts Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.green,
      ),
      home: ProductSearchScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ProductSearchScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ProductSearchScreenState createState() => _ProductSearchScreenState();
}

class _ProductSearchScreenState extends State<ProductSearchScreen> {
  String _barcode = '';
  String _productName = '';

  // Function to search for a product by barcode
  void _searchProduct() async {
    final ProductQueryConfiguration configuration = ProductQueryConfiguration(
      barcode: _barcode,
      countryCode: 'en',
      language: 'en',
    );

    final ProductResult result = await OpenFoodAPIClient.getProduct(configuration);
    
    // Check if the product was found
    if (result.status == 1) {
      setState(() {
        _productName = result.product!.productName ?? 'No name found';
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _productName = 'Product not found';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('OpenFoodFacts Product Search'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter Barcode'),
              onChanged: (value) {
                _barcode = value; // Update barcode as user types
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _searchProduct, // Trigger product search
              child: Text('Search Product'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              _productName, // Display product name or not found message
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to ProductSearchScreen, which contains a text field and a button.
// 4. When the user enters a barcode and presses the button, the _searchProduct function is called.
// 5. This function queries the OpenFoodFacts API for the product using the entered barcode.
// 6. If the product is found, its name is displayed; otherwise, a "Product not found" message is shown.
```
