# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Image Collage Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `image_collage` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_collage: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create an image collage.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_collage/image_collage.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Collage Example',
      home: CollageScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CollageScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample images to be used in the collage
    final List<String> imageUrls = [
      'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
      'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
      'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
      'https://example.com/image4.jpg',
    ];

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Collage'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ImageCollage(
          // The list of images to be displayed in the collage
          images: imageUrls,
          // The number of columns in the collage
          columns: 2,
          // The spacing between images
          spacing: 4.0,
          // The border radius for each image
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8.0),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (CollageScreen).
// 3. CollageScreen creates a list of image URLs to be used in the collage.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a basic structure with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The ImageCollage widget is used to create the collage, taking the list of images,
//    number of columns, spacing, and border radius as parameters.
// 6. The collage is displayed in the center of the screen, providing a visually appealing layout.
