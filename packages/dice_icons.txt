**Setting Up and Using the Dice Icons Package**
=============================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec.yaml File

To use the `dice_icons` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dice_icons: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Import the Package in Your Dart File

After adding the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file, you need to import it in your Dart file. Add the following line at the top of your Dart file:

```

### Step 3: Use the Dice Icons in Your Flutter App

```dart
DiceIcon(

  dice: DiceIcons.dice1,
)
```

This will display a blue dice icon with a size of 50.
