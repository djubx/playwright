import 'package:simple_vertical_calendar/simple_vertical_calendar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Vertical Calendar Demo',
      home: CalendarHome(),
    );
  }
}

class CalendarHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CalendarHomeState createState() => _CalendarHomeState();
}

class _CalendarHomeState extends State<CalendarHome> {
  DateTime selectedDate = DateTime.now(); // Variable to hold the selected date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Simple Vertical Calendar'),
      ),
      body: Row(
        children: [
          // Vertical Calendar Widget
          Expanded(
            child: SimpleVerticalCalendar(
              onDateSelected: (date) {
                // Update the selected date when a date is tapped
                setState(() {
                  selectedDate = date;
                });
              },
              initialDate: DateTime.now(), // Set the initial date to today
              highlightedDates: [
                DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 1)), // Highlight tomorrow
              ],
            ),
          ),
          // Display the selected date
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Text(
                  'Selected Date:',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
                ),
                SizedBox(height: 10),
                Text(
                  '${selectedDate.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0], // Display the selected date
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the simple_vertical_calendar package.
// 
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home page.
// 3. The `CalendarHome` widget is a stateful widget that maintains the selected date.
// 4. Inside the `build` method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a body containing a Row.
// 5. The `SimpleVerticalCalendar` widget is placed inside an Expanded widget to take up available space.
// 6. The `onDateSelected` callback updates the `selectedDate` state when a date is tapped.
// 7. The selected date is displayed in a Text widget next to the calendar.
// 
// This application allows users to select a date from the vertical calendar and see their selection immediately reflected in the UI.
