# Tutorial: Setting Up the AppsFlyer SDK in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `appsflyer_sdk` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `appsflyer_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  appsflyer_sdk: ^6.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.appsflyer.sdk.appid"
            android:value="YOUR_APPSFLYER_DEV_KEY" />
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.appsflyer.sdk.host"
            android:value="YOUR_APPSFLYER_HOST" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **ProGuard Rules**: If you are using ProGuard, add the following rules to `proguard-rules.pro`:

```pro
-keep class com.appsflyer.** { *; }
-keep class com.appsflyer.sdk.** { *; }
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries:

```xml
<key>AppsFlyerDevKey</key>
<string>YOUR_APPSFLYER_DEV_KEY</string>
<key>AppID</key>
<string>YOUR_APP_ID</string>
```

2. **Enable Background Modes**: In Xcode, go to your project settings, select the "Capabilities" tab, and enable "Background Modes". Check "Remote notifications".

## Step 3: Initialize the SDK

In your main Dart file, initialize the AppsFlyer SDK:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appsflyer_sdk/appsflyer_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AppsFlyer Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final AppsFlyerSdk appsFlyerSdk = AppsFlyerSdk();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initAppsFlyer();
  }

  void _initAppsFlyer() async {
    // Initialize AppsFlyer SDK
    await appsFlyerSdk.initSdk(
      appsFlyerOptions: AppsFlyerOptions(
        afDevKey: 'YOUR_APPSFLYER_DEV_KEY',
        appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('AppsFlyer SDK Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to AppsFlyer Demo!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of AppsFlyer SDK in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appsflyer_sdk/appsflyer_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AppsFlyer Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of AppsFlyerSdk
  final AppsFlyerSdk appsFlyerSdk = AppsFlyerSdk();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initAppsFlyer(); // Call the initialization method
  }

  void _initAppsFlyer() async {
    // Initialize AppsFlyer SDK with your dev key and app ID
    await appsFlyerSdk.initSdk(
      appsFlyerOptions: AppsFlyerOptions(
        afDevKey: 'YOUR_APPSFLYER_DEV_KEY', // Replace with your AppsFlyer Dev Key
        appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID', // Replace with your App ID
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('AppsFlyer SDK Example'), // App title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to AppsFlyer Demo!'), // Main content
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with the title 'AppsFlyer Demo'.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget is set as the home of the MaterialApp.
// 4. In the RealFlutter widget, we create an instance of AppsFlyerSdk.
// 5. During the initialization phase (initState), we call _initAppsFlyer().
// 6. The _initAppsFlyer method initializes the AppsFlyer SDK with the developer key and app ID.
// 7. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered Text widget.
// 8. The app displays a welcome message to the user.
