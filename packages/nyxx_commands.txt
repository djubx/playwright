### Overview of "nyxx_commands"

The `nyxx_commands` package is a powerful tool designed for building command-based applications in Flutter, particularly for Discord bots. It provides a structured way to handle commands, making it easier to manage user interactions and responses. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to create interactive bots that can respond to user commands in a seamless manner.

### When to Use "nyxx_commands"

You should consider using `nyxx_commands` when:
- You are developing a Discord bot and need to handle multiple commands efficiently.
- You want to create a structured command system that can easily be extended or modified.
- You need to manage user input and provide dynamic responses based on commands.

### Key Features

- **Command Handling**: Easily define and manage commands with a simple syntax.
- **Argument Parsing**: Automatically parse command arguments and provide validation.
- **Middleware Support**: Implement middleware functions to handle pre- and post-processing of commands.
- **Context Management**: Access user context and command context seamlessly.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend the command system with custom commands and functionalities.

### Setup Process

To get started with the `nyxx_commands` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `nyxx_commands` package under dependencies.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     nyxx_commands: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/nyxx_commands).

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for internet access.
   - **iOS**: Update your `Info.plist` to include any required permissions for network access.

4. **Basic Configuration**: Initialize the `nyxx_commands` in your main application file. You will need to create a bot instance and set up command handling.

### Example Command Setup

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to set up a command using `nyxx_commands`:

```dart
import 'package:nyxx/nyxx.dart';
import 'package:nyxx_commands/nyxx_commands.dart';

void main() {
  final nyxx = NyxxFactory.createNyxxWebsocket('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN', GatewayIntents.allUnprivileged);
  final commands = CommandsPlugin(nyxx);

  // Register a simple command
  commands.addCommand(Command(
    name: 'hello',
    description: 'Responds with a greeting',
    callback: (context) {
      context.respond('Hello, ${context.user.username}!');
    },
  ));

  nyxx.connect();
}
```

In this example, we create a simple command that responds with a greeting when invoked.

## <-- START_MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:nyxx/nyxx.dart'; // Importing the nyxx package for Discord bot functionality
import 'package:nyxx_commands/nyxx_commands.dart'; // Importing the nyxx_commands package for command handling

void main() {
  // Creating a new instance of the Nyxx bot with the provided token
  final nyxx = NyxxFactory.createNyxxWebsocket('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN', GatewayIntents.allUnprivileged);
  
  // Initializing the CommandsPlugin to handle commands
  final commands = CommandsPlugin(nyxx);

  // Registering a simple command named 'hello'
  commands.addCommand(Command(
    name: 'hello', // The name of the command
    description: 'Responds with a greeting', // Description of the command
    callback: (context) { // The callback function that executes when the command is invoked
      context.respond('Hello, ${context.user.username}!'); // Responding to the user with a greeting
    },
  ));

  // Registering another command named 'ping'
  commands.addCommand(Command(
    name: 'ping', // The name of the command
    description: 'Responds with pong', // Description of the command
    callback: (context) { // The callback function for the command
      context.respond('Pong!'); // Responding with 'Pong' when the command is invoked
    },
  ));

  // Connecting the bot to Discord
  nyxx.connect();
}

/*
  Application Flow Explanation:
  1. The main function initializes the Discord bot using the provided token.
  2. The CommandsPlugin is created to manage commands.
  3. Two commands are registered: 'hello' and 'ping'.
  4. When a user types '!hello', the bot responds with a personalized greeting.
  5. When a user types '!ping', the bot responds with 'Pong'.
  6. Finally, the bot connects to Discord and starts listening for commands.
*/

### Summary of Application Flow

In this example, we created a simple Discord bot using the `nyxx_commands` package. The bot responds to two commands: `!hello` and `!ping`. When a user invokes the `!hello` command, the bot greets the user by name, while the `!ping` command returns a simple 'Pong' response. The application flow is straightforward, allowing for easy expansion with additional commands and functionalities as needed. 

This setup provides a solid foundation for building more complex command-based interactions in your Discord bot using Flutter.
