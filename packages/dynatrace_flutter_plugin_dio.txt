# Tutorial: Setting Up dynatrace_flutter_plugin_dio

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `dynatrace_flutter_plugin_dio` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `dynatrace_flutter_plugin_dio` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dio: ^5.0.0  # Ensure you have Dio as a dependency
  dynatrace_flutter_plugin_dio: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the necessary permissions and Dynatrace configuration:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <application>
        <!-- Add Dynatrace configuration here -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.dynatrace.sdk.appid"
            android:value="YOUR_APP_ID" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the necessary Dynatrace configuration:

```xml
<key>DTXAppID</key>
<string>YOUR_APP_ID</string>
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Plugin
In your main Dart file, initialize the Dynatrace plugin before making any network requests:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:dynatrace_flutter_plugin_dio/dynatrace_flutter_plugin_dio.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Dynatrace
  DynatraceFlutterPluginDio.initialize("YOUR_APP_ID");
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Plugin with Dio
You can now use the `Dio` client with Dynatrace monitoring. Hereâ€™s how to create a Dio instance and make a network request:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dynatrace Dio Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Create a Dio instance
              final dio = Dio();

              // Make a GET request
              try {
                final response = await dio.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
                print(response.data);
              } catch (e) {
                print('Error: $e');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Fetch Data'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up the `dynatrace_flutter_plugin_dio` package in your Flutter application. You can now monitor your network requests and gain insights into your app's performance.

# Complete Example of dynatrace_flutter_plugin_dio

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:dynatrace_flutter_plugin_dio/dynatrace_flutter_plugin_dio.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Dynatrace with your application ID
  DynatraceFlutterPluginDio.initialize("YOUR_APP_ID");
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dynatrace Dio Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Create a Dio instance for making HTTP requests
              final dio = Dio();

              // Make a GET request to fetch data
              try {
                final response = await dio.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
                // Print the response data to the console
                print(response.data);
              } catch (e) {
                // Handle any errors that occur during the request
                print('Error: $e');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Fetch Data'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Dynatrace plugin with the application ID.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is built, which contains a button to fetch data.
// 3. When the button is pressed, a Dio instance is created.
// 4. A GET request is made to the specified URL.
// 5. If the request is successful, the response data is printed to the console.
// 6. If an error occurs, it is caught and printed to the console.
```
