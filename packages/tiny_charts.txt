# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Tiny Charts

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **tiny_charts** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **tiny_charts** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tiny_charts: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the **tiny_charts** package:

```dart
import 'package:tiny_charts/tiny_charts.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Tiny Charts

You can now use the **tiny_charts** package to create charts. Below is a simple example of how to create a line chart.

```dart
// Create a list of data points for the chart
final List<ChartData> data = [
  ChartData(x: 1, y: 5),
  ChartData(x: 2, y: 10),
  ChartData(x: 3, y: 15),
  ChartData(x: 4, y: 20),
];

// Create a line chart widget
final lineChart = LineChart(
  data: data,
  title: 'Sample Line Chart',
  xAxisLabel: 'X Axis',
  yAxisLabel: 'Y Axis',
);
```

Now you can add the `lineChart` widget to your widget tree.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the **tiny_charts** package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Tiny Charts in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tiny_charts/tiny_charts.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tiny Charts Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Tiny Charts Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: LineChartWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class LineChartWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a list of data points for the chart
    final List<ChartData> data = [
      ChartData(x: 1, y: 5),
      ChartData(x: 2, y: 10),
      ChartData(x: 3, y: 15),
      ChartData(x: 4, y: 20),
    ];

    // Create a line chart widget
    return LineChart(
      data: data,
      title: 'Sample Line Chart',
      xAxisLabel: 'X Axis',
      yAxisLabel: 'Y Axis',
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the LineChartWidget.
// The LineChartWidget builds a line chart using the LineChart class from the tiny_charts package.
// It creates a list of ChartData points and passes them to the LineChart widget along with labels for the axes.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, the application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget. The `RealFlutter` widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with a title and a home `Scaffold`. The `Scaffold` contains an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget that holds the `LineChartWidget`. The `LineChartWidget` builds a line chart using the `LineChart` class from the **tiny_charts** package. It creates a list of `ChartData` points and passes them to the `LineChart` widget along with labels for the axes.

This structured approach provides a comprehensive overview of the **tiny_charts** package, guiding users through setup, usage, and a complete example to illustrate its capabilities.
