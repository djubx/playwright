# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Styled Divider

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `styled_divider` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  styled_divider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `styled_divider` package:

```dart
import 'package:styled_divider/styled_divider.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Styled Divider

You can now use the `StyledDivider` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to implement it in both Android and iOS:

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 5: Example Usage

You can use the `StyledDivider` widget in your widget tree as follows:

```dart
StyledDivider(
  color: Colors.blue,
  thickness: 2,
  space: 20,
  orientation: DividerOrientation.horizontal,
)
```

This creates a horizontal divider with a blue color, a thickness of 2 pixels, and a space of 20 pixels around it.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `styled_divider` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Styled Divider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:styled_divider/styled_divider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Styled Divider Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Styled Divider Demo'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              Text(
                'Section 1',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              // Adding a styled divider between sections
              StyledDivider(
                color: Colors.blue,
                thickness: 2,
                space: 20,
                orientation: DividerOrientation.horizontal,
              ),
              Text(
                'Section 2',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              // Another styled divider
              StyledDivider(
                color: Colors.red,
                thickness: 3,
                space: 15,
                orientation: DividerOrientation.horizontal,
              ),
              Text(
                'Section 3',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of a Column widget that holds multiple Text widgets and StyledDivider widgets.
// 5. Each section is separated by a StyledDivider, which enhances the visual separation between the sections.
// 6. The StyledDivider is customizable, allowing different colors, thicknesses, and spaces for each divider.
