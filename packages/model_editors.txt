# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "model_editors" Package

## Installation
To get started with the `model_editors` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  model_editors: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `model_editors` package, you need to define a data model and create a form based on that model. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

1. Define a data model:

```dart
class UserModel {
  String name;
  String email;

  UserModel({required this.name, required this.email});
}
```

2. Create a form using the `model_editors` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:model_editors/model_editors.dart';

class UserForm extends StatelessWidget {
  final UserModel userModel;

  UserForm({required this.userModel});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ModelEditor<UserModel>(
      model: userModel,
      onSave: (updatedModel) {
        // Handle the updated model
        print('Updated User: ${updatedModel.name}, ${updatedModel.email}');
      },
      fields: [
        TextFieldEditor(
          label: 'Name',
          initialValue: userModel.name,
          onChanged: (value) => userModel.name = value,
        ),
        TextFieldEditor(
          label: 'Email',
          initialValue: userModel.email,
          onChanged: (value) => userModel.email = value,
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a simple user form using the `model_editors` package. The `ModelEditor` widget takes care of rendering the form and handling user input.

# Complete Example of Using the "model_editors" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:model_editors/model_editors.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp widget that sets up the MaterialApp
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Model Editors Example',
      home: UserFormScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// UserFormScreen widget that displays the user form
class UserFormScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create an instance of UserModel with default values
  final UserModel userModel = UserModel(name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('User Form'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: UserForm(userModel: userModel), // Pass the user model to the UserForm
      ),
    );
  }
}

// UserModel class representing the data structure
class UserModel {
  String name;
  String email;

  UserModel({required this.name, required this.email});
}

// UserForm widget that builds the form using model_editors
class UserForm extends StatelessWidget {
  final UserModel userModel;

  UserForm({required this.userModel});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ModelEditor<UserModel>(
      model: userModel,
      onSave: (updatedModel) {
        // Handle the updated model
        print('Updated User: ${updatedModel.name}, ${updatedModel.email}');
      },
      fields: [
        TextFieldEditor(
          label: 'Name',
          initialValue: userModel.name,
          onChanged: (value) => userModel.name = value,
        ),
        TextFieldEditor(
          label: 'Email',
          initialValue: userModel.email,
          onChanged: (value) => userModel.email = value,
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
2. MyApp sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (UserFormScreen).
3. UserFormScreen creates an instance of UserModel with default values and displays the UserForm.
4. UserForm uses the ModelEditor widget to create a form based on the UserModel.
5. The form contains two fields: Name and Email, which are editable by the user.
6. When the user changes the values and saves, the updated model is printed to the console.
