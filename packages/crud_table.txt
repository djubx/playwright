# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `crud_table`

## Installation

To get started with the `crud_table` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  crud_table: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/crud_table).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the `crud_table` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:crud_table/crud_table.dart';
```

2. Create a simple CRUD table by using the `RealFlutter` class. You can define your data model and implement the CRUD operations.

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('CRUD Table Example'),
      ),
      body: CrudTable(
        // Define your data source and other properties here
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This basic setup will create a scaffold with an app bar and a CRUD table in the body. You can customize the `CrudTable` widget further to suit your needs.

# Complete Example of `crud_table`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:crud_table/crud_table.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'CRUD Table Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('CRUD Table Example'),
      ),
      body: CrudTable(
        // Define your data source
        data: [
          {'id': 1, 'name': 'Item 1'},
          {'id': 2, 'name': 'Item 2'},
        ],
        // Define columns
        columns: [
          CrudColumn(title: 'ID', field: 'id'),
          CrudColumn(title: 'Name', field: 'name'),
        ],
        // Define actions
        actions: [
          CrudAction(
            icon: Icons.add,
            onPressed: () {
              // Logic to add a new item
            },
          ),
          CrudAction(
            icon: Icons.edit,
            onPressed: () {
              // Logic to edit an item
            },
          ),
          CrudAction(
            icon: Icons.delete,
            onPressed: () {
              // Logic to delete an item
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget is displayed as the home screen, containing a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title 'CRUD Table Example'.
// 5. The CrudTable widget is used to display a list of items with defined columns and actions.
// 6. The data source is a list of maps, each representing an item with an ID and name.
// 7. The columns are defined to display the ID and name of each item.
// 8. Actions are provided for adding, editing, and deleting items, with placeholders for the logic.
// 9. The app is responsive and can be further customized to fit specific requirements.
