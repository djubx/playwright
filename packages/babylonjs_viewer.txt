<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# BabylonJS Viewer Flutter Package

The `babylonjs_viewer` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to integrate 3D models into their Flutter applications using the Babylon.js engine. This package is particularly useful for applications that require interactive 3D visualizations, such as gaming, architecture, education, and e-commerce.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `babylonjs_viewer` package when:
- You need to display complex 3D models in your Flutter app.
- You want to provide an interactive experience for users, allowing them to manipulate and explore 3D objects.
- Your application requires high-performance rendering of 3D graphics.

## Features

- **3D Model Rendering**: Load and display 3D models in various formats (e.g., .glTF, .obj).
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can rotate, zoom, and pan around the 3D models.
- **Customizable Environment**: Set up lighting, camera angles, and other environmental settings to enhance the visual experience.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

The `babylonjs_viewer` package leverages the capabilities of Babylon.js, a powerful 3D engine, to provide a rich and interactive 3D experience within Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the BabylonJS Viewer

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `babylonjs_viewer` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `babylonjs_viewer` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  babylonjs_viewer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` if you plan to load models from the internet:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following to allow arbitrary loads (if loading models from the internet):

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple Flutter application that uses the `babylonjs_viewer` package to display a 3D model.

### Example Code

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:babylonjs_viewer/babylonjs_viewer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'BabylonJS Viewer Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('3D Model Viewer'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: BabylonJSViewer(
            // Specify the URL of the 3D model
            modelUrl: 'https://example.com/model.glb',
            // Optional: Set the background color
            backgroundColor: Colors.white,
            // Optional: Set the camera position
            cameraPosition: Vector3(0, 1, -5),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

# Complete Example of BabylonJS Viewer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:babylonjs_viewer/babylonjs_viewer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'BabylonJS Viewer Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('3D Model Viewer'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: BabylonJSViewer(
            // Specify the URL of the 3D model
            modelUrl: 'https://example.com/model.glb',
            // Optional: Set the background color
            backgroundColor: Colors.white,
            // Optional: Set the camera position
            cameraPosition: Vector3(0, 1, -5),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function initializes the Flutter app with the RealFlutter widget.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title '3D Model Viewer'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold centers the BabylonJSViewer widget.
// 6. The BabylonJSViewer widget is configured with a model URL, background color, and camera position.
// 7. When the app runs, it displays the 3D model specified by the modelUrl, allowing users to interact with it.
