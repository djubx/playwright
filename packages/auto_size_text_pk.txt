# Auto Size Text PK Flutter Package

The `auto_size_text_pk` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for the automatic resizing of text to fit within a specified bounding box. This package is particularly useful when dealing with dynamic text content where the size of the text may vary based on user input or data fetched from an API. 

## When to Use This Package
- **Dynamic Text Content**: When displaying text that can change in length, such as user-generated content or data from a database.
- **Responsive Design**: In applications that need to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring that text remains legible and well-fitted.
- **UI Consistency**: To maintain a consistent look and feel across different devices by preventing text overflow or clipping.

## Features
- **Automatic Resizing**: Automatically adjusts the font size to fit the text within its bounds.
- **Multiple Lines Support**: Handles multi-line text and adjusts accordingly.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to set minimum and maximum font sizes, text alignment, and more.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to implement with minimal setup required.

Overall, the `auto_size_text_pk` package enhances the user experience by ensuring that text is always displayed clearly and attractively, regardless of the content or device.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Auto Size Text PK

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the `auto_size_text_pk` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  auto_size_text_pk: ^3.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file where you want to use the `AutoSizeText` widget, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:auto_size_text_pk/auto_size_text_pk.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using AutoSizeText
You can now use the `AutoSizeText` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AutoSizeText(
  'This is a sample text that will resize automatically.',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30),
  maxLines: 2,
  minFontSize: 10,
  maxFontSize: 30,
  textAlign: TextAlign.center,
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in your Xcode project settings.

### Optimizations
- Use `minFontSize` and `maxFontSize` to control the scaling of text effectively.
- Consider using `maxLines` to limit the number of lines displayed, which can help maintain a clean UI.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `auto_size_text_pk` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Using Auto Size Text PK

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:auto_size_text_pk/auto_size_text_pk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Auto Size Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Auto Size Text PK Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AutoSizeText(
            'This text will resize to fit within the bounds of the widget.',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30),
            maxLines: 2, // Limit to 2 lines
            minFontSize: 10, // Minimum font size
            maxFontSize: 30, // Maximum font size
            textAlign: TextAlign.center, // Center align the text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we use AutoSizeText to display a text string.
// 5. The AutoSizeText widget automatically resizes the text based on the available space.
// 6. The text is styled with a base font size of 30, and it can shrink to a minimum of 10.
// 7. The text is limited to a maximum of 2 lines and is center-aligned for better presentation.
```
