# flutter_float_widget: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_float_widget`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_float_widget: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_float_widget).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for overlaying views. You may need to add the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to adjust your app's Info.plist to allow for floating widgets. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `flutter_float_widget` in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_float_widget/flutter_float_widget.dart';
   ```

2. Create a floating widget using the `FloatWidget` class:
   ```dart
   FloatWidget(
     child: Icon(Icons.chat, size: 50),
     onDrag: (offset) {
       // Handle drag event
     },
   );
   ```

3. Add the floating widget to your widget tree, typically in the `Scaffold` body or as an overlay.

With these steps, you can easily integrate floating widgets into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_float_widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_float_widget/flutter_float_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Float Widget Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Floating Widget Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Tap the floating icon!'),
        ),
        // Adding the floating widget to the overlay
        floatingActionButton: FloatWidget(
          child: Icon(Icons.chat, size: 50, color: Colors.blue),
          onDrag: (offset) {
            // Handle the drag event to reposition the widget
            print('Dragging to: $offset');
          },
          onTap: () {
            // Handle tap event
            print('Floating icon tapped!');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget displaying a text message.
// 4. The floating action button is created using the FloatWidget class.
// 5. The FloatWidget takes a child (an Icon) and has two callbacks: onDrag and onTap.
// 6. The onDrag callback prints the new position of the widget when it is dragged.
// 7. The onTap callback prints a message when the floating icon is tapped.
// 8. This setup allows for interactive floating widgets that enhance user experience.
