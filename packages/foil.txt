# Foil Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **Foil** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to simplify the process of managing and manipulating data in their applications. It provides a set of utilities that help in creating, validating, and managing forms and data models efficiently. 

## When to Use Foil
You might consider using the Foil package in scenarios such as:
- Building complex forms with multiple fields and validation rules.
- Managing state for data models in a clean and efficient manner.
- Simplifying the process of data serialization and deserialization.

## Key Features
- **Form Management**: Easily create and manage forms with built-in validation.
- **Data Models**: Define data models with ease, including serialization and deserialization.
- **Validation**: Implement custom validation rules for form fields.
- **Reactive Programming**: Integrate seamlessly with reactive programming paradigms.

With these features, Foil aims to enhance productivity and reduce boilerplate code in Flutter applications.

# Foil Package Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Foil package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  foil: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/foil).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a form using Foil:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:foil/foil.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Foil Example')),
        body: MyForm(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyForm extends StatelessWidget {
  final FormController _formController = FormController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Form(
      controller: _formController,
      child: Column(
        children: [
          TextField(
            onChanged: (value) => _formController.updateField('name', value),
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Name'),
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              if (_formController.validate()) {
                // Handle form submission
              }
            },
            child: Text('Submit'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple form with a text field and a submit button. The `FormController` from the Foil package manages the state and validation of the form.

# Complete Example of Foil Package in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:foil/foil.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Foil Example')),
        body: MyForm(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyForm extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create an instance of FormController to manage form state
  final FormController _formController = FormController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Form(
      // Attach the FormController to the Form widget
      controller: _formController,
      child: Column(
        children: [
          // TextField for user input
          TextField(
            // Update the form controller with the input value
            onChanged: (value) => _formController.updateField('name', value),
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Name'),
          ),
          // Submit button
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Validate the form before submission
              if (_formController.validate()) {
                // Handle form submission (e.g., send data to server)
                print('Form submitted successfully!');
              } else {
                // Handle validation errors
                print('Validation failed!');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Submit'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// Inside the MaterialApp, we have a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing the MyForm widget.
// The MyForm widget uses a FormController to manage the state of the form.
// When the user types in the TextField, the form controller updates its state.
// Upon pressing the Submit button, the form is validated, and if successful, a message is printed to the console.
```
