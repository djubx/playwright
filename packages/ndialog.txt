# NDialog Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the **ndialog** package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ndialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the **ndialog** package, you can create a simple dialog as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ndialog/ndialog.dart';

void showCustomDialog(BuildContext context) {
  NDialog(
    title: Text("Custom Dialog"),
    content: Text("This is a custom dialog using NDialog."),
    actions: [
      TextButton(
        onPressed: () {
          Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
        },
        child: Text("Close"),
      ),
    ],
  ).show(context);
}
```

In this example, we create a simple dialog with a title, content, and a close button. You can call `showCustomDialog(context)` from anywhere in your widget tree to display the dialog.

# NDialog Flutter Package: Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ndialog/ndialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'NDialog Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('NDialog Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Call the function to show the custom dialog
              showCustomDialog(context);
            },
            child: Text('Show Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showCustomDialog(BuildContext context) {
    // Create and show a custom dialog
    NDialog(
      title: Text("Custom Dialog"),
      content: Column(
        mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
        children: [
          Text("This is a custom dialog using NDialog."),
          TextField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: "Enter something"),
          ),
        ],
      ),
      actions: [
        TextButton(
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
          },
          child: Text("Close"),
        ),
      ],
    ).show(context);
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'NDialog Example'.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the showCustomDialog function is called.
// 6. The showCustomDialog function creates a new NDialog instance with a title, content (including a TextField), and actions (a close button).
// 7. The dialog is displayed when the show() method is called with the current context.
// 8. Pressing the close button dismisses the dialog, returning to the main screen.
