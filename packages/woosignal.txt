Setting Up Woosignal
---------------------

To get started with Woosignal, you'll need to add the package to your Flutter project. You can do this by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  woosignal: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

Configuring Woosignal
---------------------

To use Woosignal, you'll need to configure it with your WooCommerce store's API credentials. You can do this by creating a new instance of the `Woosignal` class and passing in your store's URL, consumer key, and consumer secret:

```dart
import 'package:woosignal/woosignal.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  Woosignal _woosignal;

  RealFlutter() {
    _woosignal = Woosignal(
      url: 'https://example.com/wp-json/wc/v3',
      consumerKey: 'your_consumer_key',
      consumerSecret: 'your_consumer_secret',
    );
  }
}
```

Using Woosignal
----------------

Once you've configured Woosignal, you can use it to interact with your WooCommerce store's API. For example, you can use the `getProducts` method to retrieve a list of products:

```dart
class RealFlutter {
  // ...

  Future<List<Product>> getProducts() async {
    final response = await _woosignal.getProducts();
    return response.data;
  }
}
```

Platform-Specific Details
-------------------------

Woosignal works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details to keep in mind:

* On Android, you'll need to add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file to enable internet access:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

* On iOS, you'll need to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file to enable internet access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

  Future<void> _loadProducts() async {
    final response = await _woosignal.getProducts();
    setState(() {

      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Woosignal Example'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: _products.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {

            title: Text(_products[index].name),
            subtitle: Text(_products[index].price),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by creating a new instance of the Woosignal class and configuring it with the WooCommerce store's API credentials.
// The _loadProducts method is called in the initState method to load the products from the WooCommerce store.
// The _loadProducts method uses the getProducts method of the Woosignal class to retrieve a list of products from the WooCommerce store.
// The products are then stored in the _products list and the setState method is called to update the UI.
// The ListView.builder widget is used to display the products in a list.
// The ListTile widget is used to display each product's name and price.

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Woosignal Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
