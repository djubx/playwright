# Animation Wrappers Flutter Package

The `animation_wrappers` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of adding animations to your Flutter applications. It provides a set of pre-built animation wrappers that can be easily integrated into your widgets, allowing developers to create smooth and visually appealing transitions without the need for extensive custom animation code.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `animation_wrappers` package when:
- You want to enhance user experience with animations but lack the time or expertise to implement complex animations from scratch.
- You are developing applications that require consistent animations across multiple screens or components.
- You need to quickly prototype animations for user interfaces.

## Features

- **Pre-built Animation Wrappers**: The package includes various animation wrappers that can be applied to any widget, making it easy to add animations with minimal code.
- **Customizable Animations**: While the package provides default animations, you can customize parameters such as duration, curve, and more to fit your design needs.
- **Ease of Use**: The API is designed to be intuitive, allowing developers to wrap their widgets with animation effects in just a few lines of code.

Overall, the `animation_wrappers` package is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to implement animations quickly and efficiently.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Animation Wrappers Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `animation_wrappers` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animation_wrappers: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to wrap a widget with an animation:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animation_wrappers/animation_wrappers.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animation Wrappers Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: FadedScaleAnimation(
          child: Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
          duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `FadedScaleAnimation` wrapper is used to animate a blue square. The animation will fade in and scale up over one second.

# Complete Example of Using Animation Wrappers

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animation_wrappers/animation_wrappers.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animation Wrappers Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animation Wrappers Example')),
      body: Center(
        // Wrapping the Container with FadedScaleAnimation for animation effect
        child: FadedScaleAnimation(
          child: Container(
            width: 100, // Width of the animated container
            height: 100, // Height of the animated container
            color: Colors.blue, // Color of the container
          ),
          duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Duration of the animation
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a FadedScaleAnimation wraps a Container.
// 5. The Container is set to 100x100 pixels and colored blue.
// 6. The FadedScaleAnimation applies a fade and scale effect to the Container over 1 second.
// 7. When the app runs, the blue square will fade in and scale up smoothly.
