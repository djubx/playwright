# Eraser Flutter Package

The **Eraser** package for Flutter is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the creation of drawing applications where users can draw and erase on a canvas. This package is particularly useful for applications that require user interaction through drawing, such as educational apps, art applications, or any app that involves sketching or annotations.

## When to Use the Eraser Package

You might consider using the Eraser package in scenarios such as:
- **Educational Apps**: Where students can draw diagrams or annotate images.
- **Art Applications**: Allowing users to create and modify their artwork.
- **Annotation Tools**: For marking up documents or images.

## Features

- **Drawing Capabilities**: Users can draw freely on the canvas.
- **Eraser Functionality**: Users can erase parts of their drawings with adjustable eraser sizes.
- **Customizable Colors and Brush Sizes**: Users can select different colors and brush sizes for drawing.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Eraser Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Eraser package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  eraser: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the current version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires access to the device's storage or camera. However, for basic drawing functionality, no special permissions are required.

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the Eraser package:

```dart
import 'package:eraser/eraser.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Eraser Package

You can now use the Eraser package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to set up a drawing canvas with eraser functionality.

# Complete Example: Drawing and Erasing with the Eraser Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:eraser/eraser.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Eraser Example',
      home: DrawingPage(),
    );
  }
}

class DrawingPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DrawingPageState createState() => _DrawingPageState();
}

class _DrawingPageState extends State<DrawingPage> {
  // Create a controller for the Eraser
  final EraserController _eraserController = EraserController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Eraser Example'),
        actions: [
          // Button to clear the canvas
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.clear),
            onPressed: () {
              _eraserController.clear();
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Eraser(
          controller: _eraserController,
          // Set the size of the eraser
          eraserSize: 20.0,
          // Set the background color of the canvas
          backgroundColor: Colors.white,
          // Set the drawing color
          drawingColor: Colors.black,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. The DrawingPage is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the drawing canvas.
// 4. An EraserController is created to manage the eraser's functionality.
// 5. The Scaffold widget provides the app structure, including an AppBar with a clear button.
// 6. The Eraser widget is used to create a drawing area where users can draw and erase.
// 7. The eraser size and colors are customizable, allowing for a personalized drawing experience.
// 8. The clear button in the AppBar allows users to reset the canvas, clearing all drawings.
