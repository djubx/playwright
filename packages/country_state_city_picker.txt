# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `country_state_city_picker` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `country_state_city_picker` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  country_state_city_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the country, state, and city picker in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_state_city_picker/country_state_city_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: LocationPicker(),
    );
  }
}

class LocationPicker extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LocationPickerState createState() => _LocationPickerState();
}

class _LocationPickerState extends State<LocationPicker> {
  String? selectedCountry;
  String? selectedState;
  String? selectedCity;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Location Picker')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            CountryStateCityPicker(
              onChanged: (country, state, city) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedCountry = country;
                  selectedState = state;
                  selectedCity = city;
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Selected Country: $selectedCountry'),
            Text('Selected State: $selectedState'),
            Text('Selected City: $selectedCity'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that allows users to select their country, state, and city. The selected values are displayed on the screen.

# Complete Example of the `country_state_city_picker` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_state_city_picker/country_state_city_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: LocationPicker(),
    );
  }
}

class LocationPicker extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LocationPickerState createState() => _LocationPickerState();
}

class _LocationPickerState extends State<LocationPicker> {
  String? selectedCountry; // Variable to hold the selected country
  String? selectedState;   // Variable to hold the selected state
  String? selectedCity;    // Variable to hold the selected city

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Location Picker')), // App bar title
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0), // Padding around the content
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Country, state, and city picker widget
            CountryStateCityPicker(
              onChanged: (country, state, city) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedCountry = country; // Update selected country
                  selectedState = state;     // Update selected state
                  selectedCity = city;       // Update selected city
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between picker and text
            // Display selected country
            Text('Selected Country: $selectedCountry'),
            // Display selected state
            Text('Selected State: $selectedState'),
            // Display selected city
            Text('Selected City: $selectedCity'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a home set to LocationPicker.
// 3. The LocationPicker widget is a stateful widget that maintains the selected country, state, and city.
// 4. The CountryStateCityPicker widget is used to allow users to select their location.
// 5. When a user selects a country, state, or city, the onChanged callback updates the state variables.
// 6. The selected values are displayed below the picker in real-time.
