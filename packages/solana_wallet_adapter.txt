## Basic Usage
To use the `solana_wallet_adapter`, you need to initialize the wallet adapter and set up the connection. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:solana_wallet_adapter/solana_wallet_adapter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Solana Wallet Adapter Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize the wallet adapter
              final walletAdapter = SolanaWalletAdapter();
              // Connect to the wallet
              await walletAdapter.connect();
              // Fetch the wallet address
              final address = await walletAdapter.getAccount();
              print('Connected wallet address: $address');
            },
            child: Text('Connect Wallet'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that connects to a Solana wallet and prints the wallet address.

# Complete Example of solana_wallet_adapter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:solana_wallet_adapter/solana_wallet_adapter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Solana Wallet Adapter Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize the wallet adapter
              final walletAdapter = SolanaWalletAdapter();
              
              // Connect to the wallet
              await walletAdapter.connect();
              
              // Fetch the wallet address
              final address = await walletAdapter.getAccount();
              print('Connected wallet address: $address');
              
              // You can now use the address to perform transactions or display it
            },
            child: Text('Connect Wallet'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, initializes the Solana wallet adapter.
// 4. The wallet adapter attempts to connect to the user's wallet.
// 5. Upon successful connection, the wallet address is fetched and printed to the console.
// 6. Developers can extend this functionality to perform transactions or display wallet information in the UI.
