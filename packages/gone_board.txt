# Gone Board Flutter Package

The **gone_board** package is a Flutter library designed to simplify the management of widget visibility in your applications. It provides a straightforward way to hide or show widgets based on specific conditions, making it particularly useful for dynamic UIs where elements need to be conditionally displayed or hidden.

## When to Use Gone Board
You might consider using the gone_board package in scenarios such as:
- **Dynamic Forms**: When certain fields should only be visible based on user input.
- **Conditional Navigation**: When you want to show or hide navigation elements based on user roles or permissions.
- **Responsive Design**: To adapt the UI based on screen size or orientation.

## Key Features
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate and use within your Flutter applications.
- **Conditional Visibility**: Control the visibility of widgets based on boolean conditions.
- **Animation Support**: Optionally animate the appearance and disappearance of widgets for a smoother user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Gone Board

## Installation
To add the gone_board package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gone_board: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/gone_board).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Basic Usage
To use the gone_board package, you can wrap your widgets with the `Gone` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gone_board/gone_board.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    bool isVisible = true; // Control visibility

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Gone Board Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Gone(
                visible: isVisible, // Control visibility here
                child: Text('I am visible!'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Toggle visibility
                  isVisible = !isVisible;
                },
                child: Text('Toggle Visibility'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `Gone` widget will show or hide the text based on the `isVisible` boolean.

# Complete Example of Gone Board

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gone_board/gone_board.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool isVisible = true; // State variable to control visibility

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Gone Board Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Using the Gone widget to conditionally display the text
              Gone(
                visible: isVisible, // Check the visibility state
                child: Text('I am visible!'), // This text will be hidden or shown
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Toggle the visibility state
                  setState(() {
                    isVisible = !isVisible; // Change the state
                  });
                },
                child: Text('Toggle Visibility'), // Button to toggle visibility
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}
```

// The application starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// The state variable `isVisible` is initialized to true, meaning the text will be visible initially.
// The `Gone` widget checks the `isVisible` state to determine whether to display the text.
// When the button is pressed, the `onPressed` callback toggles the `isVisible` state.
// The `setState` method is called to rebuild the widget with the new visibility state.
// This allows the text to appear or disappear based on the button press, demonstrating the functionality of the gone_board package.

In summary, the gone_board package provides a simple yet effective way to manage widget visibility in Flutter applications. By using the `Gone` widget, developers can easily control which elements are displayed based on specific conditions, enhancing the interactivity and responsiveness of their UIs.
