# Overview of the Snake Flutter Package

The **Snake** package is a powerful and flexible tool designed for creating snake-like animations in Flutter applications. It allows developers to easily implement smooth, customizable animations that can enhance the user experience in games, educational apps, or any application that benefits from dynamic visual feedback.

## When to Use the Snake Package
- **Game Development**: Ideal for creating snake games or similar mechanics where movement and animation are crucial.
- **Interactive UI Elements**: Use it to animate UI components in a way that mimics snake-like movement, adding a playful touch to your app.
- **Educational Apps**: Great for visualizing concepts that require movement or flow, such as teaching programming logic or algorithms.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Animation**: Control the speed, direction, and behavior of the snake animation.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick setup and implementation in any Flutter project.
- **Performance Optimized**: Designed to run smoothly on both Android and iOS devices without significant performance overhead.

# Setting Up the Snake Package

To get started with the Snake package, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the Snake package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     snake: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
- For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Basic Usage

To use the Snake package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:snake/snake.dart';
```

You can then create a simple snake animation by using the `Snake` widget provided by the package.

# Complete Example of Using the Snake Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:snake/snake.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Snake Animation Example',
      home: SnakeAnimationScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class SnakeAnimationScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SnakeAnimationScreenState createState() => _SnakeAnimationScreenState();
}

class _SnakeAnimationScreenState extends State<SnakeAnimationScreen> {
  // Create a SnakeController to manage the snake's animation
  late SnakeController _snakeController;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the SnakeController with desired parameters
    _snakeController = SnakeController(
      speed: 100, // Speed of the snake
      direction: SnakeDirection.right, // Initial direction
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _snakeController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Snake Animation'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Use the Snake widget to display the animation
        child: Snake(
          controller: _snakeController,
          length: 5, // Length of the snake
          color: Colors.green, // Color of the snake
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Change the direction of the snake when the button is pressed
          _snakeController.changeDirection(SnakeDirection.down);
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.arrow_downward),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. SnakeAnimationScreen is a stateful widget that manages the snake animation.
// 4. In initState, a SnakeController is created to control the snake's speed and direction.
// 5. The Snake widget is displayed in the center of the screen, using the controller to manage its state.
// 6. A FloatingActionButton is provided to change the snake's direction when pressed.
// 7. The controller is disposed of in the dispose method to free up resources when the widget is removed.
