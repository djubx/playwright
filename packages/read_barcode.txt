# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `read_barcode` Package

## Installation
To get started with the `read_barcode` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  read_barcode: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/read_barcode).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

3. Add the necessary permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera to scan barcodes.</string>
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement barcode scanning.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:read_barcode/read_barcode.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String barcodeResult = "Scan a barcode";

  // Function to initiate barcode scanning
  Future<void> scanBarcode() async {
    try {
      // Start the barcode scanning process
      String result = await ReadBarcode.scan();
      // Update the state with the scanned result
      setState(() {
        barcodeResult = result;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during scanning
      setState(() {
        barcodeResult = "Failed to scan: $e";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Barcode Scanner"),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(barcodeResult), // Display the scanned result
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: scanBarcode, // Trigger the scan on button press
              child: Text("Scan Barcode"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that allows users to scan barcodes. The `scanBarcode` function initiates the scanning process and updates the UI with the result.

# Complete Example of Using `read_barcode`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:read_barcode/read_barcode.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String barcodeResult = "Scan a barcode"; // Initial message before scanning

  // Function to initiate barcode scanning
  Future<void> scanBarcode() async {
    try {
      // Start the barcode scanning process
      String result = await ReadBarcode.scan();
      // Update the state with the scanned result
      setState(() {
        barcodeResult = result; // Update the displayed result
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during scanning
      setState(() {
        barcodeResult = "Failed to scan: $e"; // Update with error message
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Barcode Scanner"), // App title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(barcodeResult), // Display the scanned result
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between text and button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: scanBarcode, // Trigger the scan on button press
              child: Text("Scan Barcode"), // Button label
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with a simple UI displaying a message prompting the user to scan a barcode.
// 2. When the user presses the "Scan Barcode" button, the `scanBarcode` function is called.
// 3. The `scanBarcode` function uses the `ReadBarcode.scan()` method to initiate the scanning process.
// 4. If a barcode is successfully scanned, the result is displayed on the screen.
// 5. If an error occurs during scanning, an error message is shown instead.
// 6. The UI updates dynamically based on the scanning result or any errors encountered.
