# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Text Divider Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **text_divider** package, you first need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  text_divider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the **text_divider** in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_divider/text_divider.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Text Divider Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              Text('Section 1: Introduction'),
              TextDivider(), // Using the text divider here
              Text('This is the first section of the content.'),
              TextDivider(), // Another divider
              Text('Section 2: Details'),
              Text('This section contains more detailed information.'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the **text_divider** package to separate different sections of text. The `TextDivider` widget is used to create visual breaks between the text sections.

# Complete Example of Using the Text Divider Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_divider/text_divider.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Text Divider Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // First section of text
              Text('Section 1: Introduction'),
              // Divider between sections
              TextDivider(), // This creates a visual break
              // Content of the first section
              Text('This is the first section of the content.'),
              // Another divider for the next section
              TextDivider(), // Another visual break
              // Second section of text
              Text('Section 2: Details'),
              // Content of the second section
              Text('This section contains more detailed information.'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body consists of a Column widget that holds multiple Text widgets and TextDivider widgets.
// 4. Each TextDivider creates a visual separation between the text sections, enhancing readability.
// 5. The layout is padded for better aesthetics, and the app displays two sections of text with dividers in between.
