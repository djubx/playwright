# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_media_downloader

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_media_downloader` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_media_downloader` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_media_downloader: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. If targeting Android 10 (API level 29) or higher, add the following attribute to your `AndroidManifest.xml` to allow access to external storage:

```xml
<application
    android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"
    ... >
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save downloaded media.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio downloads.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to download a media file.

# Complete Example: Flutter Media Downloader

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_media_downloader/flutter_media_downloader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the download progress
  double _progress = 0.0;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the downloader
    FlutterMediaDownloader.initialize();
  }

  // Function to start downloading a media file
  void _downloadMedia() async {
    // URL of the media file to download
    String url = 'https://example.com/media.mp4';
    // Start the download
    final taskId = await FlutterMediaDownloader.download(url, 'media.mp4');

    // Listen for download progress
    FlutterMediaDownloader.onProgress(taskId).listen((progress) {
      setState(() {
        _progress = progress; // Update the progress variable
      });
    });

    // Listen for download completion
    FlutterMediaDownloader.onDownloadComplete(taskId).listen((_) {
      // Notify user of completion
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Download completed!')),
      );
    });

    // Listen for download errors
    FlutterMediaDownloader.onDownloadError(taskId).listen((error) {
      // Notify user of error
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Download failed: $error')),
      );
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Media Downloader')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('Download Progress: ${(_progress * 100).toStringAsFixed(0)}%'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _downloadMedia,
                child: Text('Download Media'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. In the `RealFlutter` state, we initialize the media downloader in `initState()`.
// 3. The `_downloadMedia` function is called when the user presses the "Download Media" button.
// 4. We specify the URL of the media file to download and start the download process.
// 5. We listen for download progress updates and update the `_progress` variable accordingly.
// 6. When the download completes, we show a SnackBar notification to the user.
// 7. If an error occurs during the download, we also notify the user via a SnackBar.
// 8. The UI displays the current download progress and a button to initiate the download.
```
