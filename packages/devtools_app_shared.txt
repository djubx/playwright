```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:devtools_app_shared/devtools_app_shared.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a new DevTools app
    final devToolsApp = DevToolsApp();

    // Return the DevTools app as the root of the widget tree
    return devToolsApp;
  }
}

// The DevTools app is a stateful widget that provides the main app UI
class DevToolsApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DevToolsAppState createState() => _DevToolsAppState();
}

class _DevToolsAppState extends State<DevToolsApp> {
  // Initialize the DevTools app with a default title
  String _title = 'DevTools App';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a new app bar with the title
    final appBar = AppBar(
      title: Text(_title),
    );

    // Create a new body with a single child
    final body = Center(
      child: Text('Hello, World!'),
    );

    // Return the app bar and body as the main app UI
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: appBar,
      body: body,
    );
  }
}

// The flow of the application is as follows:
// 1. The RealFlutter app is created and run.
// 2. The RealFlutter app builds the DevTools app as the root of the widget tree.
// 3. The DevTools app is a stateful widget that provides the main app UI.
// 4. The DevTools app initializes with a default title and builds the app bar and body.
// 5. The app bar and body are returned as the main app UI.
// 6. The user interacts with the app, and the app responds accordingly.

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// RealFlutter -> DevToolsApp -> _DevToolsAppState -> build -> return app UI
