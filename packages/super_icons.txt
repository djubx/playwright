# Super Icons: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the super_icons package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  super_icons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Usage
To use the super_icons package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:super_icons/super_icons.dart';
```

You can then use the icons in your widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use an icon in a `Container`:

```dart
Container(
  child: Icon(
    SuperIcons.home, // Using an icon from the super_icons package
    size: 50.0,
    color: Colors.blue,
  ),
);
```

This will display a home icon with a size of 50 pixels and a blue color.

        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a home icon
              Icon(
                SuperIcons.home, // Using the home icon from super_icons
                size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a settings icon
              Icon(
                SuperIcons.settings, // Using the settings icon from super_icons
                size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a user icon
              Icon(
                SuperIcons.user, // Using the user icon from super_icons
                size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Super Icons Demo'.
// In the body, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// A Column widget is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// Each Icon widget uses an icon from the super_icons package, with specified size and color.
// SizedBox widgets are used to add spacing between the icons for better visual separation.
// The app demonstrates the use of three different icons: home, settings, and user.
