**Final Summary**

The code flows by first creating a new instance of MyApp, which builds a MaterialApp. The MaterialApp then builds its home page, which is an instance of RealFlutter. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Centered body. The body contains a SuperIcon widget, which displays an icon. The icon is customized with a size and color. The app uses the 'super_icons' package to display the icon, and the package is imported and used in the RealFlutter class. The app also uses the necessary permissions and frameworks to run on both Android and iOS platforms.
