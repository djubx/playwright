# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using sa3_liquid

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **sa3_liquid** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sa3_liquid: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a liquid animation using the **sa3_liquid** package.

# Complete Example of sa3_liquid

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sa3_liquid/sa3_liquid.dart'; // Import the sa3_liquid package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'sa3_liquid Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: LiquidHomePage(), // Set the home page to LiquidHomePage
    );
  }
}

class LiquidHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LiquidHomePageState createState() => _LiquidHomePageState();
}

class _LiquidHomePageState extends State<LiquidHomePage> {
  double _liquidHeight = 200.0; // Initial height of the liquid animation

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Liquid Animation Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Liquid animation widget
            Liquid(
              height: _liquidHeight, // Set the height of the liquid
              color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the liquid
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Liquid Animation', // Text displayed in the liquid
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between widgets
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _animateLiquid, // Trigger animation on button press
              child: Text('Animate Liquid'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to animate the liquid height
  void _animateLiquid() {
    setState(() {
      _liquidHeight = _liquidHeight == 200.0 ? 300.0 : 200.0; // Toggle height
    });
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter class.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// The home property of the MaterialApp is set to LiquidHomePage, which is a StatefulWidget.
// In LiquidHomePage, we define a state variable _liquidHeight to control the height of the liquid animation.
// The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// Inside the Center widget, we have a Column that contains the Liquid widget and an ElevatedButton.
// The Liquid widget displays a liquid animation with a height defined by _liquidHeight.
// The button, when pressed, calls the _animateLiquid method, which toggles the height of the liquid animation between 200.0 and 300.0.
// This creates a simple yet effective liquid animation effect in the app.
