# Overview of the `parsed_readmore` Flutter Package

The `parsed_readmore` Flutter package is a versatile tool designed to handle text overflow in a user-friendly manner. It allows developers to display a snippet of text with a "Read More" option, which expands to show the full content when clicked. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to display lengthy text content, such as articles, blog posts, or user reviews, without overwhelming the user interface.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Truncation**: Easily configure how much text is initially displayed and customize the "Read More" and "Read Less" labels.
- **Rich Text Support**: The package supports rich text, allowing you to style the text with different fonts, colors, and sizes.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Provides smooth animations when expanding or collapsing the text, enhancing the user experience.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

### When to Use

- **Content-Heavy Applications**: Ideal for apps that need to display large amounts of text content in a compact form.
- **News and Blog Apps**: Perfect for showing article previews with an option to expand for full content.
- **Social Media Apps**: Useful for displaying user-generated content like comments or posts that may vary in length.

# Setting Up and Using the `parsed_readmore` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `parsed_readmore` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `parsed_readmore` package under dependencies.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     parsed_readmore: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package.

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Basic Usage

To use the `parsed_readmore` package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:parsed_readmore/parsed_readmore.dart';
```

### Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

No specific configuration is required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Using the `RealFlutter` Class

Here's a simple example of how to use the `RealFlutter` class to display expandable text:

```dart
RealFlutter(
  text: 'This is a long text that needs to be truncated. Click read more to see the full content.',
  trimLines: 2,
  colorClickableText: Colors.blue,
  trimMode: TrimMode.Line,
  trimCollapsedText: 'Read more',
  trimExpandedText: 'Read less',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 14, color: Colors.black),
)
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:parsed_readmore/parsed_readmore.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Parsed ReadMore Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Parsed ReadMore Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: RealFlutter(
          text: 'Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. With Flutter, you can quickly ship features with a focus on native end-user experiences. Layered architecture allows for full customization, which results in incredibly fast rendering and expressive and flexible designs.',
          trimLines: 3, // Number of lines to display before truncation
          colorClickableText: Colors.blue, // Color of the "Read more" text
          trimMode: TrimMode.Line, // Truncation mode
          trimCollapsedText: 'Read more', // Text to display when collapsed
          trimExpandedText: 'Read less', // Text to display when expanded
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.black), // Text style
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The `main` function is the entry point of the Flutter application, which calls `runApp` with `MyApp`.
// 2. `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies `MyHomePage` as the home screen.
// 3. `MyHomePage` is a stateless widget that builds the main UI, including an AppBar and a body containing the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 4. The `RealFlutter` widget is configured to display a snippet of text with a "Read more" option, which expands to show the full text when clicked.
// 5. The `trimLines` property determines how many lines are shown before truncation, and `trimMode` specifies the truncation method.
// 6. The `colorClickableText`, `trimCollapsedText`, and `trimExpandedText` properties customize the appearance and behavior of the expandable text.
// 7. The `style` property is used to define the text style, including font size and color.
