# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Huawei Scan Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `huawei_scan` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  huawei_scan: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>

    <application
        android:label="yourapp"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.huawei.hms.client.appid"
            android:value="your_app_id"/> <!-- Replace with your actual App ID -->
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure that your `android/build.gradle` file includes the necessary repositories:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven { url 'https://developer.huawei.com/repo/maven/' }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.0'
        classpath 'com.huawei.agconnect:agcp:1.6.0.300' // Add this line
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following permissions to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for scanning.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the photo library for scanning.</string>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed and run `pod install` in the `ios` directory.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have configured the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement scanning functionality.

# Complete Example of Using the Huawei Scan Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:huawei_scan/huawei_scan.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Huawei Scan Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ScannerPage(),
    );
  }
}

class ScannerPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ScannerPageState createState() => _ScannerPageState();
}

class _ScannerPageState extends State<ScannerPage> {
  String scannedData = "Scan a QR code or barcode";

  // Function to start scanning
  Future<void> startScan() async {
    try {
      // Start the scanning process
      final result = await Scan.scan();
      // Update the scanned data
      setState(() {
        scannedData = result?.data ?? "No data found";
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors during scanning
      setState(() {
        scannedData = "Error: $e";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Huawei Scan Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              scannedData,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: startScan,
              child: Text('Start Scanning'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets ScannerPage as the home.
// 3. ScannerPage is a stateful widget that maintains the scanned data.
// 4. The startScan function is called when the user presses the "Start Scanning" button.
// 5. The scanning process is initiated, and the result is stored in the scannedData variable.
// 6. The UI updates to display the scanned data or any error messages.
// 7. The user can scan multiple times by pressing the button again.
```
