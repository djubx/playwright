# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_simple_multiselect

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_simple_multiselect` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_simple_multiselect` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_simple_multiselect: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the multi-select widget, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_simple_multiselect/flutter_simple_multiselect.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Widget

You can now use the `SimpleMultiSelect` widget in your application. Below is a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
SimpleMultiSelect(
  items: [
    MultiSelectItem(value: 'Option 1', label: 'Option 1'),
    MultiSelectItem(value: 'Option 2', label: 'Option 2'),
    MultiSelectItem(value: 'Option 3', label: 'Option 3'),
  ],
  onSelectionChanged: (selectedItems) {
    // Handle the selection change
    print(selectedItems);
  },
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires access to specific features. However, for basic usage of `flutter_simple_multiselect`, no additional configurations are typically required.

## Step 4: Customization

The `flutter_simple_multiselect` package allows for customization of the widget's appearance. You can modify properties such as colors, text styles, and more to fit your app's design.

# Complete Example of flutter_simple_multiselect

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `flutter_simple_multiselect` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_simple_multiselect/flutter_simple_multiselect.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter MultiSelect Example',
      home: MultiSelectScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class MultiSelectScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MultiSelectScreenState createState() => _MultiSelectScreenState();
}

class _MultiSelectScreenState extends State<MultiSelectScreen> {
  // This list will hold the selected items
  List<String> selectedItems = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('MultiSelect Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // SimpleMultiSelect widget
            SimpleMultiSelect(
              items: [
                MultiSelectItem(value: 'Option 1', label: 'Option 1'),
                MultiSelectItem(value: 'Option 2', label: 'Option 2'),
                MultiSelectItem(value: 'Option 3', label: 'Option 3'),
                MultiSelectItem(value: 'Option 4', label: 'Option 4'),
              ],
              onSelectionChanged: (selected) {
                // Update the selected items
                setState(() {
                  selectedItems = selected;
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display selected items
            Text(
              'Selected Items: ${selectedItems.join(', ')}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (MultiSelectScreen).
// 3. MultiSelectScreen is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of selected items.
// 4. The SimpleMultiSelect widget is displayed, allowing users to select multiple options.
// 5. When the selection changes, the onSelectionChanged callback updates the selectedItems list.
// 6. The selected items are displayed below the multi-select widget, updating in real-time as the user makes selections.
```
