# libusb Flutter Package

The `libusb` Flutter package provides a powerful interface for USB device communication in Flutter applications. It allows developers to interact with USB devices directly, making it an excellent choice for applications that require low-level USB access, such as custom hardware interfaces, data acquisition systems, or any application that needs to communicate with USB peripherals.

## When to Use `libusb`
- **Custom Hardware Interfaces**: If your application needs to communicate with custom USB devices, `libusb` is a suitable choice.
- **Data Acquisition**: For applications that collect data from USB sensors or devices.
- **Device Control**: When you need to send commands to USB devices or receive data from them.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, allowing for a unified codebase.
- **Low-Level USB Access**: Provides direct access to USB devices, enabling detailed control over communication.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Supports asynchronous operations for non-blocking USB communication.
- **Device Discovery**: Easily discover connected USB devices and their capabilities.

# Setting Up the `libusb` Package

To get started with the `libusb` package in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `libusb` package:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     libusb: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/libusb).

2. **Run Flutter Packages Get**: After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USB_PERMISSION"/>
   ```

2. **USB Host Feature**: Ensure your app declares the USB host feature:

   ```xml
   <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.usb.host" />
   ```

### iOS
1. **Info.plist Configuration**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for USB access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSUSBUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires access to USB devices.</string>
   ```

## Using the Package

Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initialize the `libusb` library and list connected USB devices.

# Complete Example of Using `libusb`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:libusb/libusb.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<UsbDevice> _devices = []; // List to hold connected USB devices

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeUsb(); // Initialize USB communication on app start
  }

  // Function to initialize USB and list devices
  Future<void> _initializeUsb() async {
    // Initialize the libusb library
    final libusb = LibUsb();
    await libusb.init();

    // Get the list of connected USB devices
    _devices = await libusb.getDeviceList();

    // Update the UI with the list of devices
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('USB Devices')),
        body: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: _devices.length,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            // Display each connected USB device
            return ListTile(
              title: Text('Device: ${_devices[index].name}'),
              subtitle: Text('Vendor ID: ${_devices[index].vendorId}'),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code initializes a Flutter application that lists connected USB devices.
// 1. The `main` function runs the app by calling `runApp` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. In the `RealFlutter` widget, we define a stateful widget to manage the USB device list.
// 3. The `_initializeUsb` function initializes the `libusb` library and retrieves the list of connected USB devices.
// 4. The `ListView.builder` widget displays each connected USB device in a list format, showing the device name and vendor ID.
// 5. The `setState` method is called to update the UI whenever the list of devices changes.
