# Understanding the `retry_bot` Flutter Package

The `retry_bot` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to implement retry logic in their applications. This package is particularly useful when dealing with network requests or operations that may fail intermittently, such as API calls or database transactions. By automatically retrying failed operations, `retry_bot` helps improve the user experience by reducing the likelihood of errors and ensuring that tasks are completed successfully.

## When to Use `retry_bot`
- **Network Requests**: When making API calls that may fail due to temporary network issues.
- **Database Operations**: For operations that may fail due to transient database errors.
- **File Operations**: When reading or writing files that may be temporarily inaccessible.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Retry Logic**: Define the number of retries and the delay between attempts.
- **Error Handling**: Easily handle errors and specify what to do on failure.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Works seamlessly with Dart's async/await syntax.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Allows for custom retry conditions and backoff strategies.

# Setting Up and Using the `retry_bot` Package

## Installation
To get started with the `retry_bot` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  retry_bot: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `retry_bot` package, you can create an instance of the `RetryBot` class and specify your retry logic. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:retry_bot/retry_bot.dart';

Future<void> fetchData() async {
  final retryBot = RetryBot(
    retries: 3, // Number of retries
    delay: Duration(seconds: 2), // Delay between retries
  );

  await retryBot.run(() async {
    // Your network request or operation here
    throw Exception('Network error'); // Simulating a failure
  });
}
```

In this example, if the operation fails, it will automatically retry up to 3 times with a 2-second delay between attempts.

# Complete Example of Using `retry_bot`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:retry_bot/retry_bot.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Retry Bot Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Retry Bot Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Call the fetchData function when the button is pressed
              await fetchData();
            },
            child: Text('Fetch Data'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    // Create an instance of RetryBot with custom settings
    final retryBot = RetryBot(
      retries: 3, // Set the number of retries
      delay: Duration(seconds: 2), // Set the delay between retries
    );

    try {
      // Run the operation with retry logic
      await retryBot.run(() async {
        // Simulating a network request that fails
        throw Exception('Network error'); // This will trigger the retry logic
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle the error after all retries have failed
      print('Failed to fetch data: $e');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled 'Fetch Data'.
// 2. When the button is pressed, the fetchData function is called.
// 3. Inside fetchData, an instance of RetryBot is created with 3 retries and a 2-second delay.
// 4. The run method of RetryBot is called, which attempts to execute the provided function.
// 5. If the function throws an exception (simulating a network error), RetryBot will automatically retry the operation up to 3 times.
// 6. If all retries fail, the error is caught, and a message is printed to the console.
```

In summary, the `retry_bot` package provides a robust solution for implementing retry logic in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, developers can easily enhance their applications' resilience against transient errors, leading to a smoother user experience.
