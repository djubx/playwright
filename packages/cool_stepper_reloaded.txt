# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Cool Stepper Reloaded

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **cool_stepper_reloaded** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **cool_stepper_reloaded** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cool_stepper_reloaded: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple stepper interface using the `RealFlutter` class.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cool_stepper_reloaded/cool_stepper_reloaded.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the stepper state:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int currentStep = 0; // Track the current step

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cool Stepper Example')),
      body: CoolStepper(
        currentStep: currentStep,
        onStepContinue: () {
          if (currentStep < 2) {
            setState(() => currentStep++);
          }
        },
        onStepCancel: () {
          if (currentStep > 0) {
            setState(() => currentStep--);
          }
        },
        steps: [
          CoolStep(
            title: "Step 1",
            content: Text("This is the content for step 1."),
          ),
          CoolStep(
            title: "Step 2",
            content: Text("This is the content for step 2."),
          ),
          CoolStep(
            title: "Step 3",
            content: Text("This is the content for step 3."),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, run your app to see the stepper in action!

# Complete Example of Cool Stepper Reloaded

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cool_stepper_reloaded/cool_stepper_reloaded.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cool Stepper Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int currentStep = 0; // Track the current step

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cool Stepper Example')),
      body: CoolStepper(
        currentStep: currentStep, // Set the current step
        onStepContinue: () {
          // Move to the next step
          if (currentStep < 2) {
            setState(() => currentStep++);
          }
        },
        onStepCancel: () {
          // Move to the previous step
          if (currentStep > 0) {
            setState(() => currentStep--);
          }
        },
        steps: [
          CoolStep(
            title: "Step 1", // Title of the first step
            content: Text("This is the content for step 1."), // Content of the first step
          ),
          CoolStep(
            title: "Step 2", // Title of the second step
            content: Text("This is the content for step 2."), // Content of the second step
          ),
          CoolStep(
            title: "Step 3", // Title of the third step
            content: Text("This is the content for step 3."), // Content of the third step
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home screen.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current step state.
// 4. The CoolStepper widget is used to create the stepper interface.
// 5. The currentStep variable tracks which step is currently active.
// 6. onStepContinue and onStepCancel methods are used to navigate between steps.
// 7. Each CoolStep contains a title and content, which can be customized as needed.
// 8. The app displays the stepper, allowing users to navigate through the steps.
```

In summary, the **cool_stepper_reloaded** package provides a straightforward way to implement stepper interfaces in Flutter applications. The example above demonstrates how to set up the package, create a simple stepper, and navigate through its steps, making it easy for users to complete multi-step processes.
