# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Glassmorphism Kit

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the glassmorphism_kit package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  glassmorphism_kit: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the `usesSwift` option in your `ios/Runner.xcodeproj` settings if you are using Swift code. Additionally, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a glassmorphism effect using the `glassmorphism_kit`.

# Complete Example of Using Glassmorphism Kit

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:glassmorphism_kit/glassmorphism_kit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Glassmorphism Kit Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: GlassContainer(
          width: 300, // Width of the glass container
          height: 200, // Height of the glass container
          blur: 10, // Blur effect
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20), // Rounded corners
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'Hello, Glassmorphism!',
              style: TextStyle(
                fontSize: 24,
                color: Colors.white,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. In HomePage, a Scaffold widget is used to provide a basic material design layout.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, a GlassContainer is created with specified width, height, blur effect, and rounded corners.
// 7. The GlassContainer holds a Text widget that displays a message, styled with white color and bold font.
// 8. The result is a visually appealing glassmorphism effect that enhances the user interface.
