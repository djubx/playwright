# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Widget and Text Animator Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `widget_and_text_animator` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  widget_and_text_animator: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `RealFlutter` class with animated text and widgets.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_and_text_animator/widget_and_text_animator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Widget and Text Animator Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animator Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Animated Text
              WidgetAnimator(
                child: Text(
                  'Welcome to RealFlutter!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                ),
                // Animation properties
                duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
                animationType: AnimationType.fadeIn,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Animated Button
              WidgetAnimator(
                child: ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Action when button is pressed
                    print('Button Pressed!');
                  },
                  child: Text('Get Started'),
                ),
                duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
                animationType: AnimationType.scale,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the animated text and button vertically.
// 5. The WidgetAnimator wraps the Text widget, applying a fade-in animation over 1 second.
// 6. Below the text, a SizedBox adds spacing, and another WidgetAnimator wraps an ElevatedButton.
// 7. The button has a scale animation and prints a message to the console when pressed.
