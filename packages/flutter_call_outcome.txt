# Flutter Call Outcome Package

The `flutter_call_outcome` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers to manage and track call outcomes in their applications. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to handle call-related events, such as making calls, receiving calls, and tracking the results of those calls. 

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `flutter_call_outcome` package in the following scenarios:

- **Telecommunication Apps**: If you are developing an app that requires making and receiving calls, this package can help you manage the outcomes of those calls effectively.
- **Customer Support Applications**: For apps that involve customer support, tracking call outcomes can provide valuable insights into customer interactions.
- **Sales and Marketing Tools**: If your app is focused on sales, understanding call outcomes can help in analyzing the effectiveness of sales calls.

## Features

- **Call Outcome Tracking**: Easily track the outcome of calls (e.g., answered, missed, rejected).
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Customizable Call Events**: Allows developers to define custom events based on call outcomes.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process that integrates well with existing Flutter applications.

Overall, the `flutter_call_outcome` package provides a robust solution for managing call outcomes, making it an essential tool for developers working on telecommunication-related applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_call_outcome

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_call_outcome` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_call_outcome` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_call_outcome: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, you need to ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to make and receive calls. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CALL_PHONE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/`:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to contacts to make calls.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the microphone to make calls.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement call outcome tracking.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_call_outcome/flutter_call_outcome.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Call Outcome Example',
      home: CallOutcomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CallOutcomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CallOutcomeScreenState createState() => _CallOutcomeScreenState();
}

class _CallOutcomeScreenState extends State<CallOutcomeScreen> {
  String _callOutcome = 'No Call Yet';

  void _makeCall() {
    // Initiate a call and track the outcome
    FlutterCallOutcome.makeCall('tel:1234567890').then((outcome) {
      setState(() {
        _callOutcome = outcome; // Update the call outcome
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Call Outcome Tracker'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Call Outcome: $_callOutcome'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _makeCall,
              child: Text('Make Call'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code Flow

1. **Importing Packages**: We import the necessary Flutter and `flutter_call_outcome` packages.
2. **Main Application**: The `MyApp` class sets up the main application structure.
3. **CallOutcomeScreen Widget**: This widget contains the UI for tracking call outcomes.
4. **State Management**: We maintain the state of the call outcome using a string variable `_callOutcome`.
5. **Making a Call**: The `_makeCall` method initiates a call and updates the outcome based on the result.
6. **UI Layout**: The UI consists of a text display for the call outcome and a button to initiate the call.

This simple application demonstrates how to use the `flutter_call_outcome` package to track call outcomes effectively.

# Complete Example of flutter_call_outcome

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_call_outcome/flutter_call_outcome.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Call Outcome Example',
      home: CallOutcomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CallOutcomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CallOutcomeScreenState createState() => _CallOutcomeScreenState();
}

class _CallOutcomeScreenState extends State<CallOutcomeScreen> {
  String _callOutcome = 'No Call Yet'; // Variable to hold the call outcome

  void _makeCall() {
    // Initiate a call and track the outcome
    FlutterCallOutcome.makeCall('tel:1234567890').then((outcome) {
      setState(() {
        _callOutcome = outcome; // Update the call outcome based on the result
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Call Outcome Tracker'), // Title of the app
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Call Outcome: $_callOutcome'), // Display the call outcome
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between text and button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _makeCall, // Call the _makeCall function when pressed
              child: Text('Make Call'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and specifies the home screen as CallOutcomeScreen.
// 3. CallOutcomeScreen maintains the state of the call outcome and provides a button to make a call.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _makeCall method is invoked, which uses the flutter_call_outcome package to initiate a call.
// 5. The outcome of the call is captured and displayed on the screen, updating the UI accordingly.
