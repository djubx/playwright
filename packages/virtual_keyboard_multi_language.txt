# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Virtual Keyboard Multi-Language Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `virtual_keyboard_multi_language` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  virtual_keyboard_multi_language: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/virtual_keyboard_multi_language).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` if required by your use case.

### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add any necessary configurations, such as permissions for keyboard usage.

2. Ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the virtual keyboard in your application, follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:virtual_keyboard_multi_language/virtual_keyboard_multi_language.dart';
   ```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the keyboard state:

   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
   }

   class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
     String inputText = '';
     String selectedLanguage = 'en'; // Default language

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Multi-Language Keyboard')),
         body: Column(
           children: [
             TextField(
               onChanged: (text) {
                 setState(() {
                   inputText = text;
                 });
               },
               decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Type here...'),
             ),
             VirtualKeyboard(
               height: 300,
               language: selectedLanguage,
               onKeyPress: (key) {
                 // Handle key press
                 setState(() {
                   inputText += key;
                 });
               },
             ),
           ],
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

3. Run your application on an emulator or physical device to see the virtual keyboard in action.

# Complete Example of Using the Virtual Keyboard Multi-Language Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:virtual_keyboard_multi_language/virtual_keyboard_multi_language.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String inputText = ''; // Variable to hold the input text
  String selectedLanguage = 'en'; // Default language set to English

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Multi-Language Keyboard')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // TextField for user input
          TextField(
            onChanged: (text) {
              setState(() {
                inputText = text; // Update input text on change
              });
            },
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Type here...'),
          ),
          // Display the current input text
          Text('Input: $inputText'),
          // Virtual keyboard widget
          VirtualKeyboard(
            height: 300, // Height of the virtual keyboard
            language: selectedLanguage, // Set the language for the keyboard
            onKeyPress: (key) {
              // Handle key press events
              setState(() {
                inputText += key; // Append the pressed key to input text
              });
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which manages the state of the input text and selected language.
// 3. A TextField is provided for user input, updating the inputText variable on change.
// 4. The current input text is displayed below the TextField.
// 5. The VirtualKeyboard widget is included, allowing users to input text using the virtual keyboard.
// 6. When a key is pressed on the virtual keyboard, the onKeyPress callback updates the inputText variable, reflecting the changes in the UI.
