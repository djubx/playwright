# Rate Limiter Flutter Package

The `rate_limiter` package for Flutter is a powerful tool designed to help developers manage the rate at which certain actions are performed in their applications. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to limit the number of requests sent to a server, control user interactions, or manage resource-intensive operations.

## When to Use

You might want to use the `rate_limiter` package in the following scenarios:

- **API Rate Limiting**: When making API calls, you may need to ensure that you do not exceed the allowed number of requests per minute/hour.
- **User Interaction Control**: To prevent users from triggering actions too frequently, such as button presses or form submissions.
- **Resource Management**: To manage the load on your application by limiting the frequency of certain operations.

## Features

- **Flexible Rate Limiting**: Set limits based on time intervals (e.g., requests per second, minute, or hour).
- **Customizable Behavior**: Define what happens when the limit is reached (e.g., ignore, queue, or throw an error).
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.

By using the `rate_limiter` package, you can enhance the performance and reliability of your Flutter applications while providing a better user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Rate Limiter Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `rate_limiter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rate_limiter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:rate_limiter/rate_limiter.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Configuration

You can create an instance of the `RateLimiter` class. Here’s how to set it up for a simple use case:

```dart
// Create a RateLimiter that allows 5 requests per minute
final rateLimiter = RateLimiter(maxRequests: 5, period: Duration(minutes: 1));
```

## Step 4: Using the Rate Limiter

You can use the `RateLimiter` instance to wrap your function calls. Here’s an example of how to use it:

```dart
void fetchData() async {
  await rateLimiter.execute(() async {
    // Your API call or resource-intensive operation
    print('Fetching data...');
  });
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 5: Testing the Rate Limiter

You can test the rate limiter by calling the `fetchData` function multiple times in quick succession. The rate limiter will ensure that only the allowed number of requests are executed within the specified time frame.

# Complete Example of Using the Rate Limiter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rate_limiter/rate_limiter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rate Limiter Example',
      home: RateLimiterDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class RateLimiterDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RateLimiterDemoState createState() => _RateLimiterDemoState();
}

class _RateLimiterDemoState extends State<RateLimiterDemo> {
  // Create a RateLimiter that allows 5 requests per minute
  final RateLimiter rateLimiter = RateLimiter(maxRequests: 5, period: Duration(minutes: 1));
  int requestCount = 0; // To keep track of the number of requests made

  // Function to fetch data
  void fetchData() async {
    await rateLimiter.execute(() async {
      // Simulate an API call
      setState(() {
        requestCount++; // Increment the request count
      });
      print('Fetching data... Request count: $requestCount');
      await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1)); // Simulate network delay
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Rate Limiter Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Requests made: $requestCount'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: fetchData, // Call fetchData on button press
              child: Text('Fetch Data'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a home screen set to RateLimiterDemo.
// 3. In RateLimiterDemo, a RateLimiter instance is created to allow 5 requests per minute.
// 4. The fetchData function is defined to execute a simulated API call using the rate limiter.
// 5. When the button is pressed, fetchData is called, which checks the rate limit before executing the API call.
// 6. The request count is updated and displayed on the screen, showing how many requests have been made.
// 7. The application effectively limits the number of requests made within the specified time frame, demonstrating the rate limiter's functionality.
