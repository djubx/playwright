# Setting Up the fl_mlkit_scanning Package
------------------------------------------

To use the fl_mlkit_scanning package in your Flutter app, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your pubspec.yaml File

Add the following line to your pubspec.yaml file:

```yml
dependencies:
  fl_mlkit_scanning: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Import the Package in Your Dart File

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:fl_mlkit_scanning/fl_mlkit_scanning.dart';
```

### Step 3: Initialize the ML Kit

Initialize the ML Kit in your app:

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await MlKit.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### Step 4: Create a Scanner Widget

Create a scanner widget to scan barcodes, images, or text:

```dart
MlKitScanner(
  onScan: (result) {
    print(result);
  },
  onError: (error) {
    print(error);
  },
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

For Android, add the following lines to your AndroidManifest.xml file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />
```

For iOS, add the following lines to your Info.plist file:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs camera access to scan barcodes and images.</string>
```

  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override

}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _scanResult = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('fl_mlkit_scanning Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              MlKitScanner(
                onScan: (result) {
                  setState(() {
                    _scanResult = result;
                  });
                },
                onError: (error) {
                  print(error);
                },
              ),
              Text(_scanResult),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by initializing the ML Kit.
// The MlKitScanner widget is used to scan barcodes, images, or text.
// When a scan result is received, the _scanResult variable is updated with the result.
// The scan result is then displayed on the screen.
// If an error occurs during the scan process, the error is printed to the console.

// In summary, this code sets up a basic Flutter app with a scanner widget that uses the fl_mlkit_scanning package to scan barcodes, images, or text.
// The scan result is then displayed on the screen, and any errors that occur during the scan process are printed to the console.
