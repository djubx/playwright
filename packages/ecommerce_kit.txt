      // Set the user name
      name: 'John Doe',
      // Set the user email

    // Authenticate the user
    ecommerceKit.authenticateUser(user);

    // Authorize the user to make a purchase
    ecommerceKit.authorizeUser(user);

    // Process the payment
    ecommerceKit.processPayment(order);

    // Return the app widget tree
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ecommerce Kit Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Ecommerce Kit Demo'),

          child: Text('Welcome to the Ecommerce Kit demo!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app flow is as follows:
// 1. The user is created and authenticated.
// 2. The user is authorized to make a purchase.
// 3. The shopping cart is created and populated with items.
// 4. The order is created and populated with items from the shopping cart.
// 5. The payment is processed using the payment gateway.
// 6. The app widget tree is returned and rendered.

// This code demonstrates the key features of the ecommerce_kit package, including:
// * Product catalog management
