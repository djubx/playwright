# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `full_expandable_fab`

## Installation
To get started with the `full_expandable_fab` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  full_expandable_fab: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/full_expandable_fab).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `full_expandable_fab`, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:full_expandable_fab/full_expandable_fab.dart';
   ```

2. Create an instance of `FullExpandableFab` in your widget tree:
   ```dart
   FullExpandableFab(
     mainButton: FloatingActionButton(
       onPressed: () {
         // Main action
       },
       child: Icon(Icons.add),
     ),
     children: [
       FloatingActionButton(
         onPressed: () {
           // Action 1
         },
         child: Icon(Icons.edit),
       ),
       FloatingActionButton(
         onPressed: () {
           // Action 2
         },
         child: Icon(Icons.delete),
       ),
     ],
   );
   ```

This will create a main FAB that expands into two additional FABs when pressed.

# Complete Example of `full_expandable_fab`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:full_expandable_fab/full_expandable_fab.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Expandable FAB Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Expandable FAB Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Press the FAB to expand!'),
        ),
        // Implementing the FullExpandableFab widget
        floatingActionButton: FullExpandableFab(
          mainButton: FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Main action when the FAB is pressed
              print('Main FAB pressed');
            },
            child: Icon(Icons.add),
          ),
          children: [
            // First action button
            FloatingActionButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action 1 when the first FAB is pressed
                print('Edit action pressed');
              },
              child: Icon(Icons.edit),
            ),
            // Second action button
            FloatingActionButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action 2 when the second FAB is pressed
                print('Delete action pressed');
              },
              child: Icon(Icons.delete),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget displaying a message.
// 4. The floatingActionButton property of the Scaffold is set to FullExpandableFab.
// 5. The FullExpandableFab has a main button that prints a message when pressed.
// 6. It also contains two child FABs that print messages for edit and delete actions when pressed.
// 7. When the main FAB is pressed, it expands to show the child FABs, allowing users to select an action.
