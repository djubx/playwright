# Debounce TextField: A Flutter Package for Efficient Input Handling

The `debounce_textfield` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to optimize user input handling in their applications. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to reduce the number of events triggered by user input, such as when searching or filtering data in real-time. By implementing a debounce mechanism, it ensures that the input is processed only after the user has stopped typing for a specified duration, thus preventing unnecessary computations and API calls.

## When to Use This Package
- **Search Bars**: When implementing a search feature that queries a database or API based on user input.
- **Filtering Lists**: When filtering a list of items based on user input, reducing the number of updates to the UI.
- **Form Validation**: When validating user input in real-time without overwhelming the system with validation requests.

## Key Features
- **Debounce Functionality**: Automatically delays the input processing until the user has stopped typing for a specified duration.
- **Customizable Duration**: Allows developers to set the debounce duration according to their needs.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate with existing Flutter projects and works seamlessly with standard TextField widgets.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Debounce TextField Package

## Installation
To get started with the `debounce_textfield` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  debounce_textfield: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage
To use the `debounce_textfield` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:debounce_textfield/debounce_textfield.dart';
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
- **iOS**: For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

### Basic Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a debounced TextField in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:debounce_textfield/debounce_textfield.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Debounce TextField Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: DebounceTextField(
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Handle the input value after debounce
              print('Input: $value');
            },
            debounceDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Set debounce duration
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              hintText: 'Type something...',
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `DebounceTextField` widget is used to create a text input field that only triggers the `onChanged` callback after the user has stopped typing for 500 milliseconds.

# Complete Example of Using Debounce TextField

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:debounce_textfield/debounce_textfield.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Debounce TextField Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: DebounceTextField(
            onChanged: (value) {
              // This callback is triggered after the debounce duration
              print('Input: $value'); // Output the current input value
            },
            debounceDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Set the debounce duration
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              hintText: 'Type something...', // Placeholder text
              border: OutlineInputBorder(), // Add a border to the TextField
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered DebounceTextField.
// 3. The DebounceTextField listens for changes in the input.
// 4. When the user types, the onChanged callback is triggered only after the user stops typing for 500 milliseconds.
// 5. The current input value is printed to the console, demonstrating the debounce effect.
```

In summary, the `debounce_textfield` package provides an efficient way to handle user input in Flutter applications, particularly in scenarios where rapid input changes can lead to performance issues. By implementing a debounce mechanism, developers can ensure that their applications remain responsive and efficient.
