// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user types in the search field.
// 2. The `DebounceTextField` widget debounces the input, waiting for a short period of time (500ms by default) before calling the `onChanged` callback.
// 3. Once the debouncing period has passed, the `onChanged` callback is called with the latest text input.
// 4. In this example, we simply print the search query to the console.
// 5. When the user presses the "Clear Search" button, the search field is cleared.

// In summary, the `DebounceTextField` widget helps prevent excessive function calls by debouncing the text input, allowing for a smoother user experience.
