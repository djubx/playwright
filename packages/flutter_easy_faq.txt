# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_easy_faq

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_easy_faq` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_easy_faq` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_easy_faq: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Basic Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the FAQ feature.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_easy_faq/flutter_easy_faq.dart';
```

2. Create a list of FAQs:

```dart
final List<FAQItem> faqs = [
  FAQItem(question: "What is Flutter?", answer: "Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google."),
  FAQItem(question: "How do I install Flutter?", answer: "You can install Flutter by following the instructions on the official Flutter website."),
  // Add more FAQs as needed
];
```

3. Use the `FAQ` widget in your widget tree:

```dart
FAQ(
  faqs: faqs,
  title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
  searchHint: "Search FAQs...",
)
```

This will render a fully functional FAQ section in your app.

# Complete Example of flutter_easy_faq

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_easy_faq/flutter_easy_faq.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Easy FAQ Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: FAQPage(),
    );
  }
}

class FAQPage extends StatelessWidget {
  // Step 1: Create a list of FAQ items
  final List<FAQItem> faqs = [
    FAQItem(question: "What is Flutter?", answer: "Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google."),
    FAQItem(question: "How do I install Flutter?", answer: "You can install Flutter by following the instructions on the official Flutter website."),
    FAQItem(question: "What platforms does Flutter support?", answer: "Flutter supports mobile, web, and desktop applications."),
    // Add more FAQs as needed
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("FAQ Example"),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: FAQ(
          faqs: faqs, // Step 2: Pass the list of FAQs to the FAQ widget
          title: "Frequently Asked Questions", // Step 3: Set the title of the FAQ section
          searchHint: "Search FAQs...", // Step 4: Set the search hint text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to FAQPage, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 4. In FAQPage, we create a list of FAQItem objects containing questions and answers.
// 5. The build method of FAQPage returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 6. The body contains a Padding widget that wraps the FAQ widget.
// 7. The FAQ widget is provided with the list of FAQs, a title, and a search hint.
// 8. The FAQ widget displays the questions, allowing users to expand and view answers.
