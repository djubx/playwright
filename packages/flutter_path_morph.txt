# flutter_path_morph: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_path_morph` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create smooth animations between different shapes. This package allows you to morph paths seamlessly, making it ideal for applications that require dynamic UI elements, such as custom icons, animated buttons, or transitions between different states of a widget.

## When to Use `flutter_path_morph`
- **Dynamic UI Elements**: When you want to create interactive and visually appealing UI components that change shape based on user interaction.
- **Custom Animations**: If your application requires unique animations that are not achievable with standard Flutter widgets.
- **State Transitions**: To animate transitions between different states of a widget, enhancing the user experience.

## Key Features
- **Path Morphing**: Easily morph between different paths with smooth animations.
- **Customizable Animation Duration**: Control the speed of the morphing effect to fit your design needs.
- **Support for Various Shapes**: Works with a wide range of shapes, including circles, rectangles, and custom paths.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates well with existing Flutter projects.

Overall, `flutter_path_morph` is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with advanced path animations.

# flutter_path_morph: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_path_morph`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_path_morph: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_path_morph).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your animations require any specific capabilities. However, for basic usage, no additional configurations are necessary.

## Basic Usage
To use `flutter_path_morph`, you will typically create a widget that utilizes the `PathMorph` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_path_morph/flutter_path_morph.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Define the initial and target paths
  Path _initialPath;
  Path _targetPath;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize paths
    _initialPath = Path()..addOval(Rect.fromCircle(center: Offset(100, 100), radius: 50));
    _targetPath = Path()..addRect(Rect.fromLTWH(50, 50, 100, 100));
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Path Morph Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: PathMorph(
          path: _initialPath,
          targetPath: _targetPath,
          duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple application that morphs a circle into a rectangle over one second. The `PathMorph` widget takes care of the animation for us.

# Complete Example of flutter_path_morph

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_path_morph/flutter_path_morph.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Define the initial and target paths
  Path _initialPath;
  Path _targetPath;
  bool _isMorphing = false; // State variable to track morphing

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize paths
    _initialPath = Path()..addOval(Rect.fromCircle(center: Offset(100, 100), radius: 50));
    _targetPath = Path()..addRect(Rect.fromLTWH(50, 50, 100, 100));
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Path Morph Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: GestureDetector(
          onTap: () {
            // Toggle morphing state on tap
            setState(() {
              _isMorphing = !_isMorphing;
            });
          },
          child: PathMorph(
            path: _isMorphing ? _targetPath : _initialPath, // Change path based on state
            duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Animation duration
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with a circular path defined in _initialPath.
// 2. When the user taps on the screen, the onTap callback is triggered.
// 3. The state variable _isMorphing toggles between true and false.
// 4. Depending on the value of _isMorphing, the PathMorph widget displays either the initial circular path or the target rectangular path.
// 5. The morphing animation occurs over a duration of one second, creating a smooth transition between the two shapes.
