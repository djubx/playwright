# File Local Storage Inspector Flutter Package

The `file_local_storage_inspector` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers inspect and manage local file storage in their Flutter applications. This package provides a user-friendly interface to view, delete, and manage files stored on the device, making it an essential tool for debugging and optimizing file storage usage.

## When to Use This Package

- **Debugging**: When you need to inspect the files created by your application, especially during development.
- **File Management**: If your app generates or uses a significant amount of local files, this package can help manage them effectively.
- **User Support**: When users report issues related to file storage, you can use this package to quickly diagnose and resolve problems.

## Features

- **File Listing**: Easily list all files in the local storage.
- **File Deletion**: Provide functionality to delete files directly from the app.
- **File Inspection**: View file details such as size, path, and modification date.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

This package is particularly useful for applications that rely heavily on local file storage, such as media apps, document management systems, or any app that generates temporary files.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the File Local Storage Inspector

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `file_local_storage_inspector` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  file_local_storage_inspector: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read and write to external storage. Update your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to manage files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents folder to manage files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `FileLocalStorageInspector` in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:file_local_storage_inspector/file_local_storage_inspector.dart';
```

2. Initialize the inspector in your main widget:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('File Local Storage Inspector')),
        body: FileLocalStorageInspector(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This will create a basic app with a file storage inspector interface.

# Complete Example of File Local Storage Inspector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:file_local_storage_inspector/file_local_storage_inspector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'File Local Storage Inspector',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('File Local Storage Inspector'),
        ),
        body: FileLocalStorageInspector(), // Displays the file inspector
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts by running the main function, which initializes the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a body.
// The body contains the FileLocalStorageInspector widget, which provides the interface for inspecting local files.
// Users can view, delete, and manage files directly from this interface, making it easy to debug and optimize file storage usage.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->
``` 

### Summary of Application Flow

// The application begins execution in the `main` function, which calls `runApp` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget constructs a `MaterialApp`, setting the title and theme for the app.
// Within the `MaterialApp`, a `Scaffold` is created, which includes an `AppBar` with the title "File Local Storage Inspector".
// The body of the `Scaffold` contains the `FileLocalStorageInspector` widget, which provides the functionality to inspect and manage local files.
// This setup allows users to interact with the local file system, view file details, and perform actions like deletion, all within a user-friendly interface.
