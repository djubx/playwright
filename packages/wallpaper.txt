# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Wallpaper Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `wallpaper` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `wallpaper` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wallpaper: ^2.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SET_WALLPAPER"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SET_WALLPAPER_HINTS"/>
   ```

2. **File Access**: Ensure your app has access to the images you want to set as wallpaper.

#### iOS

For iOS, no additional configuration is required as the package primarily targets Android's wallpaper functionalities.

### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:wallpaper/wallpaper.dart';
```

## Using the Package

To set a wallpaper, you can use the `Wallpaper` class methods. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
String result;
Wallpaper.homeScreen(
  url: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  onSuccess: () {
    result = "Wallpaper set successfully!";
  },
  onError: (error) {
    result = "Error setting wallpaper: $error";
  },
);
```

This code sets an image from a URL as the home screen wallpaper and handles success and error callbacks.

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

Below is a complete example demonstrating how to use the `wallpaper` package in a Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wallpaper/wallpaper.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Wallpaper Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: WallpaperHome(),
    );
  }
}

class WallpaperHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WallpaperHomeState createState() => _WallpaperHomeState();
}

class _WallpaperHomeState extends State<WallpaperHome> {
  String _wallpaperStatus = "Idle";

  // Function to set wallpaper
  void _setWallpaper() async {
    // Start the wallpaper setting process
    String result;
    try {
      result = await Wallpaper.homeScreen(
        url: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
        onSuccess: () {
          setState(() {
            _wallpaperStatus = "Wallpaper set successfully!";
          });
        },
        onError: (error) {
          setState(() {
            _wallpaperStatus = "Error setting wallpaper: $error";
          });
        },
      );
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _wallpaperStatus = "Exception: $e";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Wallpaper Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Wallpaper Status:',
            ),
            Text(
              '$_wallpaperStatus',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _setWallpaper,
              child: Text('Set Wallpaper'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts by running the `MyApp` class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// The home screen is set to `WallpaperHome`, a stateful widget.
// The `_WallpaperHomeState` class manages the state of the home screen.
// The `_setWallpaper` function is called when the button is pressed.
// It attempts to set the wallpaper using the `Wallpaper.homeScreen` method.
// The result of the operation updates the `_wallpaperStatus` string, which is displayed on the screen.
// The UI consists of a text widget showing the status and a button to trigger the wallpaper change.
