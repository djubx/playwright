# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Wearable Rotary Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **wearable_rotary** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wearable_rotary: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your application requires access to device features. However, the **wearable_rotary** package does not require any specific permissions.

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:wearable_rotary/wearable_rotary.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Rotary Dial
You can now use the `WearableRotary` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
WearableRotary(
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle the value change
    print("Rotary value: $value");
  },
  min: 0,
  max: 100,
  initialValue: 50,
),
```

This widget will create a rotary dial that allows users to select a value between 0 and 100, starting at 50.

## Conclusion
With these steps, you can easily integrate the **wearable_rotary** package into your Flutter application. Customize the rotary dial to fit your app's design and enhance user interaction.

# Complete Example of Wearable Rotary Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wearable_rotary/wearable_rotary.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Wearable Rotary Example',
      home: RotaryHome(),
    );
  }
}

class RotaryHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RotaryHomeState createState() => _RotaryHomeState();
}

class _RotaryHomeState extends State<RotaryHome> {
  double _currentValue = 50; // Initialize the current value

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Wearable Rotary Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the current value
            Text(
              'Current Value: ${_currentValue.toStringAsFixed(0)}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Implement the rotary dial
            WearableRotary(
              onChanged: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  _currentValue = value; // Update the current value
                });
              },
              min: 0,
              max: 100,
              initialValue: _currentValue,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to RotaryHome.
// 3. RotaryHome is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current value of the rotary dial.
// 4. In the build method of _RotaryHomeState, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column displays the current value and the WearableRotary widget.
// 6. The WearableRotary widget calls onChanged whenever the dial is rotated, updating the current value and rebuilding the UI.
