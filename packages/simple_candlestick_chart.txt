## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21

    }
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Candlestick Chart

You can now create a candlestick chart by providing it with the necessary data. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the package:

// Sample data for the candlestick chart
final List<Candle> data = [
  Candle(DateTime(2024, 1, 1), 100, 110, 90, 105),
  Candle(DateTime(2024, 1, 2), 105, 115, 95, 110),
  Candle(DateTime(2024, 1, 3), 110, 120, 100, 115),
  // Add more data as needed
];

// Create the candlestick chart widget
CandlestickChart(
  data: data,
  // Customize the appearance
  upColor: Colors.green,
  downColor: Colors.red,
)
```

With these steps, you can successfully integrate the **simple_candlestick_chart** package into your Flutter application and start visualizing financial data effectively.

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Candlestick Chart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(

        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CandlestickChartWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CandlestickChartWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for the candlestick chart
    final List<Candle> data = [
      Candle(DateTime(2024, 1, 1), 100, 110, 90, 105), // Date, Open, High, Low, Close
      Candle(DateTime(2024, 1, 2), 105, 115, 95, 110),
      Candle(DateTime(2024, 1, 3), 110, 120, 100, 115),

    ];

    // Create the candlestick chart widget
    return CandlestickChart(
      data: data,
      upColor: Colors.green, // Color for upward movement
      downColor: Colors.red, // Color for downward movement
      // Additional customization can be added here
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the CandlestickChartWidget.
// 4. CandlestickChartWidget is another StatelessWidget that prepares the sample data for the candlestick chart.
// 5. The data consists of a list of Candle objects, each representing a day's trading data.
// 6. Finally, the CandlestickChart widget is created with the data and customized colors for upward and downward movements.
