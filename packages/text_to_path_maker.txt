# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Text to Path Maker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **text_to_path_maker** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  text_to_path_maker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your application requires access to specific features. However, for basic usage of the **text_to_path_maker**, no additional configurations are typically required.

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:text_to_path_maker/text_to_path_maker.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the package to convert text to paths. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
// Create a function to convert text to path
Path createTextPath(String text) {
  // Use the TextToPathMaker to create a path from the text
  return TextToPathMaker.createPath(
    text: text,
    fontSize: 40.0,
    fontFamily: 'Arial',
  );
}
```

This function takes a string and returns a `Path` object that can be used in your Flutter widgets.

# Complete Example: Flutter Application Using Text to Path Maker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_to_path_maker/text_to_path_maker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Text to Path Maker Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Text to Path Maker'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomPaint(
            size: Size(300, 200), // Set the size of the CustomPaint
            painter: TextPathPainter(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class TextPathPainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Create a path from the text
    Path textPath = createTextPath("Hello, Flutter!");

    // Set the paint style for the path
    Paint paint = Paint()
      ..color = Colors.blue // Set the color of the path
      ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke // Set the style to stroke
      ..strokeWidth = 2.0; // Set the stroke width

    // Draw the path on the canvas
    canvas.drawPath(textPath, paint);
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false; // No need to repaint
  }

  // Create a function to convert text to path
  Path createTextPath(String text) {
    // Use the TextToPathMaker to create a path from the text
    return TextToPathMaker.createPath(
      text: text,
      fontSize: 40.0,
      fontFamily: 'Arial',
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a CustomPaint widget.
// 4. The CustomPaint widget uses the TextPathPainter to draw the text path.
// 5. In the TextPathPainter, the paint method creates a path from the text "Hello, Flutter!".
// 6. A Paint object is created to define the color and style of the path.
// 7. The path is drawn on the canvas using the defined paint.
// 8. The shouldRepaint method returns false, indicating no need for repainting.
