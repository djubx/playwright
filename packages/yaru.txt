# Yaru Flutter Package Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Yaru package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding Yaru to Your Project

To get started, you need to add the Yaru package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  yaru: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/yaru).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using Yaru in Your Application

Now that you have set up the Yaru package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:yaru/yaru.dart';
```

You can now use Yaru widgets in your application. For example, you can create a simple app with a Yaru button and a themed container.

# Complete Example of Yaru Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:yaru/yaru.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Setting up the Yaru theme for the application
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Yaru Flutter Example',
      theme: yaruTheme, // Applying the Yaru theme
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Yaru Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to Yaru Flutter!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Using a Yaru button
            YaruButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Hello!'),
                    content: Text('You pressed the Yaru button!'),
                    actions: <Widget>[
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                        child: Text('Close'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a Yaru theme.
// 3. The HomePage widget is displayed as the home screen, featuring an AppBar and a centered column.
// 4. The column contains a welcome text and a Yaru button.
// 5. When the Yaru button is pressed, an AlertDialog is shown with a message and a close button.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application using the Yaru package. The application features a welcome message and a button that, when pressed, displays a dialog. The flow of the application is straightforward, allowing users to interact with the button and receive feedback through the dialog.

### Final Summary

The Yaru Flutter package provides a robust set of tools for developers looking to create visually appealing applications. By following the setup and usage instructions outlined in this blog, you can easily integrate Yaru into your Flutter projects and take advantage of its customizable themes and widgets. The complete example demonstrates how to implement a basic application flow, showcasing the ease of use and flexibility of the Yaru package.
