# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_pickers

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_pickers` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_pickers: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a date picker using the `flutter_pickers` package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pickers/flutter_pickers.dart';
```

2. Create a function to show the date picker:

```dart
void showDatePicker(BuildContext context) {
  Pickers.showDatePicker(
    context,
    title: 'Select Date',
    onConfirm: (dateTime, selectedIndex) {
      // Handle the selected date
      print('Selected date: $dateTime');
    },
  );
}
```

3. Call this function from a button or any other widget in your UI.

This setup allows you to easily integrate the `flutter_pickers` package into your Flutter application, providing a seamless experience for users to select dates, times, or custom values.

# Complete Example of flutter_pickers

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pickers/flutter_pickers.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Pickers Example',
      home: PickerHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class PickerHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Pickers Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the date picker when the button is pressed
            showDatePicker(context);
          },
          child: Text('Select Date'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showDatePicker(BuildContext context) {
    // Display the date picker
    Pickers.showDatePicker(
      context,
      title: 'Select Date',
      onConfirm: (dateTime, selectedIndex) {
        // Handle the selected date
        print('Selected date: $dateTime');
        // You can also update the UI or state here
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (PickerHomePage).
// 3. PickerHomePage contains a button that, when pressed, triggers the showDatePicker function.
// 4. showDatePicker uses the Pickers.showDatePicker method to display a date picker dialog.
// 5. When a date is selected and confirmed, the selected date is printed to the console.
// 6. You can further enhance the app by updating the UI with the selected date.
```
