# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_markdown_editor

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_markdown_editor`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_markdown_editor: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_markdown_editor).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires internet access for loading images or links.

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_markdown_editor`, you can create a simple widget that incorporates the editor. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_markdown_editor/flutter_markdown_editor.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Markdown Editor')),
        body: MarkdownEditor(
          onChanged: (String value) {
            // Handle the Markdown text changes
            print(value);
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a Markdown editor. The `onChanged` callback allows you to capture the Markdown text as it changes.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and start using the `flutter_markdown_editor` in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_markdown_editor

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_markdown_editor/flutter_markdown_editor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Markdown Editor Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Markdown Editor'),
        ),
        body: MarkdownEditor(
          // This callback is triggered when the Markdown text changes
          onChanged: (String value) {
            // Here you can handle the Markdown text
            print(value);
          },
          // Optional: Set initial text in the editor
          initialText: '# Welcome to Markdown Editor\n\nThis is a simple editor.',
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of the MarkdownEditor widget.
// 5. The onChanged callback captures any changes made in the editor and prints the Markdown text to the console.
// 6. The initialText property sets a default Markdown text that appears when the editor is first displayed.
