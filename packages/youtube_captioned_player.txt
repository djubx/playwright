```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/youtube_captioned_player).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest
       ...
   }
   ```

2. Ensure you have internet permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Basic Usage
To use the `youtube_captioned_player`, you can create a simple widget that initializes the player with a YouTube video ID and caption file URL.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:youtube_captioned_player/youtube_captioned_player.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('YouTube Captioned Player Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: YoutubeCaptionedPlayer(
          videoId: 'your_video_id', // Replace with your YouTube video ID
          captionUrl: 'your_caption_url', // Replace with your caption file URL
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic YouTube player with captions. Make sure to replace `your_video_id` and `your_caption_url` with actual values.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `youtube_captioned_player` into your Flutter application successfully.

# Complete Example of youtube_captioned_player

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:youtube_captioned_player/youtube_captioned_player.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'YouTube Captioned Player Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('YouTube Captioned Player Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: YoutubeCaptionedPlayer(
            videoId: 'your_video_id', // Replace with your YouTube video ID
            captionUrl: 'your_caption_url', // Replace with your caption file URL
            // You can customize the player further if needed
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to a Scaffold widget.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with a title and a Center widget in the body.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, the YoutubeCaptionedPlayer is instantiated.
// 6. The player takes a video ID and a caption URL as parameters, which are required for playback.
// 7. The app will display the YouTube video along with the captions when run.
