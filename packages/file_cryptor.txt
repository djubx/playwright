Here's a detailed technical blog on the "file_cryptor" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# File Cryptor Flutter Package

The **file_cryptor** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement file encryption and decryption functionalities in their applications. This package provides a simple and effective way to secure sensitive data stored in files, ensuring that unauthorized access is prevented.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the **file_cryptor** package in scenarios such as:
- **Storing sensitive user data**: If your application handles personal information, encrypting this data before saving it to disk is crucial.
- **Secure file sharing**: When sharing files between users, encrypting the files ensures that only intended recipients can access the content.
- **Compliance with data protection regulations**: Many regulations require that sensitive data be encrypted, making this package a valuable tool for compliance.

## Features

- **AES Encryption**: Utilizes the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for secure file encryption.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick implementation in any Flutter application.
- **File Handling**: Supports reading from and writing to files, making it easy to encrypt and decrypt files directly.

With these features, the **file_cryptor** package is an essential tool for any Flutter developer focused on data security.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the File Cryptor Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **file_cryptor** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  file_cryptor: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save encrypted files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents folder to save encrypted files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Hereâ€™s how to use the **file_cryptor** package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:file_cryptor/file_cryptor.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class (which we will define in the next section) to handle encryption and decryption.

3. Use the methods provided by the package to encrypt and decrypt files.

# Complete Example of Using the File Cryptor Package

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:file_cryptor/file_cryptor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'File Cryptor Example',
      home: FileCryptorDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class FileCryptorDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FileCryptorDemoState createState() => _FileCryptorDemoState();
}

class _FileCryptorDemoState extends State<FileCryptorDemo> {
  final FileCryptor _fileCryptor = FileCryptor();
  String _status = "Ready to encrypt/decrypt";

  // Method to encrypt a file
  Future<void> _encryptFile() async {
    // Define the file path and the key for encryption
    String filePath = 'path/to/your/file.txt'; // Change this to your file path
    String key = 'your-encryption-key'; // Use a secure key

    try {
      // Encrypt the file
      await _fileCryptor.encryptFile(filePath, key);
      setState(() {
        _status = "File encrypted successfully!";
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _status = "Error encrypting file: $e";
      });
    }
  }

  // Method to decrypt a file
  Future<void> _decryptFile() async {
    // Define the file path and the key for decryption
    String filePath = 'path/to/your/encrypted_file.txt'; // Change this to your encrypted file path
    String key = 'your-encryption-key'; // Use the same key used for encryption

    try {
      // Decrypt the file
      await _fileCryptor.decryptFile(filePath, key);
      setState(() {
        _status = "File decrypted successfully!";
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _status = "Error decrypting file: $e";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('File Cryptor Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_status),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _encryptFile,
              child: Text('Encrypt File'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _decryptFile,
              child: Text('Decrypt File'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (FileCryptorDemo).
// 3. FileCryptorDemo is a stateful widget that manages the encryption and decryption process.
// 4. The _encryptFile method is called when the "Encrypt File" button is pressed.
//    - It defines the file path and encryption key, then calls the encryptFile method from the FileCryptor instance.
// 5. The _decryptFile method is called when the "Decrypt File" button is pressed.
//    - It defines the file path of the encrypted file and the same key used for encryption, then calls the decryptFile method.
// 6. The status of the operation is displayed on the screen, updating based on success or failure.
```
