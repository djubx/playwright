# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_storage_path

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_storage_path` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_storage_path: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following permissions to allow access to external storage:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for accessing the user's files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save images.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to save files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve storage paths.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_storage_path/flutter_storage_path.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Storage Path Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Retrieve the path for the documents directory
              String? documentsPath = await FlutterStoragePath.getDocumentsPath();
              // Display the path in a dialog
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Documents Path'),
                  content: Text(documentsPath ?? 'Path not found'),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                      child: Text('OK'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Get Documents Path'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the app retrieves the documents path and displays it in a dialog.

# Complete Example of flutter_storage_path

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_storage_path/flutter_storage_path.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Storage Path Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Retrieve the path for the documents directory
              String? documentsPath = await FlutterStoragePath.getDocumentsPath();
              // Display the path in a dialog
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Documents Path'),
                  content: Text(documentsPath ?? 'Path not found'),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                      child: Text('OK'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Get Documents Path'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. The home widget is a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers an asynchronous function to get the documents path.
// 5. The path is retrieved using FlutterStoragePath.getDocumentsPath().
// 6. Once the path is obtained, a dialog is displayed showing the documents path.
// 7. The user can dismiss the dialog by pressing the 'OK' button.
```
