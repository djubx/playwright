# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the File System Access API

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `file_system_access_api` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  file_system_access_api: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsDirectoryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your documents directory.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to use the `file_system_access_api` package to select and read a file.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:file_system_access_api/file_system_access_api.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('File System Access Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Open a file picker dialog
              final file = await FileSystemAccessApi.openFile();
              if (file != null) {
                // Read the contents of the file
                final contents = await file.readAsString();
                // Display the contents
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('File Contents'),
                    content: Text(contents),
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                        child: Text('Close'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Select a File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that allows users to select a file and display its contents in a dialog.

# Complete Example of File System Access API

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:file_system_access_api/file_system_access_api.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('File System Access Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Open a file picker dialog
              final file = await FileSystemAccessApi.openFile();
              if (file != null) {
                // Read the contents of the file
                final contents = await file.readAsString();
                // Display the contents in a dialog
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('File Contents'),
                    content: Text(contents),
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                        child: Text('Close'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Select a File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. The home of the app is a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton labeled 'Select a File'.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback.
// 5. The callback calls FileSystemAccessApi.openFile() to open a file picker dialog.
// 6. If a file is selected, it reads the file's contents as a string.
// 7. The contents are then displayed in an AlertDialog for the user to view.
// 8. The user can close the dialog by pressing the 'Close' button.
```
