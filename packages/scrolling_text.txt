# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Scrolling Text Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `scrolling_text` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scrolling_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement scrolling text.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scrolling_text/scrolling_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Scrolling Text Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ScrollingText(
            text: 'Welcome to the Scrolling Text Package!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.blue),
            speed: 50, // Speed of the scrolling text
            direction: Axis.horizontal, // Direction of scrolling
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays scrolling text in the center of the screen. You can customize the text, style, speed, and direction as needed.

# Complete Example of Scrolling Text in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scrolling_text/scrolling_text.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Scrolling Text Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ScrollingText(
            text: 'Welcome to the Scrolling Text Package!', // Text to scroll
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.blue), // Text style
            speed: 50, // Speed of the scrolling text
            direction: Axis.horizontal, // Direction of scrolling
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the basic structure of the app.
3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which includes an AppBar and a body.
4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
5. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child, which is the ScrollingText widget.
6. The ScrollingText widget takes several parameters:
   - text: The string that will be displayed and scrolled.
   - style: The TextStyle that defines the appearance of the text.
   - speed: Controls how fast the text scrolls across the screen.
   - direction: Specifies the direction of the scrolling (horizontal in this case).
7. When the app runs, the text will scroll continuously across the screen, providing a dynamic and engaging user experience.
