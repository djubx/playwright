# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_mask_view`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_mask_view` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_mask_view: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, especially if you are using features that require camera or photo library access.

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to display images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take pictures.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a masked view.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_mask_view/flutter_mask_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Mask View Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: MaskedView(
            mask: CircleMask(), // Using a circular mask
            child: Image.network(
              'https://example.com/image.jpg',
              fit: BoxFit.cover,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple application that displays an image with a circular mask applied to it. The `MaskedView` widget takes a `mask` parameter, which defines the shape of the mask.

# Complete Example of `flutter_mask_view`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_mask_view/flutter_mask_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Mask View Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the masked view in the middle of the screen
          child: MaskedView(
            mask: CircleMask(), // Applying a circular mask
            child: Image.network(
              'https://example.com/image.jpg', // Image to be masked
              fit: BoxFit.cover, // Ensuring the image covers the entire area
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget holds a MaskedView, which applies a circular mask to the child widget.
// 6. The child of the MaskedView is an Image widget that loads an image from the network.
// 7. The image is set to cover the entire masked area, creating a visually appealing effect.
```
