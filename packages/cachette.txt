# Exploring the Cachette Flutter Package

The **Cachette** package is a lightweight and efficient caching solution for Flutter applications. It provides a simple API for storing and retrieving data, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their app's performance by reducing network calls and improving data retrieval times.

## When to Use Cachette
Cachette is particularly useful in scenarios where:
- You need to cache API responses to minimize network requests.
- You want to store user preferences or settings locally.
- You require a quick way to persist data across app sessions without complex database setups.

## Key Features
- **Simple API**: Cachette offers an intuitive API that makes it easy to store and retrieve data.
- **In-Memory and Persistent Caching**: Supports both in-memory caching for quick access and persistent storage for data that needs to survive app restarts.
- **Automatic Expiration**: You can set expiration times for cached data, ensuring that stale data is not used.
- **Type Safety**: Cachette is designed with type safety in mind, reducing runtime errors.

With these features, Cachette stands out as a robust solution for caching in Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using Cachette

## Installation
To add Cachette to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cachette: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you plan to access any sensitive data.

## Basic Usage
To use Cachette, you need to create an instance of the `Cachette` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to store and retrieve data:

```dart
import 'package:cachette/cachette.dart';

void main() {
  // Create an instance of Cachette
  final cache = Cachette();

  // Store a value
  cache.set('username', 'JohnDoe');

  // Retrieve the value
  final username = cache.get('username');
  print(username); // Output: JohnDoe
}
```

This example demonstrates the basic operations of storing and retrieving data using Cachette. You can also set expiration times and manage cached data efficiently.

# Complete Example of Cachette in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cachette/cachette.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cachette Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  final Cachette cache = Cachette(); // Create an instance of Cachette
  String? username; // Variable to hold the cached username

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load the cached username when the app starts
    username = cache.get('username');
  }

  void _saveUsername(String name) {
    // Save the username to cache
    cache.set('username', name);
    setState(() {
      username = name; // Update the state to reflect the new username
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Cachette Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              username != null ? 'Hello, $username!' : 'No username set.',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            TextField(
              onSubmitted: _saveUsername, // Save username on submission
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter your username',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a HomeScreen as its home.
// 3. In HomeScreen, we create an instance of Cachette to manage cached data.
// 4. During initialization (initState), we attempt to load a cached username.
// 5. The build method displays a greeting message based on the cached username.
// 6. A TextField allows users to input their username, which is saved to cache on submission.
// 7. The state is updated to reflect the new username, and the UI is rebuilt accordingly.
