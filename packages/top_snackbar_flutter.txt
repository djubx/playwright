# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Top Snackbar Flutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `top_snackbar_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  top_snackbar_flutter: ^0.2.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:top_snackbar_flutter/top_snack_bar.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Snackbar

You can use the snackbar in your Flutter application by calling the `showTopSnackBar` function. Here’s how to do it:

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the correct configurations. Typically, no special configurations are needed for this package, but ensure your app has the necessary permissions for notifications if you plan to use them.

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Example Usage

You can call the snackbar from anywhere in your widget tree. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
showTopSnackBar(
  context,
  CustomSnackBar.success(
    message: "This is a success message!",
  ),
);
```

This will display a success snackbar at the top of the screen with the specified message.

### Additional Customization

You can customize the snackbar further by changing its duration, background color, and more. For example:

```dart
showTopSnackBar(
  context,
  CustomSnackBar.info(
    message: "This is an info message!",
    backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
    duration: Duration(seconds: 5),
  ),
);
```

This will show an info snackbar with a blue background for 5 seconds.

With these steps, you can easily integrate and use the `top_snackbar_flutter` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Top Snackbar Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:top_snackbar_flutter/top_snack_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Top Snackbar Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Top Snackbar Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // When the button is pressed, show a success snackbar
            showTopSnackBar(
              context,
              CustomSnackBar.success(
                message: "This is a success message!",
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Success Snackbar'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the showTopSnackBar function is called, displaying a success snackbar at the top of the screen with the message "This is a success message!".
// 5. The snackbar appears for a short duration, providing feedback to the user without interrupting their workflow.
