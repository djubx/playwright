    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `social_embed_webview` package, you can create a simple widget that takes a URL of a social media post and displays it in a web view.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:social_embed_webview/social_embed_webview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Social Embed WebView Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SocialEmbedWebView(
            url: 'https://twitter.com/your_tweet_url',
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(

          ),

}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with a title and a body.
// 5. The body is centered and contains the SocialEmbedWebView widget.
// 6. The SocialEmbedWebView widget takes a URL as a parameter, which is the link to the social media post.
// 7. When the app runs, it displays the embedded social media post directly within the app interface.
