# Tutorial
To use the `banner_listtile` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Here are the steps:

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project
Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  banner_listtile: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to get the package.

## Step 2: Import the Package
Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:banner_listtile/banner_listtile.dart';
```
## Step 3: Use the Package
To use the package, you need to create a `BannerListTile` widget and pass the required parameters. Here is an example:
```dart
BannerListTile(
  title: Text('Banner Title'),
  subtitle: Text('Banner Subtitle'),
  trailing: Icon(Icons.chevron_right),
  children: [
    ListTile(
      title: Text('List Item 1'),
    ),
    ListTile(
      title: Text('List Item 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```
This will display a banner with a title, subtitle, and a trailing icon, followed by a list of two items.

## Platform-Specific Details
The package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to adjust the appearance of the banner and the list items to match the platform's design guidelines.

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Banner List Tile Demo'),
      ),
      body: BannerListTile(
        // Display a banner with a title, subtitle, and a trailing icon
        title: Text('Banner Title'),
        subtitle: Text('Banner Subtitle'),
        trailing: Icon(Icons.chevron_right),
        // Display a list of three items
        children: [
          ListTile(
            // Display the first list item with a title and a subtitle
            title: Text('List Item 1'),
            subtitle: Text('List Item 1 Subtitle'),
          ),
          ListTile(
            // Display the second list item with a title and a subtitle
            title: Text('List Item 2'),
            subtitle: Text('List Item 2 Subtitle'),
          ),
          ListTile(
            // Display the third list item with a title and a subtitle
            title: Text('List Item 3'),
            subtitle: Text('List Item 3 Subtitle'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a material app with a title and a theme.
// 2. The user is then presented with a scaffold that contains an app bar with a title.
// 3. Below the app bar, the user is presented with a banner list tile that displays a banner with a title, subtitle, and a trailing icon.
// 4. Below the banner, the user is presented with a list of three items, each with a title and a subtitle.
// 5. The user can then interact with the list items as needed.
