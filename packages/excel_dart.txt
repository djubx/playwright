### Tutorial

#### Installation

To get started with the `excel_dart` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  excel_dart: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

#### Platform-Specific Configuration

For both Android and iOS, no additional configuration is required to use the `excel_dart` package. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

#### Basic Usage

Here’s how to use the `excel_dart` package in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the Package**: Start by importing the package in your Dart file.

   ```dart
   import 'package:excel_dart/excel_dart.dart';
   ```

2. **Reading an Excel File**: You can read an Excel file using the following code snippet:

   ```dart
   var file = 'path_to_your_file.xlsx';
   var bytes = File(file).readAsBytesSync();
   var excel = Excel.decodeBytes(bytes);
   ```

3. **Writing to an Excel File**: To create a new Excel file or modify an existing one, use:

   ```dart
   var excel = Excel.createExcel(); // Create a new Excel file
   Sheet sheet = excel['Sheet1'];
   sheet.appendRow(['Header1', 'Header2', 'Header3']);
   ```

4. **Saving the File**: Finally, save the Excel file to the desired location:

   ```dart
   var fileBytes = excel.save();
   File('path_to_save_file.xlsx')
     ..createSync(recursive: true)
     ..writeAsBytesSync(fileBytes!);
   ```

### Complete Example

Here’s a complete Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the `excel_dart` package:

```dart
import 'dart:io'; // Importing the dart:io library for file operations
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Importing Flutter material package
import 'package:excel_dart/excel_dart.dart'; // Importing the excel_dart package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Excel Dart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Excel Dart Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the function to create and save an Excel file
              createExcelFile();
            },
            child: Text('Create Excel File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void createExcelFile() {
    // Create a new Excel file
    var excel = Excel.createExcel();
    Sheet sheet = excel['Sheet1']; // Accessing the first sheet

    // Adding headers to the first row
    sheet.appendRow(['Name', 'Age', 'Email']);
    // Adding some sample data
    sheet.appendRow(['John Doe', 30, 'john@example.com']);
    sheet.appendRow(['Jane Smith', 25, 'jane@example.com']);

    // Saving the Excel file
    var fileBytes = excel.save();
    File('example.xlsx') // Specify the file name
      ..createSync(recursive: true) // Create the file if it doesn't exist
      ..writeAsBytesSync(fileBytes!); // Write the bytes to the file

    print('Excel file created successfully!'); // Log success message
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget builds a simple UI with an AppBar and a button.
// When the button is pressed, it triggers the `createExcelFile` function.
// Inside `createExcelFile`, a new Excel file is created using `Excel.createExcel()`.
// The first sheet is accessed, and headers are added to the first row.
// Sample data is appended to the sheet.
// Finally, the Excel file is saved to the device with the name 'example.xlsx'.
// A success message is printed to the console once the file is created.
