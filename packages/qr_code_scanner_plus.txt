# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using QR Code Scanner Plus

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `qr_code_scanner_plus` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `qr_code_scanner_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  qr_code_scanner_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/qr_code_scanner_plus).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add camera permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:
   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera to scan QR codes.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement QR code scanning.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:qr_code_scanner_plus/qr_code_scanner_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'QR Code Scanner Plus Example',
      home: QRViewExample(),
    );
  }
}

class QRViewExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _QRViewExampleState createState() => _QRViewExampleState();
}

class _QRViewExampleState extends State<QRViewExample> {
  // Create a GlobalKey to manage the QR view
  final GlobalKey qrKey = GlobalKey(debugLabel: 'QR');
  QRViewController? controller;

  @override
  void reassemble() {
    super.reassemble();
    // If the app is resumed, restart the camera
    if (controller != null) {
      controller!.resumeCamera();
    }
  }

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the QR controller
    controller = QRViewController(qrKey, onQRViewCreated);
  }

  void onQRViewCreated(QRViewController controller) {
    // Set the controller to listen for scanned QR codes
    controller.scannedDataStream.listen((scanData) {
      // Show the scanned data in a dialog
      showDialog(
        context: context,
        builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
          title: Text('Scanned QR Code'),
          content: Text(scanData.code),
          actions: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
              child: Text('OK'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      );
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed
    controller?.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('QR Code Scanner Plus'),
      ),
      body: QRView(
        key: qrKey,
        onQRViewCreated: onQRViewCreated,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple QR code scanner application using the qr_code_scanner_plus package.
// 
// 1. **Main Function**: The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. **RealFlutter Widget**: This is the main widget of the application, which sets up the MaterialApp and the home screen.
// 3. **QRViewExample Widget**: This stateful widget manages the QR code scanning functionality.
// 4. **GlobalKey**: A GlobalKey is created to manage the QR view.
// 5. **QRViewController**: The controller is initialized in the `initState` method, which handles the QR scanning logic.
// 6. **onQRViewCreated**: This method is called when the QR view is created. It sets up a listener for scanned QR codes and displays the scanned data in a dialog.
// 7. **dispose Method**: The controller is disposed of when the widget is removed to free up resources.
// 8. **Build Method**: The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and the QRView widget, which displays the camera view for scanning QR codes.

// In summary, this application initializes a QR code scanner, listens for scanned codes, and displays the results in a dialog. The user can scan QR codes in real-time, making it a practical implementation of the `qr_code_scanner_plus` package.
