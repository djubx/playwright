# Exploring the Lunar Flutter Package

The **Lunar** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate lunar phase calculations and related functionalities into their applications. This package is particularly useful for apps that require astronomical data, such as gardening apps, astrology apps, or any application that benefits from lunar cycle information.

## When to Use Lunar
- **Gardening Applications**: To determine the best planting times based on lunar phases.
- **Astrology Apps**: To provide users with insights based on lunar cycles.
- **Educational Apps**: To teach users about the moon's phases and their significance.

## Key Features
- **Lunar Phase Calculation**: Easily calculate the current lunar phase.
- **Lunar Calendar**: Access a calendar view of lunar phases for any given month.
- **Custom Date Queries**: Retrieve lunar phase information for specific dates.
- **User-Friendly API**: Simple and intuitive methods for developers to implement.

# Setting Up the Lunar Package

To get started with the Lunar package, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file.
2. Add the Lunar package dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     lunar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

3. Run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you plan to access location services or other features that require user permissions.

## Basic Usage

To use the Lunar package, you can start by importing it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:lunar/lunar.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `Lunar` class and use its methods to get lunar phase information.

# Complete Example of Using the Lunar Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lunar/lunar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Lunar Phase App',
      home: LunarHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class LunarHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LunarHomePageState createState() => _LunarHomePageState();
}

class _LunarHomePageState extends State<LunarHomePage> {
  String _lunarPhase = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getLunarPhase(); // Fetch the lunar phase when the app starts
  }

  void _getLunarPhase() {
    // Get the current date
    DateTime now = DateTime.now();
    // Create a Lunar object for the current date
    Lunar lunar = Lunar.fromDate(now);
    // Get the lunar phase description
    setState(() {
      _lunarPhase = lunar.phase; // Update the state with the lunar phase
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Lunar Phase Today'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Current Lunar Phase: $_lunarPhase',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (LunarHomePage).
// 3. LunarHomePage is a stateful widget that manages its state.
// 4. In the initState method, _getLunarPhase is called to fetch the current lunar phase.
// 5. _getLunarPhase creates a Lunar object for the current date and retrieves the lunar phase.
// 6. The state is updated with the lunar phase, which triggers a rebuild of the widget.
// 7. The build method displays the current lunar phase in the center of the screen.
