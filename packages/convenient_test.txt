# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Convenient Test

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **convenient_test** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **convenient_test** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under `dev_dependencies`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  convenient_test: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file includes the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    testOptions {
        unitTests.all {
            useJUnitPlatform()
        }
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Runner.xcodeproj` settings to ensure compatibility with the testing framework. Make sure to enable the following:

- Enable "Test" under the "Build Settings" for your target.

## Step 3: Writing Tests

Now that you have set up the package, you can start writing tests. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the **convenient_test** package to test a Flutter widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:convenient_test/convenient_test.dart';
import 'package:your_app/main.dart'; // Import your main app file

void main() {
  testWidgets('MyWidget has a title and message', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Build our app and trigger a frame.
    await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp());

    // Verify that our widget displays a title and message.
    expect(find.text('Welcome'), findsOneWidget);
    expect(find.text('Hello, World!'), findsOneWidget);
  });
});
```

In this example, we are testing a widget to ensure it displays the correct title and message. The **convenient_test** package simplifies the process of writing this test.

# Complete Example: RealFlutter Application

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the **convenient_test** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:convenient_test/convenient_test.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Convenient Test Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Convenient Test Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Welcome'),
              Text('Hello, World!'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function initializes the app and takes the RealFlutter widget as an argument.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI of the app.
// 4. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a title and a Scaffold.
// 5. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title and a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 6. The body of the Center widget contains a Column that displays two Text widgets: "Welcome" and "Hello, World!".
// 7. This simple structure allows us to test the UI components using the convenient_test package.
```
