# Graph Collection Flutter Package
=====================================

The `graph_collection` Flutter package is a powerful tool for creating and managing graph data structures in your Flutter applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to work with graphs, allowing you to focus on the logic of your app rather than the underlying data structure.

### When to Use This Package

This package is ideal for apps that require complex relationships between data entities, such as:

* Social network analysis
* Recommendation systems
* Traffic routing
* Network topology

### Features

* Support for directed and undirected graphs
* Efficient node and edge management
* Built-in algorithms for graph traversal and manipulation
* Customizable graph visualization

# Setting Up the Graph Collection Package
==========================================

To use the `graph_collection` package in your Flutter app, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec File

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  graph_collection: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:
```dart
import 'package:graph_collection/graph_collection.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create a Graph Instance

Create a new instance of the `Graph` class:
```dart
Graph graph = Graph();
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* For Android, you may need to add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```
* For iOS, you may need to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSFileProtectionKey</key>
<string>NSFileProtectionNone</string>
```
### Configurations and Optimizations

* To improve performance, you can configure the graph to use a specific storage engine:
```dart
graph.storageEngine = StorageEngine.memory;
```
* To customize the graph visualization, you can use the `GraphVisualizer` class:
```dart
GraphVisualizer visualizer = GraphVisualizer(graph);
```

                  print('Edge added!');
                },
                child: Text('Add Edge'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Traverse the graph
                  graph.traverse((node) {
                    print('Visited node: $node');
                  });
                },
                child: Text('Traverse Graph'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a simple UI.
// 2. The user clicks the "Add Node" button, which adds a new node to the graph.
// 3. The user clicks the "Add Edge" button, which adds a new edge to the graph.
// 4. The user clicks the "Traverse Graph" button, which traverses the graph and prints the visited nodes.
// The graph is stored in memory and is updated in real-time as the user interacts with the app.

// Final summary: This code demonstrates the basic usage of the graph_collection package in a Flutter app. It creates a simple UI that allows the user to add nodes and edges to a graph, and traverse the graph. The graph is stored in memory and is updated in real-time as the user interacts with the app.
