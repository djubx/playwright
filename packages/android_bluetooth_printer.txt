# Complete Example of Using android_bluetooth_printer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:android_bluetooth_printer/android_bluetooth_printer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bluetooth Printer Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final AndroidBluetoothPrinter printer = AndroidBluetoothPrinter();
  List<BluetoothDevice> devices = [];
  BluetoothDevice? selectedDevice;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Bluetooth printer
    initPrinter();
  }

  void initPrinter() async {
    // Get the list of available Bluetooth devices
    devices = await printer.getBondedDevices();
    setState(() {});
  }

  void printReceipt() async {
    if (selectedDevice != null) {
      // Connect to the selected Bluetooth printer
      await printer.connect(selectedDevice!);
      // Print a sample receipt
      await printer.printCustom("Receipt Title", 2, 1);
      await printer.printNewLine();
      await printer.printCustom("Item 1: \$10.00", 1, 0);
      await printer.printCustom("Item 2: \$15.00", 1, 0);
      await printer.printNewLine();
      await printer.printCustom("Total: \$25.00", 2, 1);
      await printer.printNewLine();
      // Disconnect after printing
      await printer.disconnect();
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Bluetooth Printer Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          DropdownButton<BluetoothDevice>(
            hint: Text("Select Printer"),
            value: selectedDevice,
            onChanged: (BluetoothDevice? device) {
              setState(() {
                selectedDevice = device;
              });
            },
            items: devices.map((BluetoothDevice device) {
              return DropdownMenuItem<BluetoothDevice>(
                value: device,
                child: Text(device.name!),
              );
            }).toList(),
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: printReceipt,
            child: Text("Print Receipt"),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
// The application starts by initializing the Bluetooth printer and fetching the list of bonded devices.
// The user can select a printer from a dropdown menu.
// When the "Print Receipt" button is pressed, the app connects to the selected printer,
// sends print commands to print a sample receipt, and then disconnects from the printer.
// This flow allows for easy integration of Bluetooth printing in a Flutter application.
