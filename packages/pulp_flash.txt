- Providing contextual information without interrupting the user experience.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily customize the look and feel of the flash messages to match your app's theme.
- **Animation Support**: The package supports various animations for showing and hiding messages, enhancing user experience.
- **Flexible Positioning**: Flash messages can be displayed at different positions on the screen, allowing for better visibility based on your app's layout.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Pulp Flash

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **pulp_flash** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pulp_flash: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for certain permissions if your flash messages require them. However, for basic usage, no specific configurations are necessary.

## Step 3: Using Pulp Flash in Your Application

To use the **pulp_flash** package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:pulp_flash/pulp_flash.dart';
```

You can then create a flash message using the `PulpFlash` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display a success message:

```dart
PulpFlash.show(
  context,
  message: 'Operation Successful!',
  type: FlashType.success,
);
```

You can customize the message, type, duration, and position as needed.

## Step 4: Example Usage

In the next section, we will provide a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates how to use the **pulp_flash** package effectively.

# Complete Example of Pulp Flash in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pulp_flash/pulp_flash.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pulp Flash Example',
      home: FlashExample(),
    );
  }
}

class FlashExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pulp Flash Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a success flash message when the button is pressed
            PulpFlash.show(
              context,
              message: 'Operation Successful!',
              type: FlashType.success,
              duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Message will be shown for 2 seconds
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Flash Message'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. The FlashExample widget is displayed as the home screen, containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the PulpFlash.show method is called to display a success message.
// 6. The message is shown for 2 seconds before disappearing, providing feedback to the user about the operation's success.
```
