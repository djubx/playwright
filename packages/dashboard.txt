# Tutorial: Setting Up the Dashboard Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the dashboard Flutter package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the dashboard package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dashboard: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Dashboard Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a dashboard using the `RealFlutter` class.

# Complete Example of Using the Dashboard Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dashboard/dashboard.dart'; // Import the dashboard package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dashboard Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DashboardScreen(), // Set the home screen to DashboardScreen
    );
  }
}

class DashboardScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dashboard'), // Title of the dashboard
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0), // Add padding around the dashboard
        child: GridView.count(
          crossAxisCount: 2, // Number of columns in the grid
          children: <Widget>[
            DashboardCard(
              title: 'Sales',
              value: '1500',
              icon: Icons.attach_money,
            ),
            DashboardCard(
              title: 'Users',
              value: '300',
              icon: Icons.people,
            ),
            DashboardCard(
              title: 'Orders',
              value: '75',
              icon: Icons.shopping_cart,
            ),
            DashboardCard(
              title: 'Revenue',
              value: '\$5000',
              icon: Icons.trending_up,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// DashboardCard widget to display individual cards in the dashboard
class DashboardCard extends StatelessWidget {
  final String title;
  final String value;
  final IconData icon;

  DashboardCard({required this.title, required this.value, required this.icon});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      elevation: 4, // Shadow effect for the card
      child: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0), // Padding inside the card
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Center the content
          children: <Widget>[
            Icon(icon, size: 40), // Display the icon
            SizedBox(height: 10), // Space between icon and title
            Text(title, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20)), // Title of the card
            SizedBox(height: 5), // Space between title and value
            Text(value, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)), // Value of the card
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter app.
The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
The DashboardScreen is set as the home screen, which contains a GridView to display multiple DashboardCard widgets.
Each DashboardCard displays an icon, title, and value, representing different metrics.
The layout is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes by using a grid layout.
*/
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple dashboard application using the dashboard Flutter package. The `RealFlutter` class initializes the app, and the `DashboardScreen` class contains a grid of `DashboardCard` widgets, each representing different metrics. The application is structured to be responsive and visually appealing, making it easy to present data effectively.

In summary, the code flows from the main function to the `RealFlutter` class, which sets up the MaterialApp. The `DashboardScreen` builds a grid layout containing multiple cards, each displaying relevant information. The use of padding and grid layout ensures that the dashboard is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
