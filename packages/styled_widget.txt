**Setup and Usage**
=====================

To use the `styled_widget` package, you will need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file. You can do this by adding the following line to the `dependencies` section:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  styled_widget: ^1.0.0
```

Once you have added the package to your project, you can import it into your Dart files using the following line:

```dart
import 'package:styled_widget/styled_widget.dart';
```

**Basic Usage**
----------------

To use the `styled_widget` package, you can simply wrap your widgets in a `Styled.widget` widget. This will allow you to customize the appearance of your widgets using the package's API.

Here is an example of how to use the `Styled.widget` widget:

```dart
Styled.widget(
  child: Text('Hello, World!'),
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
)
```

**Platform-Specific Details**
-----------------------------

The `styled_widget` package is compatible with both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details to be aware of:

*   On Android, the package uses the `android.widget.TextView` class to render text. This means that you can use the `android:fontFamily` attribute to customize the font family used by your text widgets.
*   On iOS, the package uses the `UILabel` class to render text. This means that you can use the `font` attribute to customize the font used by your text widgets.

**Configurations and Optimizations**
--------------------------------------

To get the most out of the `styled_widget` package, there are some configurations and optimizations you can make:

*   Use the `Styled.widget` widget to wrap your widgets, rather than using the `style` attribute directly. This will allow you to take advantage of the package's caching and optimization features.
*   Use the `TextStyle` class to define your text styles, rather than using the `style` attribute directly. This will allow you to take advantage of the package's text styling features.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:styled_widget/styled_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Styled Widget Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a Styled.widget to wrap our widgets
    return Styled.widget(
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Styled Widget Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Use the Styled.widget to style our text
              Styled.widget(
                child: Text('Hello, World!'),
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Use the TextStyle class to define our text style
              Text(
                'This is a styled text',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18, color: Colors.red),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
      // Use the style attribute to customize the appearance of our widgets
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and the MyApp widget is created.
// 2. The MyApp widget builds the MaterialApp and sets the theme.
// 3. The MaterialApp builds the MyHomePage widget.
// 4. The MyHomePage widget builds the Scaffold and sets the appBar and body.
// 5. The Scaffold builds the Styled.widget and sets the child and style.
// 6. The Styled.widget builds the Text and sets the style.
// 7. The Text is displayed on the screen with the customized appearance.

// In summary, the Styled.widget package allows us to customize the appearance of our widgets by wrapping them in a Styled.widget and using the style attribute. We can also use the TextStyle class to define our text styles and take advantage of the package's caching and optimization features.
