# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Equations Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Equations package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  equations: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires internet access for fetching data or resources.

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the Equations package:

```dart
import 'package:equations/equations.dart';
```

## Step 5: Basic Usage

You can now start using the Equations package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to parse and evaluate an equation:

```dart
void main() {
  var equation = Equation.parse("2x + 3 = 7");
  var solution = equation.solve();
  print("Solution: $solution");
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to parse an equation and find its solution.

# Complete Example of Using the Equations Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:equations/equations.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Equations Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: EquationHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class EquationHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EquationHomePageState createState() => _EquationHomePageState();
}

class _EquationHomePageState extends State<EquationHomePage> {
  String _equationInput = "2x + 3 = 7"; // Default equation
  String _solution = ""; // To store the solution

  // Function to solve the equation
  void _solveEquation() {
    try {
      // Parse the equation from the input string
      var equation = Equation.parse(_equationInput);
      // Solve the equation
      var solution = equation.solve();
      // Update the solution state
      setState(() {
        _solution = "Solution: $solution";
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors during parsing or solving
      setState(() {
        _solution = "Error: ${e.toString()}";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Equations Solver'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            TextField(
              // Input field for the equation
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter Equation',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
              onChanged: (value) {
                _equationInput = value; // Update input value
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _solveEquation, // Button to solve the equation
              child: Text('Solve Equation'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              _solution, // Display the solution
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code is a complete Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the Equations package.
// 
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app and sets `RealFlutter` as the home widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` class builds the main MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The `EquationHomePage` widget is a stateful widget that manages the equation input and solution display.
// 4. The `_solveEquation` method parses the input equation and attempts to solve it, updating the UI with the result.
// 5. The UI consists of a TextField for input, a button to trigger the solving process, and a Text widget to display the solution.
// 
// This application allows users to input any equation in the form of a string, and upon pressing the button, it will display the solution or an error message if the equation is invalid.
```
