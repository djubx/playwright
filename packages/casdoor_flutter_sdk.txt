   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add internet permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Basic Usage
To use the **casdoor_flutter_sdk**, you need to initialize it with your Casdoor server details. Hereâ€™s how you can do that:

```dart
import 'package:casdoor_flutter_sdk/casdoor_flutter_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the Casdoor SDK with your server details
  Casdoor.initialize(
    serverUrl: 'https://your-casdoor-server.com',
    clientId: 'your-client-id',
    appName: 'your-app-name',
  );
}
```

After initialization, you can use the SDK to manage user authentication, such as logging in and registering users.

# Complete Example of Using Casdoor Flutter SDK

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:casdoor_flutter_sdk/casdoor_flutter_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the Casdoor SDK with your server details
  Casdoor.initialize(
    serverUrl: 'https://your-casdoor-server.com',
    clientId: 'your-client-id',
    appName: 'your-app-name',
  );
  
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Casdoor Flutter SDK Example',
      home: LoginPage(),
    );
  }
}

class LoginPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LoginPageState createState() => _LoginPageState();
}

class _LoginPageState extends State<LoginPage> {
  final TextEditingController _usernameController = TextEditingController();
  final TextEditingController _passwordController = TextEditingController();

  // Function to handle user login
  void _login() async {
    // Call the login method from the Casdoor SDK
    final result = await Casdoor.login(
      username: _usernameController.text,
      password: _passwordController.text,
    );

    // Check if login was successful
    if (result != null) {
      // Navigate to the home page if login is successful
      Navigator.pushReplacement(
        context,
        MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => HomePage()),
      );
    } else {
      // Show an error message if login failed
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Login failed')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Login')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _usernameController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Username'),
            ),
            TextField(
              controller: _passwordController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Password'),
              obscureText: true,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _login,
              child: Text('Login'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Home Page!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing the Casdoor SDK with server details.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which sets the LoginPage as the home screen.
// 3. In the LoginPage, users can enter their username and password.
// 4. When the login button is pressed, the _login function is called.
// 5. The _login function uses the Casdoor SDK to authenticate the user.
// 6. If the login is successful, the user is navigated to the HomePage.
// 7. If the login fails, an error message is displayed using a SnackBar.
