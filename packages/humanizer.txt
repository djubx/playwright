Here's a detailed technical blog on the "humanizer" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Humanizer Flutter Package

The **Humanizer** package for Flutter is a powerful tool designed to convert data into a more human-readable format. This package is particularly useful when you want to present data in a way that is easily understandable by users, such as formatting dates, numbers, and other types of data. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the Humanizer package in scenarios such as:
- Displaying time in a user-friendly format (e.g., "5 minutes ago" instead of a timestamp).
- Formatting numbers with appropriate suffixes (e.g., "1K" for 1,000).
- Converting complex data types into simpler, more digestible formats.

## Features
- **Date and Time Formatting**: Convert timestamps into relative time formats.
- **Number Formatting**: Easily format large numbers into human-readable strings.
- **Pluralization**: Automatically handle plural forms of words based on counts.
- **Customizable**: Offers options to customize the output format according to your needs.

The Humanizer package is a great addition to any Flutter application that requires user-friendly data presentation.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Humanizer Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the Humanizer package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  humanizer: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart files, import the Humanizer package:

```dart
import 'package:humanizer/humanizer.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package
You can now use the Humanizer package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to format a date and a number:

```dart
void main() {
  // Example of formatting a date
  String humanizedDate = Humanizer.humanizeDate(DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(minutes: 5)));
  print(humanizedDate); // Output: "5 minutes ago"

  // Example of formatting a number
  String humanizedNumber = Humanizer.humanizeNumber(1500);
  print(humanizedNumber); // Output: "1.5K"
}
```

This setup allows you to easily convert data into a more user-friendly format, enhancing the overall user experience of your application.

# Complete Example of Using the Humanizer Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:humanizer/humanizer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp is the main widget of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Humanizer Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// HomePage is the main screen of the application
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Humanizer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a humanized date
            Text(
              'Time since: ${Humanizer.humanizeDate(DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(hours: 2)))}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Displaying a humanized number
            Text(
              'Formatted number: ${Humanizer.humanizeNumber(2500)}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Displaying pluralization
            Text(
              'You have ${Humanizer.pluralize('apple', 5)}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is the main screen.
// 4. HomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 5. The Column displays three Text widgets:
//    - The first shows the time since a specific date in a human-readable format.
//    - The second shows a formatted number in a human-readable format.
//    - The third demonstrates pluralization based on a count.
// 6. The app is structured to provide a clear and user-friendly display of data.
```
