# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_octicons

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_octicons` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_octicons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_octicons/flutter_octicons.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Octicons in Your Application

You can now use Octicons in your Flutter widgets. Here’s how to use an Octicon in a simple Flutter app:

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 5: Customizing Icons

You can customize the size and color of the icons as follows:

```dart
Icon(Octicons.heart, size: 30.0, color: Colors.red);
```

This example shows how to change the `heart` icon's size and color.

# Complete Example of flutter_octicons

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_octicons/flutter_octicons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Octicons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Octicons Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a star icon
              Icon(Octicons.star, size: 50.0, color: Colors.yellow),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a heart icon
              Icon(Octicons.heart, size: 50.0, color: Colors.red),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a home icon
              Icon(Octicons.home, size: 50.0, color: Colors.blue),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Flutter Octicons Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, three Octicons are displayed: star, heart, and home.
// 6. Each icon is given a size and color, and SizedBox widgets are used to add space between them.
// 7. The app showcases how to use Octicons effectively in a Flutter application.
```
