## Basic Usage
To use the **awesome_rating** package, you can create a simple rating widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:awesome_rating/awesome_rating.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Awesome Rating Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: RatingWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RatingWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RatingWidgetState createState() => _RatingWidgetState();
}

class _RatingWidgetState extends State<RatingWidget> {
  double _rating = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        AwesomeRating(
          rating: _rating,
          onRatingChanged: (rating) {
            setState(() {
              _rating = rating; // Update the rating state
            });
          },
          starCount: 5, // Number of stars
          starSize: 40, // Size of each star
          color: Colors.amber, // Color of the stars
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        Text('Rating: $_rating'), // Display the current rating
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application with a rating widget that allows users to select a rating from 0 to 5 stars.

# Complete Example of Awesome Rating

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:awesome_rating/awesome_rating.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Awesome Rating Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: RatingWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RatingWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RatingWidgetState createState() => _RatingWidgetState();
}

class _RatingWidgetState extends State<RatingWidget> {
  double _rating = 0; // Initialize the rating variable

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        AwesomeRating(
          rating: _rating, // Current rating value
          onRatingChanged: (rating) {
            setState(() {
              _rating = rating; // Update the rating state when user interacts
            });
          },
          starCount: 5, // Total number of stars available for rating
          starSize: 40, // Size of each star icon
          color: Colors.amber, // Color of the stars
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between the rating and text
        Text('Rating: $_rating'), // Display the current rating value
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered RatingWidget.
// 3. The RatingWidget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current rating state.
// 4. When the user taps on the stars in the AwesomeRating widget, the onRatingChanged callback is triggered.
// 5. The rating state is updated using setState, which causes the widget to rebuild and display the new rating.
// 6. The current rating is displayed below the rating stars, providing immediate feedback to the user.
