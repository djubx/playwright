2. Create a widget that utilizes the swiper:

   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cool Card Swiper')),
         body: CoolCardSwiper(
           items: [
             CardItem(title: 'Card 1', description: 'Description 1'),
             CardItem(title: 'Card 2', description: 'Description 2'),
             CardItem(title: 'Card 3', description: 'Description 3'),
           ],
         ),

# Complete Example of flutter_cool_card_swiper

Here is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `flutter_cool_card_swiper` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_cool_card_swiper/flutter_cool_card_swiper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cool Card Swiper Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cool Card Swiper')),
      body: CoolCardSwiper(
        items: [
          CardItem(title: 'Card 1', description: 'Description 1'),
          CardItem(title: 'Card 2', description: 'Description 2'),
          CardItem(title: 'Card 3', description: 'Description 3'),
        ],
        onSwipe: (index) {
          // This callback is triggered when a card is swiped
          print('Swiped card index: $index');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a CoolCardSwiper in the body.
// 4. The CoolCardSwiper takes a list of CardItem objects to display.
// 5. The onSwipe callback is defined to print the index of the swiped card to the console.
// 6. Users can swipe through the cards, and the app responds to their actions.
