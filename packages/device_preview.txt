# Device Preview Flutter Package

The **device_preview** package for Flutter is a powerful tool that allows developers to preview their applications on various device configurations directly within the development environment. This package is particularly useful for ensuring that your app looks and behaves as expected across different screen sizes, orientations, and platforms.

## When to Use

You should consider using the **device_preview** package when:
- You want to test your Flutter app on multiple devices without needing physical devices.
- You need to ensure that your UI is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes and resolutions.
- You want to simulate different device features, such as notches, screen sizes, and orientations.

## Features

- **Device Simulation**: Preview your app on a wide range of devices, including phones, tablets, and more.
- **Orientation Control**: Easily switch between portrait and landscape modes.
- **Custom Device Configurations**: Create and use custom device configurations to match specific requirements.
- **Hot Reload Support**: Enjoy the benefits of Flutter's hot reload feature while using the device preview.

By integrating this package into your development workflow, you can significantly enhance your app's design and usability across various devices.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Device Preview

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **device_preview** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **device_preview** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  device_preview: ^0.8.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Configuring for Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file allows for the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

## Step 3: Configuring for iOS

For iOS, you may need to adjust your `Info.plist` file to allow for device previews. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>UIRequiresPersistentWiFi</key>
<true/>
```

## Step 4: Using Device Preview in Your App

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Wrap your `MaterialApp` with `DevicePreview` in your `main.dart` file. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:device_preview/device_preview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    DevicePreview(
      enabled: !kReleaseMode, // Enable device preview only in debug mode
      builder: (context) => RealFlutterApp(), // Your app widget
    ),
  );
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Device Preview Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: HomeScreen(),
      builder: DevicePreview.appBuilder, // Add this line
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Device Preview Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Hello, Device Preview!')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `DevicePreview` widget wraps the main application, allowing you to preview it on different devices.

# Complete Example of Device Preview

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:device_preview/device_preview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    DevicePreview(
      enabled: !kReleaseMode, // Enable device preview only in debug mode
      builder: (context) => RealFlutterApp(), // Your app widget
    ),
  );
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Device Preview Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: HomeScreen(),
      builder: DevicePreview.appBuilder, // Integrate Device Preview
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Device Preview Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Hello, Device Preview!')),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app and wraps it in the DevicePreview widget.
// 2. DevicePreview is enabled only in debug mode to avoid unnecessary overhead in release builds.
// 3. The RealFlutterApp widget is defined, which contains the MaterialApp.
// 4. The MaterialApp is configured with a title, theme, and home screen.
// 5. The HomeScreen widget is a simple scaffold with an AppBar and centered text.
// 6. The builder property of MaterialApp is set to DevicePreview.appBuilder to enable device preview features.
