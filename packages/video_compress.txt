# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Video Compress Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `video_compress` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_compress: ^3.1.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31  // or the latest version
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.3'  // Required for multidex support
}
```

2. In `AndroidManifest.xml`, add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select videos.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to record videos.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to record audio.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to compress a video.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_compress/video_compress.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String? _compressedVideoPath;

  Future<void> _compressVideo(String videoPath) async {
    // Start the video compression process
    final MediaInfo? info = await VideoCompress.compressVideo(
      videoPath,
      quality: VideoQuality.MediumQuality, // Set the desired quality
      deleteOrigin: false, // Keep the original video
    );

    // Check if the compression was successful
    if (info != null) {
      setState(() {
        _compressedVideoPath = info.path; // Store the path of the compressed video
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Video Compress Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            if (_compressedVideoPath != null)
              Text('Compressed Video Path: $_compressedVideoPath'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Call the video compression function with a sample video path
                await _compressVideo('path/to/your/video.mp4');
              },
              child: Text('Compress Video'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Importing Packages**: The necessary packages are imported at the beginning.
- **Stateful Widget**: `RealFlutter` is a stateful widget that manages the state of the video compression process.
- **_compressVideo Method**: This method handles the video compression logic. It uses the `VideoCompress.compressVideo` method to compress the video and updates the state with the path of the compressed video.
- **UI Elements**: The UI consists of a button to trigger the compression and a text widget to display the path of the compressed video.

This setup provides a basic framework for using the `video_compress` package in a Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Video Compression in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_compress/video_compress.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String? _compressedVideoPath; // Variable to hold the path of the compressed video

  Future<void> _compressVideo(String videoPath) async {
    // Start the video compression process
    final MediaInfo? info = await VideoCompress.compressVideo(
      videoPath,
      quality: VideoQuality.MediumQuality, // Set the desired quality
      deleteOrigin: false, // Keep the original video
    );

    // Check if the compression was successful
    if (info != null) {
      setState(() {
        _compressedVideoPath = info.path; // Store the path of the compressed video
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Video Compress Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            if (_compressedVideoPath != null)
              Text('Compressed Video Path: $_compressedVideoPath'), // Display the compressed video path
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Call the video compression function with a sample video path
                await _compressVideo('path/to/your/video.mp4');
              },
              child: Text('Compress Video'), // Button to trigger video compression
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a stateful widget.
// 2. When the user presses the "Compress Video" button, the _compressVideo method is called.
// 3. The _compressVideo method uses the VideoCompress.compressVideo method to compress the video at the specified path.
// 4. If the compression is successful, the path of the compressed video is stored in the _compressedVideoPath variable.
// 5. The UI updates to display the path of the compressed video, allowing the user to see the result of the compression.
```
