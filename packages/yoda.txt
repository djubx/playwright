# Setting Up and Using Yoda
==========================

### Step 1: Add Yoda to Your Flutter Project

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  yoda: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import Yoda in Your Dart File

Add the following line to the top of your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:yoda/yoda.dart';
```
### Step 3: Use Yoda Widgets in Your App

Here's an example of using the `YodaLayout` widget:
```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return YodaLayout(
      children: [
        YodaText('Hello, World!'),
        YodaButton('Click me!'),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* For Android, make sure to add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<application
  ...
  android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
  ...
>
```
* For iOS, make sure to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>
<false/>
```
### Optimizations

* To improve performance, make sure to use the `YodaCache` widget to cache frequently used widgets.
* To improve accessibility, make sure to use the `YodaAccessibility` widget to provide accessibility features for your app.

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a YodaLayout widget to hold our content
    return YodaLayout(
      // Add a YodaText widget to display some text
      children: [
        YodaText('Hello, World!'),
        
        // Add a YodaButton widget to display a button
        YodaButton('Click me!'),
        
        // Add a YodaCache widget to cache frequently used widgets
        YodaCache(
          child: YodaText('Cached text'),
        ),
        
        // Add a YodaAccessibility widget to provide accessibility features
        YodaAccessibility(
          child: YodaText('Accessible text'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by running the main function, which creates a RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a YodaLayout widget, which holds our content.
// The YodaLayout widget contains several child widgets, including YodaText, YodaButton, YodaCache, and YodaAccessibility.
// Each child widget is used to display different types of content, such as text, buttons, cached widgets, and accessible widgets.
// The YodaCache widget is used to cache frequently used widgets, which can improve performance.
// The YodaAccessibility widget is used to provide accessibility features for our app.
