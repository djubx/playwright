Here's a detailed technical blog on the "gazelle_core" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Gazelle Core Flutter Package

The **gazelle_core** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to streamline the development of Flutter applications by providing a set of core functionalities that enhance performance and usability. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to implement features such as state management, networking, and data persistence in a more efficient manner.

## When to Use Gazelle Core

You should consider using the **gazelle_core** package when:
- You need a robust state management solution that integrates seamlessly with Flutter's reactive framework.
- Your application requires efficient networking capabilities, including RESTful API interactions.
- You want to implement data persistence with minimal boilerplate code.

## Key Features
- **State Management**: Simplifies the management of application state with a reactive approach.
- **Networking**: Provides utilities for making HTTP requests and handling responses.
- **Data Persistence**: Offers easy-to-use methods for storing and retrieving data locally.

By leveraging these features, developers can create more maintainable and scalable applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Gazelle Core

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **gazelle_core** package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **gazelle_core** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gazelle_core: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions for internet access:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using Gazelle Core

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in a Flutter application.

1. **Import the Package**:
   In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:gazelle_core/gazelle_core.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize the Core**:
   You can initialize the core functionalities in your main application file:

   ```dart
   void main() {
     GazelleCore.initialize();
     runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```

3. **Using State Management**:
   You can create a stateful widget that utilizes the state management features of the package:

   ```dart
   class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
   }

   class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
     // Define your state variables and methods here
   }
   ```

4. **Making Network Requests**:
   Use the networking utilities to fetch data from an API:

   ```dart
   void fetchData() async {
     final response = await GazelleCore.network.get('https://api.example.com/data');
     // Handle the response
   }
   ```

5. **Data Persistence**:
   Store and retrieve data using the persistence features:

   ```dart
   void saveData(String key, String value) {
     GazelleCore.storage.save(key, value);
   }

   String loadData(String key) {
     return GazelleCore.storage.load(key);
   }
   ```

With these steps, you can effectively set up and utilize the **gazelle_core** package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example: A Flutter Application Using Gazelle Core

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gazelle_core/gazelle_core.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the Gazelle Core package
  GazelleCore.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gazelle Core Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  String _data = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch data when the widget is initialized
    fetchData();
  }

  // Function to fetch data from an API
  void fetchData() async {
    final response = await GazelleCore.network.get('https://api.example.com/data');
    // Update the state with the fetched data
    setState(() {
      _data = response.data; // Assuming response.data contains the desired data
    });
  }

  // Function to save data locally
  void saveData() {
    GazelleCore.storage.save('myKey', _data);
  }

  // Function to load data locally
  String loadData() {
    return GazelleCore.storage.load('myKey');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Gazelle Core Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Fetched Data: $_data'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                saveData(); // Save the fetched data
              },
              child: Text('Save Data'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                String loadedData = loadData(); // Load the saved data
                print('Loaded Data: $loadedData');
              },
              child: Text('Load Data'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Gazelle Core package and runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, setting MyHomePage as the home widget.
// 3. MyHomePage is a stateful widget that fetches data from an API when initialized.
// 4. The fetchData function makes a network request to retrieve data and updates the state.
// 5. The UI displays the fetched data and provides buttons to save and load data locally.
// 6. The saveData function saves the fetched data using Gazelle Core's storage utility.
// 7. The loadData function retrieves the saved data and prints it to the console.
```
