# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Marquee Vertical Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the `marquee_vertical` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  marquee_vertical: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `MarqueeVertical` widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:marquee_vertical/marquee_vertical.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Marquee Vertical Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: MarqueeVertical(
            text: 'Welcome to the Marquee Vertical Package!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.blue),
            scrollDuration: Duration(seconds: 5),
            pauseDuration: Duration(seconds: 2),
            startPadding: 20.0,
            blankSpace: 50.0,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **MarqueeVertical Widget**: This is the main widget that creates the vertical scrolling effect.
- **text**: The text to be displayed.
- **style**: The style of the text, including size and color.
- **scrollDuration**: The duration for the text to scroll completely.
- **pauseDuration**: The duration for which the scrolling pauses before restarting.
- **startPadding**: Padding at the start of the text.
- **blankSpace**: Space after the text before it starts scrolling again.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `marquee_vertical` package into your Flutter application.

    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, the MarqueeVertical widget is instantiated with the desired text and styling.
4. The MarqueeVertical widget handles the scrolling of the text, with specified durations for scrolling and pausing.
5. The text scrolls vertically, creating an engaging user experience.
