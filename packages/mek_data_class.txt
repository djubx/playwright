Here's a detailed technical blog on the "mek_data_class" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Overview of the mek_data_class Flutter Package

The `mek_data_class` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the management of data classes in Flutter applications. It provides a structured way to define data models, making it easier to handle serialization and deserialization of JSON data. This package is particularly useful when working with APIs, as it allows developers to create robust data models that can easily convert between JSON and Dart objects.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `mek_data_class` package in scenarios such as:

- **API Integration**: When your Flutter app needs to communicate with RESTful APIs, this package can help you manage the data models efficiently.
- **Data Persistence**: If your application requires storing and retrieving data from local storage or databases, the package can streamline the process.
- **Complex Data Structures**: For applications that involve nested data structures, the package simplifies the creation and management of these models.

## Key Features

- **Automatic JSON Serialization**: The package automatically generates code for converting between JSON and Dart objects, reducing boilerplate code.
- **Type Safety**: It ensures type safety by generating classes with strong typing, minimizing runtime errors.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the generated code to fit your specific needs, allowing for flexibility in your data models.

Overall, the `mek_data_class` package enhances productivity and code quality in Flutter applications by providing a structured approach to data management.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using mek_data_class

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `mek_data_class` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `mek_data_class` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mek_data_class: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Creating Data Classes

Next, you need to create your data classes. For example, let's create a simple `User` class. Create a new Dart file named `user.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:mek_data_class/mek_data_class.dart';

part 'user.g.dart'; // This will be generated

@MekDataClass()
class User {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final String email;

  User({required this.id, required this.name, required this.email});
}
```

## Step 3: Generating Code

To generate the necessary code for JSON serialization, run the following command:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This command will create a `user.g.dart` file containing the serialization logic.

## Step 4: Using the Data Class

Now that we have our `User` class set up, we can use it in our application. Hereâ€™s how you can create a `User` object and convert it to JSON:

```dart
void main() {
  User user = User(id: '1', name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com');
  
  // Convert User object to JSON
  Map<String, dynamic> userJson = user.toJson();
  print(userJson); // Output: {id: 1, name: John Doe, email: john@example.com}

  // Convert JSON back to User object
  User newUser = User.fromJson(userJson);
  print(newUser.name); // Output: John Doe
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to enable Swift support in your project settings if you are using any Swift code alongside your Flutter app.

## Conclusion

You have now set up the `mek_data_class` package in your Flutter application and learned how to create and use data classes effectively. This package simplifies the process of managing data models, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.

# Complete Example of Using mek_data_class

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mek_data_class/mek_data_class.dart';

// Import the generated user class
import 'user.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'mek_data_class Example',
      home: UserScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class UserScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a User object
    User user = User(id: '1', name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com');

    // Convert User object to JSON
    Map<String, dynamic> userJson = user.toJson();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('User Information'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('User ID: ${user.id}'),
            Text('User Name: ${user.name}'),
            Text('User Email: ${user.email}'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('User JSON: ${userJson.toString()}'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets UserScreen as the home widget.
// 3. UserScreen creates a User object with sample data.
// 4. The User object is converted to JSON format using the toJson() method.
// 5. The UI displays the user's ID, name, email, and the JSON representation of the User object.
```
