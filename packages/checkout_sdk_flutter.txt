# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using checkout_sdk_flutter

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `checkout_sdk_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the `checkout_sdk_flutter` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  checkout_sdk_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/checkout_sdk_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Using the Package

Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initiate a payment process.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:checkout_sdk_flutter/checkout_sdk_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Checkout SDK Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Checkout SDK Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Initialize the checkout process
              initiateCheckout();
            },
            child: Text('Start Checkout'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void initiateCheckout() {
    // Create a checkout request
    final checkoutRequest = CheckoutRequest(
      amount: 100.0, // Amount to be charged
      currency: 'USD', // Currency code
      // Additional parameters can be added here
    );

    // Call the checkout method
    CheckoutSDK.startCheckout(checkoutRequest).then((result) {
      // Handle the result of the checkout process
      if (result.isSuccess) {
        print('Payment successful: ${result.transactionId}');
      } else {
        print('Payment failed: ${result.errorMessage}');
      }
    });
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that initiates the checkout process when pressed. The `initiateCheckout` method constructs a `CheckoutRequest` and calls the `startCheckout` method from the `CheckoutSDK`.

# Complete Example of checkout_sdk_flutter

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `checkout_sdk_flutter` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:checkout_sdk_flutter/checkout_sdk_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Checkout SDK Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Checkout SDK Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Start the checkout process when the button is pressed
              initiateCheckout();
            },
            child: Text('Start Checkout'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void initiateCheckout() {
    // Create a checkout request with the amount and currency
    final checkoutRequest = CheckoutRequest(
      amount: 100.0, // Amount to be charged
      currency: 'USD', // Currency code
      // Additional parameters can be added here
    );

    // Call the checkout method and handle the result
    CheckoutSDK.startCheckout(checkoutRequest).then((result) {
      // Check if the payment was successful
      if (result.isSuccess) {
        // Print the transaction ID if successful
        print('Payment successful: ${result.transactionId}');
      } else {
        // Print the error message if failed
        print('Payment failed: ${result.errorMessage}');
      }
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the initiateCheckout method is called.
// 4. Inside initiateCheckout, a CheckoutRequest is created with the amount and currency.
// 5. The startCheckout method is called with the checkout request.
// 6. The result of the checkout process is handled in a callback.
// 7. If the payment is successful, the transaction ID is printed; otherwise, the error message is displayed.
```
