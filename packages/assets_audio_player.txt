- Support for multiple audio formats (e.g., MP3, WAV, AAC)
- Control audio playback (play, pause, stop, seek)
- Get current playback position and duration
- Set volume and playback speed

# Setting Up the Package
To use the `assets_audio_player` package, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  assets_audio_player: ^3.0.3
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:assets_audio_player/assets_audio_player.dart';
```

## Platform-Specific Details
- **Android:** No additional configuration is required.
- **iOS:** You need to add the following lines to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```
This allows the app to play audio files from assets.

## Using the Package
To play an audio file, create an instance of the `AssetsAudioPlayer` class and call the `play` method:
```dart
AssetsAudioPlayer _audioPlayer = AssetsAudioPlayer();

_audioPlayer.open(
  Audio("assets/audio_file.mp3"),
  autoStart: true,
);
```
You can control audio playback using the `play`, `pause`, `stop`, and `seek` methods.

  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The user presses the 'Play' button, which calls the `_audioPlayer.open` method to play the audio file.
// 2. The audio file starts playing, and the `_isPlaying` flag is set to `true`.
// 3. The user presses the 'Pause' button, which calls the `_audioPlayer.pause` method to pause audio playback.
// 4. The audio playback is paused, and the `_isPlaying` flag is set to `false`.
// 5. The user presses the 'Stop' button, which calls the `_audioPlayer.stop` method to stop audio playback.
// 6. The audio playback is stopped, and the `_isPlaying` flag is set to `false`.
