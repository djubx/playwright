# Description

The `widget_marker_google_map` Flutter package is a powerful tool for integrating Google Maps into your Flutter applications. It allows developers to easily add markers to a Google Map, providing a visual representation of locations and points of interest. This package is particularly useful for applications that require location-based services, such as travel apps, delivery services, or any app that needs to display geographical data.

## Features
- **Customizable Markers**: You can create markers with custom icons, colors, and sizes.
- **Interactive Maps**: Users can interact with the map, zooming in and out, and tapping on markers for more information.
- **Platform Support**: Fully supports both Android and iOS platforms, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process and straightforward API for adding markers and handling map events.

## When to Use
- When you need to display geographical data in your app.
- If your application requires user interaction with map markers.
- For applications that need to show multiple locations on a map, such as restaurants, hotels, or service points.

# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `widget_marker_google_map` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  widget_marker_google_map: ^latest_version
```

Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

### Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, you need to ensure that you have the necessary permissions and API key set up.

1. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

3. Add your Google Maps API key inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
    android:value="YOUR_API_KEY"/>
```

### Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, you also need to set up permissions and the API key.

1. Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/`.
2. Add the following keys for location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
```

3. Ensure you have your Google Maps API key set up in your project.

### Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:widget_marker_google_map/widget_marker_google_map.dart';
```

### Step 5: Initialize the Map

You can now initialize the map in your Flutter application. 

```dart
// Example of initializing the map will be shown in the next section.
```

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_marker_google_map/widget_marker_google_map.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Google Map Example',
      home: MapScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class MapScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MapScreenState createState() => _MapScreenState();
}

class _MapScreenState extends State<MapScreen> {
  // Initialize the Google Map controller
  GoogleMapController? mapController;

  // Sample markers to display on the map
  final List<Marker> markers = [
    Marker(
      markerId: MarkerId('marker1'),
      position: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194), // San Francisco
      infoWindow: InfoWindow(title: 'San Francisco'),
    ),
    Marker(
      markerId: MarkerId('marker2'),
      position: LatLng(34.0522, -118.2437), // Los Angeles
      infoWindow: InfoWindow(title: 'Los Angeles'),
    ),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Google Map with Markers'),
      ),
      body: GoogleMap(
        onMapCreated: (GoogleMapController controller) {
          mapController = controller; // Assign the controller
        },
        initialCameraPosition: CameraPosition(
          target: LatLng(36.7783, -119.4179), // California
          zoom: 6,
        ),
        markers: Set.from(markers), // Set the markers on the map
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The home of the app is the MapScreen, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In the MapScreen, we define a list of markers with their positions and info windows.
// 5. The GoogleMap widget is created, and we set the initial camera position.
// 6. When the map is created, we assign the controller to manage the map.
// 7. Finally, we display the markers on the map using the Set.from() method.
```
