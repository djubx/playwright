# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `epson_epos` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `epson_epos` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `epson_epos` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  epson_epos: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following keys to request Bluetooth permissions:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to printers.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to printers.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to connect to a printer and print a receipt.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:epson_epos/epson_epos.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Declare a printer object
  late Printer printer;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the printer
    printer = Printer();
  }

  // Function to connect to the printer
  Future<void> connectToPrinter() async {
    try {
      // Connect to the printer
      await printer.connect('Printer_IP_Address');
      print('Connected to printer');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error connecting to printer: $e');
    }
  }

  // Function to print a receipt
  Future<void> printReceipt() async {
    try {
      // Start printing
      await printer.printText('Hello, World!', styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center));
      await printer.printText('Thank you for your purchase!', styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center));
      await printer.cut();
      print('Receipt printed');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error printing receipt: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Epson ePOS Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: connectToPrinter,
              child: Text('Connect to Printer'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: printReceipt,
              child: Text('Print Receipt'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using the `epson_epos` Package

Below is a complete Flutter application that demonstrates how to use the `epson_epos` package to connect to a printer and print a receipt.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:epson_epos/epson_epos.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Declare a printer object
  late Printer printer;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the printer
    printer = Printer();
  }

  // Function to connect to the printer
  Future<void> connectToPrinter() async {
    try {
      // Connect to the printer using its IP address
      await printer.connect('Printer_IP_Address');
      print('Connected to printer');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error connecting to printer: $e');
    }
  }

  // Function to print a receipt
  Future<void> printReceipt() async {
    try {
      // Start printing text to the printer
      await printer.printText('Hello, World!', styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center));
      await printer.printText('Thank you for your purchase!', styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center));
      await printer.cut(); // Cut the paper after printing
      print('Receipt printed');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error printing receipt: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Epson ePOS Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: connectToPrinter, // Connect to the printer when pressed
              child: Text('Connect to Printer'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: printReceipt, // Print receipt when pressed
              child: Text('Print Receipt'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(), // Run the RealFlutter widget
  ));
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts by initializing the `RealFlutter` widget.
// In the `initState` method, we create an instance of the `Printer` class.
// The user can connect to the printer by pressing the "Connect to Printer" button.
// This triggers the `connectToPrinter` method, which attempts to connect to the specified printer IP address.
// If successful, a message is printed to the console.
// The user can then print a receipt by pressing the "Print Receipt" button.
// This calls the `printReceipt` method, which sends text to the printer and cuts the paper after printing.
// The application provides a simple interface for connecting to a printer and printing a receipt.
