# Alerter Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Alerter package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  alerter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if you plan to use notifications or alerts that require user permissions.

## Basic Usage
To use the Alerter package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:alerter/alerter.dart';
```

You can then create and display alerts using the `Alerter` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to show a success alert:

```dart
Alerter.showAlert(
  context: context,
  title: "Success",
  message: "Your action was successful!",
  alertType: AlertType.success,
);
```

This will display a success alert with the specified title and message. You can customize the alert further by adjusting its properties.

# Alerter Flutter Package: Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alerter/alerter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Alerter Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Alerter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a success alert when the button is pressed
            Alerter.showAlert(
              context: context,
              title: "Success",
              message: "Your action was successful!",
              alertType: AlertType.success,
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Success Alert'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen is a StatelessWidget that contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the Alerter.showAlert method is called to display a success alert.
