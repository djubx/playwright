# Setup and Usage Tutorial for flutter_map_directions

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_map_directions`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file along with `flutter_map`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_map: ^0.14.0
  flutter_map_directions: ^0.1.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the packages.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

2. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21.

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys for location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show directions.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show directions.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `flutter_map_directions` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map/flutter_map.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map_directions/flutter_map_directions.dart';
```

2. Create a simple map with directions:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Map Directions Example')),
        body: FlutterMap(
          options: MapOptions(
            center: LatLng(51.5, -0.09), // Center of the map
            zoom: 13.0,
          ),
          layers: [
            TileLayerOptions(
              urlTemplate: "https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
              subdomains: ['a', 'b', 'c'],
            ),
            DirectionsLayerOptions(
              waypoints: [
                Waypoint(latLng: LatLng(51.5, -0.09)), // Start point
                Waypoint(latLng: LatLng(51.51, -0.1)), // End point
              ],
              color: Colors.blue,
              strokeWidth: 4.0,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that displays a map with a route drawn between two points.

              subdomains: ['a', 'b', 'c'], // Subdomains for tile loading
            ),
            // Directions layer to draw the route
            DirectionsLayerOptions(
              waypoints: [
                Waypoint(latLng: LatLng(51.5, -0.09)), // Start point
                Waypoint(latLng: LatLng(51.51, -0.1)), // End point
              ],
              color: Colors.blue, // Color of the route
              strokeWidth: 4.0, // Width of the route line
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

// The above code sets up a Flutter application that displays a map with a route drawn between two specified locations.
// 
// 1. The `RealFlutter` class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main application.
// 2. Inside the `build` method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body consists of a FlutterMap widget, which is configured with options for centering the map and setting the zoom level.
// 4. Two layers are added to the map: a TileLayer for the map tiles and a DirectionsLayer for drawing the route.
// 5. The waypoints for the route are defined, with the start and end points specified as LatLng coordinates.
// 6. Finally, the `main` function runs the app by calling `runApp` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
