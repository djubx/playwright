# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `otp_text_field_v2` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     otp_text_field_v2: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and ensure you have the necessary permissions for network access if your OTP is being sent via an API.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:otp_text_field_v2/otp_text_field_v2.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `otp_text_field_v2` package in your Flutter application:

1. **Create a Stateful Widget**: This will allow you to manage the state of the OTP input fields.

2. **Implement the OTP Input Fields**: Use the `OTPTextField` widget to create the input fields.

3. **Handle Input**: Implement logic to handle the input and validation of the OTP.

### Example Code Snippet

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:otp_text_field_v2/otp_text_field_v2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Controller to manage the OTP input
  final TextEditingController _otpController = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('OTP Input Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // OTP Text Field
            OTPTextField(
              length: 6, // Length of the OTP
              width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width,
              fieldWidth: 40,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              textFieldAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
              fieldStyle: FieldStyle.box,
              onChanged: (pin) {
                // Handle changes in the OTP input
                print("Entered OTP: $pin");
              },
              onCompleted: (pin) {
                // Handle OTP submission
                print("OTP Submitted: $pin");
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Logic to verify the OTP
                print("Verifying OTP: ${_otpController.text}");
              },
              child: Text('Verify OTP'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:otp_text_field_v2/otp_text_field_v2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Controller to manage the OTP input
  final TextEditingController _otpController = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('OTP Input Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // OTP Text Field
            OTPTextField(
              length: 6, // Length of the OTP
              width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width,
              fieldWidth: 40,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              textFieldAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
              fieldStyle: FieldStyle.box,
              onChanged: (pin) {
                // Handle changes in the OTP input
                print("Entered OTP: $pin");
              },
              onCompleted: (pin) {
                // Handle OTP submission
                print("OTP Submitted: $pin");
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Logic to verify the OTP
                print("Verifying OTP: ${_otpController.text}");
              },
              child: Text('Verify OTP'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. Inside the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains a Column that centers its children vertically.
// 4. An OTPTextField is created with a specified length of 6, allowing users to input their OTP.
// 5. The onChanged callback is triggered whenever the user types in the OTP field, printing the current input.
// 6. The onCompleted callback is triggered when the user has filled all OTP fields, allowing for submission handling.
// 7. An ElevatedButton is provided to verify the OTP, which prints the OTP to the console when pressed.
// 8. The app provides a clean and intuitive interface for users to enter and verify their OTPs.
