# Overview of the app_initializer Flutter Package

The `app_initializer` package is a powerful tool designed to streamline the initialization process of Flutter applications. It provides a structured way to manage asynchronous tasks that need to be completed before the app is fully launched, such as loading configurations, initializing services, or fetching user data. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to ensure that certain operations are completed before the user interacts with the app.

## When to Use `app_initializer`

- **Loading Configuration**: When your app requires configuration data from a remote server or local storage before it can function properly.
- **Service Initialization**: If your app relies on services like analytics, authentication, or database connections that need to be set up before the UI is displayed.
- **User Data Fetching**: When you need to fetch user-specific data that is critical for the initial screen of your app.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous Initialization**: Supports multiple asynchronous tasks to be run in parallel or sequentially.
- **Error Handling**: Provides mechanisms to handle errors during the initialization process gracefully.
- **Custom Callbacks**: Allows developers to define custom actions to be executed after initialization is complete.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily configurable to suit different app requirements.

# Setting Up and Using the app_initializer Package

## Installation

To use the `app_initializer` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  app_initializer: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `app_initializer` package, you will typically create a class that extends `AppInitializer`. This class will define the tasks that need to be completed before your app is launched.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up the initializer:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_initializer/app_initializer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: AppInitializer(
        onInitComplete: () {
          // Navigate to the main screen after initialization
          Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
            MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => MainScreen()),
          );
        },
        tasks: [
          () async {
            // Simulate a network call
            await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
            print("Task 1 completed");
          },
          () async {
            // Simulate another task
            await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
            print("Task 2 completed");
          },
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `AppInitializer` widget takes a list of tasks to run before navigating to the main screen. The `onInitComplete` callback is triggered once all tasks are finished.

# Complete Example of Using app_initializer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_initializer/app_initializer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: AppInitializer(
        onInitComplete: () {
          // Navigate to the main screen after initialization
          Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
            MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => MainScreen()),
          );
        },
        tasks: [
          () async {
            // Simulate a network call
            await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
            print("Task 1 completed");
          },
          () async {
            // Simulate another task
            await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
            print("Task 2 completed");
          },
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MainScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Main Screen")),
      body: Center(child: Text("Welcome to the Main Screen!")),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with an AppInitializer as the home widget.
// 3. The AppInitializer takes a list of asynchronous tasks to run before the app is fully launched.
// 4. Each task simulates a delay to mimic network calls or other initialization processes.
// 5. Once all tasks are completed, the onInitComplete callback is triggered, navigating to the MainScreen.
// 6. The MainScreen displays a welcome message to the user.
```
