# Setting Up and Using the Alarm Package in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `alarm` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Installation

To get started, add the `alarm` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  alarm: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

1. **Permissions**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` includes the necessary permissions for setting alarms:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SET_ALARM"/>
   ```

2. **Background Execution**: Configure your app to allow background execution by adding the following service declaration in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <service android:name="com.example.alarm.AlarmService" />
   ```

### iOS

1. **Permissions**: Open your `Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission for notifications:

   ```xml
   <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
   <array>
     <string>fetch</string>
     <string>remote-notification</string>
   </array>
   ```

2. **Notification Setup**: Ensure that your app is configured to handle notifications by setting up the necessary notification capabilities in Xcode.

## Using the Package

To use the `alarm` package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:alarm/alarm.dart';
```

Initialize the package in your main function:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  Alarm.init();
}
```

<-- MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alarm/alarm.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  Alarm.init(); // Initialize the alarm package
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Alarm Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: AlarmHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class AlarmHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AlarmHomePageState createState() => _AlarmHomePageState();
}

class _AlarmHomePageState extends State<AlarmHomePage> {
  DateTime _alarmTime = DateTime.now().add(Duration(minutes: 1)); // Set default alarm time

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Alarm Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Set an alarm:',
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _setAlarm(),
              child: Text('Set Alarm for 1 Minute Later'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _setAlarm() {
    // Schedule an alarm
    Alarm.set(
      alarmDateTime: _alarmTime,
      onRing: () {
        // This function is called when the alarm rings
        print('Alarm is ringing!');
      },
    );
    print('Alarm set for $_alarmTime');
  }
}
```

// The application starts by initializing the `Alarm` package in the `main` function.
// The `MyApp` widget is the root of the application, setting up the MaterialApp with a home page.
// The `AlarmHomePage` widget is a stateful widget that manages the alarm setting functionality.
// The `_alarmTime` variable is initialized to one minute from the current time.
// The UI consists of a button that, when pressed, sets an alarm for the specified time.
// The `_setAlarm` method schedules the alarm and defines the `onRing` callback to handle the alarm event.
// When the alarm time is reached, the `onRing` callback is triggered, printing a message to the console.
