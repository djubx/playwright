# Normalize Flutter Package
The Normalize Flutter package is a utility package designed to simplify the process of normalizing and scaling UI elements across different screen sizes and devices. It provides a set of APIs and widgets that enable developers to create responsive and adaptable UI layouts with ease.

## When to Use
The Normalize package is particularly useful when:

* You need to create a responsive UI that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
* You want to ensure that your UI elements are consistently sized and spaced across different devices.
* You need to support multiple screen densities and resolutions.

## Features
The Normalize package offers the following key features:

* **Screen normalization**: Normalize screen sizes and densities to a standard reference point.
* **Scaling**: Scale UI elements based on the normalized screen size.
* **Spacing**: Apply consistent spacing between UI elements based on the normalized screen size.

# Setting Up the Normalize Package
To use the Normalize package, follow these steps:

1. Add the Normalize package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  normalize: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the Normalize package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:normalize/normalize.dart';
```
## Platform-Specific Configurations
The Normalize package requires no platform-specific configurations. However, you may need to adjust the normalization settings based on your app's specific requirements.

## Optimizations
To optimize the Normalize package, you can:

* Use the ` Normalize.debug` property to enable debugging mode, which can help you identify normalization issues.
* Use the `Normalize.cache` property to enable caching, which can improve performance.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:normalize/normalize.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Normalize Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Step 1: Normalize the screen size
    Normalize.normalize(context);

    // Step 2: Create a container with a scaled size
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: Container(
          width: Normalize.scale(200), // Scale the width to 200 pixels
          height: Normalize.scale(100), // Scale the height to 100 pixels
          color: Colors.blue,
          child: Text(
            'Scaled Container',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: Normalize.scale(24)), // Scale the font size to 24 pixels
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The app starts and runs the `main` function.
// 2. The `main` function creates a `MaterialApp` instance and sets the `RealFlutter` widget as the home page.
// 3. The `RealFlutter` widget creates a `Scaffold` instance and sets the `body` property to a `Center` widget.
// 4. The `Center` widget contains a `Container` instance with a scaled size.
// 5. The `Container` instance has a blue background color and contains a `Text` widget with a scaled font size.
// 6. The app displays the scaled container and text on the screen.

// Summary:
// The Normalize package simplifies the process of normalizing and scaling UI elements across different screen sizes and devices.
// The `RealFlutter` widget demonstrates how to use the Normalize package to create a responsive and adaptable UI layout.
