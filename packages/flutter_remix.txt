# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_remix`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_remix` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_remix: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the icons, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_remix/flutter_remix.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Icons in Your Application

You can now use the icons provided by the `flutter_remix` package. Here’s how to use an icon in a Flutter widget:

```dart
Icon(FlutterRemix.home_2_line, size: 24.0, color: Colors.blue);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your Android project is set up to use the latest Flutter version. The `flutter_remix` package does not require any additional configuration for Android.
  
- **iOS**: For iOS, make sure your project is using a compatible version of Swift. The package should work out of the box without any additional setup.

## Step 4: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons by changing their size and color. Here’s an example:

```dart
Icon(
  FlutterRemix.settings_2_line,
  size: 30.0, // Custom size
  color: Colors.red, // Custom color
);
```

This customization allows you to fit the icons into your app's design seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_remix`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_remix/flutter_remix.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Remix Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Remix Icons'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a home icon
            Icon(
              FlutterRemix.home_2_line,
              size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a settings icon
            Icon(
              FlutterRemix.settings_2_line,
              size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a user icon
            Icon(
              FlutterRemix.user_3_line,
              size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
              color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of the MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. The HomePage widget builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 6. Each Icon widget uses the FlutterRemix icons, with specified sizes and colors.
// 7. SizedBox widgets are used to add spacing between the icons for better visual separation.
```
