# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_rename_app_plus3

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_rename_app_plus3`, you need to add it to your Flutter project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter pub global activate flutter_rename_app_plus3
```

## Usage
Once installed, you can rename your app by running the following command:

```bash
flutter pub global run flutter_rename_app_plus3:main
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android
- The package will automatically update the `AndroidManifest.xml` file and the `build.gradle` files to reflect the new app name and package name.
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to modify these files.

#### iOS
- The package updates the `Info.plist` file to change the display name of the app.
- Make sure to check the Xcode project settings if you have any custom configurations.

### Configuration
You can specify the new app name and package name by providing arguments in the command line. For example:

```bash
flutter pub global run flutter_rename_app_plus3:main --app_name "NewAppName" --package_name "com.example.newapp"
```

This command will rename your app to "NewAppName" and change the package name to "com.example.newapp".

## Best Practices
- Always back up your project before running the rename command.
- Test your app thoroughly after renaming to ensure that all configurations are correctly applied.
- Use version control to track changes made during the renaming process.

# Complete Example: Using flutter_rename_app_plus3

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'NewAppName', // The new app name set during renaming
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Welcome to NewAppName'), // Displaying the new app name
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'This is the home page of NewAppName!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The title of the app is set to 'NewAppName', which reflects the new name after renaming.
// 4. The theme is defined with a primary color of blue.
// 5. The home property of MaterialApp is set to MyHomePage, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 6. MyHomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered Text widget.
// 7. The AppBar displays the new app name, and the body shows a welcome message.
// 8. This structure allows for easy navigation and further development of the app.
