# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Mesh Gradient Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **mesh_gradient** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mesh_gradient: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a mesh gradient background in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mesh_gradient/mesh_gradient.dart';
```

2. Use the `MeshGradient` widget in your widget tree:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    body: MeshGradient(
      colors: [
        Colors.blue,
        Colors.red,
        Colors.green,
        Colors.yellow,
      ],
      stops: [0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0],
      child: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Hello, Mesh Gradient!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

This code creates a full-screen mesh gradient background with a centered text widget.

# Complete Example of Using Mesh Gradient

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mesh_gradient/mesh_gradient.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Mesh Gradient Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        body: MeshGradient(
          // Define the colors for the gradient
          colors: [
            Colors.blue,    // First color
            Colors.red,     // Second color
            Colors.green,   // Third color
            Colors.yellow,  // Fourth color
          ],
          // Define the stops for the gradient
          stops: [0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0],
          // Child widget to display on top of the gradient
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'Hello, Mesh Gradient!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created to provide a basic app structure.
// 4. The MeshGradient widget is used as the body of the Scaffold, allowing for a gradient background.
// 5. The colors and stops properties define the gradient's appearance.
// 6. A Center widget is used to position the Text widget in the middle of the screen.
// 7. The Text widget displays a message with a white font color, making it stand out against the gradient background.
