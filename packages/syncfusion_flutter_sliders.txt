# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Syncfusion Flutter Sliders

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `syncfusion_flutter_sliders` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `syncfusion_flutter_sliders` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  syncfusion_flutter_sliders: ^20.1.55
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode, and ensure that the project settings are configured to support Swift.

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:syncfusion_flutter_sliders/sliders.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Sliders

You can now use the sliders in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a basic slider.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text('Syncfusion Sliders Example'),
    ),
    body: Center(
      child: SfSlider(
        min: 0.0,
        max: 100.0,
        value: 50.0,
        onChanged: (value) {
          // Handle value change
        },
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

This code creates a simple slider that allows users to select a value between 0 and 100. The `onChanged` callback is triggered whenever the slider value changes, allowing you to handle the new value accordingly.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `syncfusion_flutter_sliders` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Syncfusion Flutter Sliders

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:syncfusion_flutter_sliders/sliders.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Syncfusion Sliders Example',
      home: SliderHome(),
    );
  }
}

class SliderHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SliderHomeState createState() => _SliderHomeState();
}

class _SliderHomeState extends State<SliderHome> {
  // Variable to hold the current value of the slider
  double _sliderValue = 50.0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Syncfusion Sliders Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the current value of the slider
            Text('Current Value: ${_sliderValue.toStringAsFixed(1)}'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Create a slider
            SfSlider(
              min: 0.0,
              max: 100.0,
              value: _sliderValue,
              // Update the slider value on change
              onChanged: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  _sliderValue = value; // Update the state with the new value
                });
              },
              // Add a tooltip to show the current value
              tooltip: SliderTooltip(
                alwaysShow: true,
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter class.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. SliderHome is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the slider value.
// 4. The _SliderHomeState class contains a double variable _sliderValue initialized to 50.0.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 6. The Column displays the current value of the slider and the SfSlider widget.
// 7. The SfSlider is configured with a range from 0 to 100, and its value is bound to _sliderValue.
// 8. When the slider is moved, the onChanged callback updates the _sliderValue and rebuilds the UI to reflect the new value.
