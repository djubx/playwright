# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Ant Design Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **ant_design_flutter** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **ant_design_flutter** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ant_design_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package as follows:

```dart
import 'package:ant_design_flutter/ant_design_flutter.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Ant Design Widgets

You can now start using Ant Design widgets in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use a button and a modal dialog.

```dart
// Example of using Ant Design widgets
```

This concludes the setup and basic usage of the **ant_design_flutter** package. You can explore more widgets and their configurations in the official documentation.

# Complete Example of Ant Design Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ant_design_flutter/ant_design_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ant Design Flutter Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Ant Design Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Ant Design Button
            AntButton(
              type: AntButtonType.primary,
              onPressed: () {
                // Show a modal when the button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (BuildContext context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Ant Design Modal'),
                      content: Text('This is a modal dialog using Ant Design!'),
                      actions: <Widget>[
                        TextButton(
                          child: Text('Close'),
                          onPressed: () {
                            Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the modal
                          },
                        ),
                      ],
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Show Modal'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. HomePage contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, an AntButton is created.
// 6. When the button is pressed, a modal dialog is displayed using showDialog.
// 7. The modal contains a title, content, and a close button that dismisses the dialog when pressed.
```

// Final Summary:
// The application starts with the main function, which initializes the RealFlutter widget. The RealFlutter widget sets up a MaterialApp with a title and theme. The HomePage widget is displayed as the main screen, featuring an Ant Design button. When the button is pressed, a modal dialog appears, showcasing the use of Ant Design components. The dialog can be closed by pressing the "Close" button, which dismisses the modal and returns the user to the main screen.
