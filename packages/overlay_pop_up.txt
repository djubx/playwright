# Tutorial: Using the Overlay Pop Up Package
=============================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To use the `overlay_pop_up` package, you need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  overlay_pop_up: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package using the following line:

```dart
import 'package:overlay_pop_up/overlay_pop_up.dart';
```

### Step 3: Create an Overlay Pop-Up

To create an overlay pop-up, you need to use the `OverlayPopUp` widget. Here is an example:

```dart
OverlayPopUp(
  child: Text('Hello, World!'),
  position: OverlayPopUpPosition.center,
  size: Size(200, 100),
)
```

This will create a pop-up with the text "Hello, World!" at the center of the screen.

### Platform-Specific Details

The `overlay_pop_up` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details to keep in mind:

*   On Android, the pop-up will be displayed on top of the status bar. If you want to display the pop-up below the status bar, you need to set the `position` property to `OverlayPopUpPosition.bottom`.
*   On iOS, the pop-up will be displayed on top of the navigation bar. If you want to display the pop-up below the navigation bar, you need to set the `position` property to `OverlayPopUpPosition.bottom`.

### Required Configurations or Optimizations

There are no required configurations or optimizations for using the `overlay_pop_up` package. However, you may want to consider the following:

*   You can customize the appearance of the pop-up by using the `decoration` property.
*   You can add a background color to the pop-up by using the `backgroundColor` property.
*   You can add a border to the pop-up by using the `border` property.
