              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  setState(() {
                    _rating = 4.8;
                  });
                },
                child: Text('Update Rating'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow:
// 1. The user runs the app and sees the animated rating bar with an initial rating of 4.5.
// 2. The user clicks the "Update Rating" button, which updates the rating to 4.8.
// 3. The animated rating bar smoothly animates to the new rating.
// 4. The user sees the updated rating text below the rating bar.
// The code uses the AnimatedRatingBar package to create a customizable and animated rating bar.
// The rating is updated using the setState method, which triggers the animation.
