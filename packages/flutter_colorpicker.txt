# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_colorpicker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the `flutter_colorpicker` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_colorpicker: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_colorpicker/flutter_colorpicker.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Color Picker
You can use the color picker in your widget tree. Below is a simple example of how to implement a color picker in a Flutter app.

### Android and iOS Specifics
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure you have the latest version of Xcode for compatibility.

## Step 4: Customization
You can customize the color picker by changing its properties, such as the initial color, the color picker type, and more. The package provides various options to tailor the color picker to your needs.

### Example of Customization
```dart
Color pickerColor = Colors.blue; // Initial color
```

This sets the initial color of the color picker to blue. You can change this to any color you prefer.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `flutter_colorpicker` package into your Flutter application and customize it to fit your needs.

# Complete Example of flutter_colorpicker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_colorpicker/flutter_colorpicker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Color Picker Example',
      home: ColorPickerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class ColorPickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ColorPickerDemoState createState() => _ColorPickerDemoState();
}

class _ColorPickerDemoState extends State<ColorPickerDemo> {
  Color pickerColor = Colors.blue; // Initial color
  Color currentColor = Colors.blue; // Current color displayed

  // Function to open the color picker dialog
  void openColorPicker() {
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
        return AlertDialog(
          title: Text('Pick a color!'),
          content: SingleChildScrollView(
            child: ColorPicker(
              pickerColor: pickerColor,
              onColorChanged: (Color color) {
                setState(() {
                  pickerColor = color; // Update the picker color
                });
              },
              // Optional: Add a color picker type
              pickerAreaHeightPercent: 0.7,
            ),
          ),
          actions: <Widget>[
            TextButton(
              child: Text('Select'),
              onPressed: () {
                setState(() {
                  currentColor = pickerColor; // Update the current color
                });
                Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
              },
            ),
          ],
        );
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Color Picker Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the currently selected color
            Container(
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              color: currentColor,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: openColorPicker, // Open the color picker
              child: Text('Open Color Picker'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and points to the ColorPickerDemo widget.
// 3. In ColorPickerDemo, we maintain two Color variables: pickerColor (for the color picker) and currentColor (for the displayed color).
// 4. The openColorPicker function shows a dialog with the ColorPicker widget.
// 5. When a color is selected, it updates pickerColor and, upon pressing 'Select', updates currentColor.
// 6. The selected color is displayed in a container, and the user can open the color picker again to choose a different color.
