# devtools_extensions Flutter Package

The `devtools_extensions` package is a powerful tool designed to enhance the development experience in Flutter applications. It provides a set of utilities that allow developers to easily integrate debugging and performance monitoring features into their apps. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to streamline their workflow and gain deeper insights into their applications during development.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `devtools_extensions` package when:
- You want to monitor the performance of your Flutter application in real-time.
- You need to debug complex UI issues and want to visualize widget trees.
- You are developing applications that require detailed logging and error tracking.

## Key Features
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track frame rendering times and identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Widget Inspector**: Visualize the widget tree and inspect properties of widgets in real-time.
- **Logging Utilities**: Enhanced logging capabilities to capture and display logs in a structured format.
- **Error Tracking**: Capture and report errors with detailed stack traces.

By integrating `devtools_extensions`, developers can significantly improve their debugging and performance analysis processes, leading to more efficient development cycles and higher-quality applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up devtools_extensions

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `devtools_extensions` package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `devtools_extensions` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  devtools_extensions: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/devtools_extensions).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain capabilities in your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file. Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:devtools_extensions/devtools_extensions.dart';
```

## Step 4: Initializing the Package

You can initialize the package in your `main.dart` file. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

```dart
void main() {
  // Initialize the devtools extensions
  DevToolsExtensions.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Using the Features

You can now use the features provided by the `devtools_extensions` package. For example, to log messages, you can use:

```dart
DevToolsExtensions.log('This is a log message');
```

To monitor performance, you can wrap your widget with the performance monitor:

```dart
PerformanceMonitor(
  child: MyWidget(),
);
```

This setup will allow you to leverage the full capabilities of the `devtools_extensions` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of devtools_extensions

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:devtools_extensions/devtools_extensions.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the devtools extensions
  DevToolsExtensions.initialize();
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Using PerformanceMonitor to track performance of the MyHomePage widget
    return PerformanceMonitor(
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'DevTools Extensions Example',
        theme: ThemeData(
          primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        ),
        home: MyHomePage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    // Log the counter increment action
    DevToolsExtensions.log('Counter incremented');
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Log the build method call
    DevToolsExtensions.log('Building MyHomePage');
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('DevTools Extensions Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            Text(
              '$_counter',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the DevToolsExtensions and runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a PerformanceMonitor.
// 3. MyHomePage is a StatefulWidget that maintains a counter state.
// 4. When the FloatingActionButton is pressed, the _incrementCounter method is called.
// 5. This method logs the action and increments the counter, triggering a rebuild of the widget.
// 6. The build method logs its execution and displays the current counter value on the screen.
```
