# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Vimeo Player Flutter Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `vimeo_player_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vimeo_player_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/vimeo_player_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that you have internet permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key to allow network access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the Vimeo player.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vimeo_player_flutter/vimeo_player_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Vimeo Player Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Vimeo Player Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: VimeoPlayer(
            // Replace with your Vimeo video ID
            videoId: '123456789',
            // Optional: Set the width and height of the player
            width: 300,
            height: 200,
            // Optional: Enable autoplay
            autoPlay: false,
            // Optional: Enable controls
            controls: true,
            // Optional: Callback for when the video is played
            onPlay: () {
              print('Video is playing');
            },
            // Optional: Callback for when the video is paused
            onPause: () {
              print('Video is paused');
            },
            // Optional: Callback for when the video ends
            onEnded: () {
              print('Video has ended');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code sets up a simple Flutter application that integrates the Vimeo player.
// 1. The main function runs the app, initializing the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title "Vimeo Player Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The VimeoPlayer widget is used to display the video, where you can specify the video ID, dimensions, and callbacks for play, pause, and end events.
// 6. The callbacks print messages to the console when the respective events occur, allowing you to track the video playback state.
```
