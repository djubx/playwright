# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Advanced In-App Review Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `advanced_in_app_review` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  advanced_in_app_review: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/advanced_in_app_review).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version should be 21 or higher
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to request permission for in-app reviews:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to prompt users for a review after a specific event, such as completing a task.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advanced_in_app_review/advanced_in_app_review.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('In-App Review Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Trigger the in-app review prompt
              final result = await AdvancedInAppReview.requestReview();
              // Handle the result if needed
              if (result == ReviewStatus.success) {
                print('Review prompt displayed successfully.');
              } else {
                print('Failed to display review prompt.');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Leave a Review'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Importing Packages**: The necessary packages are imported at the beginning.
- **Creating the App**: A simple Flutter app is created with a button that triggers the review prompt.
- **Requesting a Review**: When the button is pressed, the `requestReview` method is called, which displays the review prompt to the user.

# Complete Example of the Advanced In-App Review Package

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('In-App Review Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Trigger the in-app review prompt
              final result = await AdvancedInAppReview.requestReview();
              // Handle the result if needed
              if (result == ReviewStatus.success) {
                print('Review prompt displayed successfully.');
              } else {

              }
            },
            child: Text('Leave a Review'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
