# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flip Board Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **flip_board** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flip_board: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flip_board/flip_board.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

You can create a simple flip board by using the `FlipCard` widget. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
FlipCard(
  front: Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
    child: Center(child: Text('Front Side')),
  ),
  back: Container(
    color: Colors.red,
    child: Center(child: Text('Back Side')),
  ),
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing the Flip Animation

You can customize the flip animation by adjusting the `duration` and `curve` properties:

```dart
FlipCard(
  front: Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
    child: Center(child: Text('Front Side')),
  ),
  back: Container(
    color: Colors.red,
    child: Center(child: Text('Back Side')),
  ),
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 800),
  curve: Curves.easeInOut,
)
```

This allows you to create a more dynamic and visually appealing user experience.

# Complete Example of Using Flip Board

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flip_board/flip_board.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flip Board Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flip Board Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FlipCard(
            front: Container(
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Front Side',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            back: Container(
              color: Colors.red,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Back Side',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 800), // Duration of the flip animation
            curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Animation curve for the flip
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, we center a FlipCard widget.
// 5. The FlipCard has two sides: front and back, each with a different color and text.
// 6. The flip animation is triggered when the user taps on the card, flipping it to reveal the other side.
// 7. The duration and curve of the animation can be customized for a smoother experience.
```
