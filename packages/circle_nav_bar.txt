# Tutorial: Setting Up Circle Navigation Bar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **circle_nav_bar** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **circle_nav_bar** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  circle_nav_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **circle_nav_bar** in your app.

# Complete Example of Circle Navigation Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:circle_nav_bar/circle_nav_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Circle Nav Bar Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Variable to keep track of the selected index
  int _selectedIndex = 0;

  // List of widgets to display for each navigation item
  final List<Widget> _pages = [
    Center(child: Text('Home Page')),
    Center(child: Text('Search Page')),
    Center(child: Text('Profile Page')),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Circle Navigation Bar'),
      ),
      body: _pages[_selectedIndex], // Display the selected page
      bottomNavigationBar: CircleNavBar(
        items: <Widget>[
          Icon(Icons.home, size: 30),
          Icon(Icons.search, size: 30),
          Icon(Icons.person, size: 30),
        ],
        activeIndex: _selectedIndex, // Current selected index
        onTap: (index) {
          setState(() {
            _selectedIndex = index; // Update the selected index
          });
        },
        // Customize the appearance of the navigation bar
        circleColor: Colors.blue,
        backgroundColor: Colors.white,
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen is the main screen of the app, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. Inside HomeScreen, we maintain the _selectedIndex to track which page is currently displayed.
// 5. The _pages list contains the widgets for each page (Home, Search, Profile).
// 6. The Scaffold widget provides the structure, including an AppBar and a body that displays the selected page.
// 7. The CircleNavBar is implemented at the bottom, with icons for navigation.
// 8. When an icon is tapped, the onTap callback updates the _selectedIndex, causing the body to display the corresponding page.
```
