# Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_pos_printer_platform_image_3` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_pos_printer_platform_image_3: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
   ```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request Bluetooth permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to printers.</string>
   <key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to printers.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_pos_printer_platform_image_3/flutter_pos_printer_platform_image_3.dart';
```

## Step 4: Initialize and Use the Printer

You can now initialize the printer and use its features. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to connect to a printer and print an image.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pos_printer_platform_image_3/flutter_pos_printer_platform_image_3.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'POS Printer Example',
      home: PrinterExample(),
    );
  }
}

class PrinterExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PrinterExampleState createState() => _PrinterExampleState();
}

class _PrinterExampleState extends State<PrinterExample> {
  // Create an instance of the printer
  final PosPrinter printer = PosPrinter();

  // Function to connect to the printer
  Future<void> connectToPrinter() async {
    // Replace with your printer's IP address or Bluetooth address
    String printerAddress = '192.168.1.100'; // Example IP address
    await printer.connect(printerAddress);
  }

  // Function to print an image
  Future<void> printImage() async {
    // Load an image from assets
    final ByteData bytes = await rootBundle.load('assets/logo.png');
    final Uint8List imageData = bytes.buffer.asUint8List();

    // Print the image
    await printer.printImage(imageData);
  }

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    connectToPrinter(); // Connect to the printer on app start
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('POS Printer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: printImage, // Print image on button press
          child: Text('Print Image'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the MyApp widget.
// 2. The PrinterExample widget is created, which connects to the printer in its initState method.
// 3. When the user presses the "Print Image" button, the printImage method is called.
// 4. The app loads an image from the assets and sends it to the printer for printing.
```
