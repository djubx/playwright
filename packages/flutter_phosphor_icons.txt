# Complete Example of flutter_phosphor_icons

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_phosphor_icons/flutter_phosphor_icons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Phosphor Icons Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Phosphor Icons Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a Phosphor icon
              Icon(
                PhosphorIcons.heart,
                size: 50, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.red, // Customizing the color
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Using an IconButton with a Phosphor icon
              IconButton(
                icon: Icon(PhosphorIcons.arrow_right),
                iconSize: 50, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Customizing the color
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action to perform on button press
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Arrow Right Pressed!')),
                  );
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of the MaterialApp is set to a Scaffold, which provides the basic structure.
// 4. An AppBar is created with the title 'Phosphor Icons Demo'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 6. A Column widget is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 7. The first icon displayed is a heart icon from the Phosphor set, customized in size and color.
// 8. A SizedBox is used to add space between the heart icon and the button.
// 9. An IconButton is created with an arrow right icon, which shows a SnackBar message when pressed.
// 10. The app demonstrates how to use icons from the flutter_phosphor_icons package effectively.
