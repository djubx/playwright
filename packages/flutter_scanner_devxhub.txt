# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_scanner_devxhub

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_scanner_devxhub` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_scanner_devxhub: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_scanner_devxhub).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add camera permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FLASHLIGHT"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for scanning QR codes.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the photo library for scanning QR codes.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a scanner using the `flutter_scanner_devxhub` package.

# Complete Example of flutter_scanner_devxhub

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_scanner_devxhub/flutter_scanner_devxhub.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Scanner Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ScannerPage(),
    );
  }
}

class ScannerPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ScannerPageState createState() => _ScannerPageState();
}

class _ScannerPageState extends State<ScannerPage> {
  String scannedData = "Scan a code";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Scanner Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              scannedData,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Start the scanner and wait for the result
                String result = await FlutterScannerDevxhub.scan();
                // Update the scanned data
                setState(() {
                  scannedData = result ?? "Scan failed";
                });
              },
              child: Text('Start Scanning'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home page is set to ScannerPage, which contains the scanning logic.
// 4. In ScannerPage, a button is provided to start scanning.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the scanner is activated, and the result is awaited.
// 6. Once a code is scanned, the scanned data is displayed on the screen.
// 7. If the scan fails, a message is shown indicating the failure.
