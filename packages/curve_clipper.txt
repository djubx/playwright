# Curve Clipper Package Overview
The Curve Clipper package is a powerful Flutter package that allows developers to create custom curved shapes and clip them to their desired UI elements. It provides a simple and efficient way to create complex curved designs, making it a great addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit.

## When to Use Curve Clipper
The Curve Clipper package is perfect for creating custom curved shapes, such as:

* Rounded rectangles with custom corner radii
* Circular or oval shapes with custom sizes and positions
* Complex curved designs, such as waves or curves with multiple control points

## Features
The Curve Clipper package offers the following features:

* Customizable curve shapes and sizes
* Support for multiple curve types, including quadratic and cubic Bezier curves
* Ability to clip curves to specific UI elements, such as containers or images
* Easy-to-use API with minimal setup required

# Setting Up Curve Clipper
To use the Curve Clipper package, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your pubspec.yaml file:
```yml
dependencies:
  curve_clipper: ^1.0.0
```
2. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:curve_clipper/curve_clipper.dart';
```
3. Create a new instance of the CurveClipper class:
```dart
CurveClipper clipper = CurveClipper();
```
4. Define your curve shape and size using the CurveClipper API:
```dart
clipper.curve = Curve.quadraticBezier(
  controlPoint1: Offset(100, 100),
  controlPoint2: Offset(200, 200),
  end: Offset(300, 300),
);
```
5. Clip the curve to your desired UI element:
```dart
Container(
  child: ClipPath(
    clipper: clipper,
    child: Image.asset('assets/image.png'),
  ),
)
```
Note: For Android, you may need to add the following line to your AndroidManifest.xml file:
```xml
<application android:hardwareAccelerated="true">
```
For iOS, you may need to add the following line to your Info.plist file:
```xml
<key>UIViewEdgeAntialiasing</key>
<true/>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:curve_clipper/curve_clipper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a new instance of the CurveClipper class
    CurveClipper clipper = CurveClipper();

    // Define the curve shape and size
    clipper.curve = Curve.quadraticBezier(
      controlPoint1: Offset(100, 100),
      controlPoint2: Offset(200, 200),
      end: Offset(300, 300),
    );

    // Return a new MaterialApp with a Scaffold
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Curve Clipper Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Curve Clipper Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Container(
            // Clip the curve to the container
            child: ClipPath(
              clipper: clipper,
              // Display an image inside the clipped container
              child: Image.asset('assets/image.png'),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created and returned as the main app widget.
// 2. The CurveClipper instance is created and the curve shape and size are defined.
// 3. The curve is clipped to the container using the ClipPath widget.
// 4. The image is displayed inside the clipped container.
// 5. The app is rendered to the screen with the clipped curve and image.

// Final summary: The code flows by creating a CurveClipper instance, defining the curve shape and size, clipping the curve to a container, and displaying an image inside the clipped container. The app is then rendered to the screen with the final clipped curve and image.
