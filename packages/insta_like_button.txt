# Tutorial: Setting Up the Insta Like Button

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `insta_like_button` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `insta_like_button` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  insta_like_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to use any features that require user permissions.

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:insta_like_button/insta_like_button.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Insta Like Button
You can now use the `InstaLikeButton` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
InstaLikeButton(
  isLiked: false, // Initial state
  onTap: (isLiked) {
    // Handle the like button tap
    print('Button is now ${isLiked ? 'liked' : 'unliked'}');
  },
),
```

This will create a like button that toggles its state when tapped, and prints the current state to the console.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `insta_like_button` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Insta Like Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:insta_like_button/insta_like_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Insta Like Button Example',
      home: LikeButtonDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class LikeButtonDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LikeButtonDemoState createState() => _LikeButtonDemoState();
}

class _LikeButtonDemoState extends State<LikeButtonDemo> {
  // Variable to hold the like state
  bool _isLiked = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Insta Like Button Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: InstaLikeButton(
          isLiked: _isLiked, // Pass the current like state
          onTap: (isLiked) {
            // Update the state when the button is tapped
            setState(() {
              _isLiked = isLiked; // Update the like state
            });
            // Print the current state to the console
            print('Button is now ${isLiked ? 'liked' : 'unliked'}');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (LikeButtonDemo).
// 3. LikeButtonDemo is a StatefulWidget that maintains the like state.
// 4. The _LikeButtonDemoState class builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, the InstaLikeButton is created.
// 6. The isLiked property is set based on the current state (_isLiked).
// 7. When the button is tapped, the onTap callback updates the state and prints the current state to the console.
// 8. The UI updates automatically to reflect the new like state.
