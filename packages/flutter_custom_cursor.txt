# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_custom_cursor

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_custom_cursor` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_custom_cursor` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_custom_cursor: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_custom_cursor).

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_custom_cursor/flutter_custom_cursor.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Android

1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### For iOS

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and ensure you have the following configuration:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Step 4: Using the Custom Cursor

You can now use the custom cursor in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_custom_cursor/flutter_custom_cursor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: CustomCursorExample(),
    );
  }
}

class CustomCursorExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom Cursor Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: CustomCursor(
          cursor: CursorType.pointer, // Set the cursor type
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {},
            child: Text('Hover over me!'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that changes the cursor when hovered over.

## Step 5: Testing Your Application

Run your application on both Android and iOS devices to ensure that the custom cursor behaves as expected. You can also test it in a web environment to see how it enhances the user experience.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully implement the `flutter_custom_cursor` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of flutter_custom_cursor

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_custom_cursor/flutter_custom_cursor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Custom Cursor Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CustomCursorDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class CustomCursorDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Custom Cursor Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CustomCursor(
          cursor: CursorType.pointer, // Set the cursor type to pointer
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when button is pressed
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Hover over me!'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by running the RealFlutter class.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to CustomCursorDemo, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. In CustomCursorDemo, we create a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, we use CustomCursor to wrap an ElevatedButton.
// 6. The cursor type is set to pointer, which changes the cursor when hovering over the button.
// 7. When the button is pressed, a SnackBar is displayed to provide feedback to the user.
