# Complete Example of Custom Rich Text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_rich_text/custom_rich_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom Rich Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Custom Rich Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomRichText(
            text: [
              // First part of the text
              TextSpan(
                text: 'Welcome to ',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black, fontSize: 20),
              ),
              // Second part of the text with different style
              TextSpan(
                text: 'Flutter!',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              // Third part of the text with decoration
              TextSpan(
                text: ' Enjoy building beautiful apps.',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.green, fontSize: 20, decoration: TextDecoration.underline),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a title and a home property, which is a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold has an AppBar with a title and a body that centers the CustomRichText widget.
// 5. The CustomRichText widget takes a list of TextSpan objects, each with its own style.
// 6. The first TextSpan displays "Welcome to " in black, the second "Flutter!" in bold blue, and the third part in green with an underline.
// 7. This structure allows for rich text formatting within a single widget, enhancing the visual appeal of the text displayed.
