# Overview of the `app_to_foreground` Flutter Package

The `app_to_foreground` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows applications to bring themselves to the foreground programmatically. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where you want to alert users about important updates, notifications, or events that require their immediate attention. 

## When to Use This Package

- **Notifications**: If your app receives a notification that requires user interaction, you can use this package to bring the app to the foreground.
- **Background Tasks**: For apps that perform background tasks (like downloading files), you can prompt users to return to the app once the task is complete.
- **User Engagement**: To enhance user engagement by reminding users of ongoing activities or updates.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate with minimal setup.
- **Customizable Behavior**: Allows developers to define how and when the app should come to the foreground.

Overall, the `app_to_foreground` package is an essential tool for enhancing user experience and engagement in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `app_to_foreground` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `app_to_foreground` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  app_to_foreground: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
```

3. Add the following activity to your manifest:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:launchMode="singleTask">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/`.
2. Add the following key to request permission for notifications:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to bring your app to the foreground:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_to_foreground/app_to_foreground.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('App to Foreground Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            AppToForeground.moveToForeground();
          },
          child: Text('Bring App to Foreground'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the app will attempt to bring itself to the foreground.

# Complete Example of Using the `app_to_foreground` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_to_foreground/app_to_foreground.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'App to Foreground Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('App to Foreground Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // This function will bring the app to the foreground
            AppToForeground.moveToForeground();
          },
          child: Text('Bring App to Foreground'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is set as the home of the MaterialApp.
// 4. In the HomeScreen, an ElevatedButton is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered, calling the moveToForeground() method from the app_to_foreground package.
// 6. This method attempts to bring the app to the foreground, allowing users to interact with it immediately.
