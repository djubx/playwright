# Setting Up and Using Chalkdart

In this section, we will walk through the process of setting up the `chalkdart` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `chalkdart` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     chalkdart: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command to install the package:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package to start using it:
   ```dart
   import 'package:chalkdart/chalkdart.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:
  ```gradle
  defaultConfig {
      minSdkVersion 21
  }
  ```

### iOS

- Make sure your iOS deployment target is set to 10.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:
  ```ruby
  platform :ios, '10.0'
  ```

## Using Chalkdart

To use the `chalkdart` package, you can start by exploring its custom widgets and utility functions. For instance, you can use the `RealFlutter` class to create a custom-styled button:

```dart
RealFlutterButton(
  text: 'Click Me',
  onPressed: () {
    print('Button Pressed!');
  },
)
```

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `chalkdart` package. This example demonstrates the key features of the package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chalkdart/chalkdart.dart'; // Importing the chalkdart package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Chalkdart Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(), // Setting the home screen of the app
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chalkdart Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: RealFlutterButton(
          text: 'Click Me', // Button text
          onPressed: () {
            // Action to perform on button press
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The `main` function initializes the app by calling `runApp` with `MyApp`.
// `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The `HomeScreen` widget is defined as the home of the app, featuring an AppBar and a centered button.
// The `RealFlutterButton` from the `chalkdart` package is used to create a button with a text label.
// When the button is pressed, a SnackBar is displayed at the bottom of the screen, showing a message.
