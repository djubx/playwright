### Usage

To use the `playable_toolbar_flutter` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:playable_toolbar_flutter/playable_toolbar_flutter.dart';
```

You can then create a `RealFlutter` widget that incorporates the playable toolbar. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Playable Toolbar Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: PlayableToolbar(
          title: 'Track Title',
          artist: 'Artist Name',
          onPlay: () {
            // Handle play action
          },
          onPause: () {
            // Handle pause action
          },
          onSkip: () {
            // Handle skip action
          },
          onRewind: () {
            // Handle rewind action
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:playable_toolbar_flutter/playable_toolbar_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Playable Toolbar Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Playable Toolbar Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: PlayableToolbar(
          title: 'Track Title', // Display the title of the media
          artist: 'Artist Name', // Display the artist's name
          onPlay: () {
            // Handle play action
            print('Play button pressed');
          },
          onPause: () {
            // Handle pause action
            print('Pause button pressed');
          },
          onSkip: () {
            // Handle skip action
            print('Skip button pressed');
          },
          onRewind: () {
            // Handle rewind action
            print('Rewind button pressed');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main screen.
// 4. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a PlayableToolbar in the center.
// 5. The PlayableToolbar displays the media title and artist, and provides buttons for play, pause, skip, and rewind.
// 6. Each button has an associated callback that prints a message to the console when pressed, allowing for further action to be implemented.
```
