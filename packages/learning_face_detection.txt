// Final summary:
// The code flows as follows:
// 1. The user loads an image from the gallery or camera using the `_loadImage` function.
// 2. The user clicks the "Detect Faces" button, which calls the `_detectFaces` function.
// 3. The `_detectFaces` function uses the `LearningFaceDetection` package to detect faces in the loaded image.
// 4. The detected faces count is displayed on the screen using the `Text` widget.
// 5. The user can repeat the process by loading a new image and detecting faces again.
