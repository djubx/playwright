# Learning Face Detection Flutter Package

The `learning_face_detection` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate face detection capabilities into their applications. This package leverages machine learning models to detect faces in images and video streams, making it ideal for applications that require user interaction, security features, or augmented reality experiences.

## When to Use This Package
- **User Authentication**: Implement face recognition for secure logins.
- **Augmented Reality**: Enhance user experiences by overlaying digital content on detected faces.
- **Photo Applications**: Automatically tag or enhance photos based on detected faces.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Face Detection**: Detect faces in live camera feeds.
- **Image Processing**: Analyze static images for face detection.
- **Bounding Box**: Provides coordinates for detected faces, allowing for further processing or UI enhancements.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Learning Face Detection Package

## Installation
To get started with the `learning_face_detection` package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  learning_face_detection: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/learning_face_detection).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add camera permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for face detection.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library for face detection.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you will need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:learning_face_detection/learning_face_detection.dart';
```

You can then create a simple widget that utilizes the face detection features.

# Complete Example of Using Learning Face Detection

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:learning_face_detection/learning_face_detection.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Face Detection Example',
      home: FaceDetectionScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FaceDetectionScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FaceDetectionScreenState createState() => _FaceDetectionScreenState();
}

class _FaceDetectionScreenState extends State<FaceDetectionScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the detected faces
  List<Face> _detectedFaces = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the face detection process
    _initializeFaceDetection();
  }

  void _initializeFaceDetection() async {
    // Start the face detection process
    await LearningFaceDetection.startDetection((faces) {
      // Update the state with detected faces
      setState(() {
        _detectedFaces = faces;
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Face Detection'),
      ),
      body: Stack(
        children: [
          // Display the camera feed
          CameraPreview(),
          // Overlay detected faces
          ..._detectedFaces.map((face) {
            return Positioned(
              left: face.boundingBox.left,
              top: face.boundingBox.top,
              width: face.boundingBox.width,
              height: face.boundingBox.height,
              child: Container(
                decoration: BoxDecoration(
                  border: Border.all(color: Colors.red, width: 2),
                ),
              ),
            );
          }).toList(),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop face detection when the widget is disposed
    LearningFaceDetection.stopDetection();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

```
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// The FaceDetectionScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of detected faces.
// In the initState method, we initialize face detection and set a callback to update the state with detected faces.
// The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Stack to overlay the camera feed and detected faces.
// The CameraPreview widget displays the live camera feed, while the detected faces are drawn as red bounding boxes.
// The dispose method stops the face detection process when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
```
