# Redux Saga Flutter Package
==========================

The `redux_saga` package is a Flutter implementation of the popular Redux Saga library, which is used to manage side effects in Redux applications. It provides a simple way to handle asynchronous operations, such as API calls, and integrates well with the Redux state management system.

## When to Use Redux Saga

Redux Saga is particularly useful when you need to handle complex asynchronous operations, such as:

* API calls with multiple requests and responses
* File uploads and downloads
* Websocket connections
* Background tasks

## Features

The `redux_saga` package provides the following features:

* Support for asynchronous operations using the `call` effect
* Support for parallel execution of tasks using the `all` effect
* Support for cancellation of tasks using the `cancel` effect
* Integration with the Redux state management system

# Setting Up Redux Saga
=====================

To use the `redux_saga` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  redux_saga: ^0.10.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Creating a Saga

A saga is a function that returns a generator that yields effects. To create a saga, you need to import the `redux_saga` package and use the `saga` function:

```dart
import 'package:redux_saga/redux_saga.dart';

saga* mySaga() sync* {
  // Yield effects here
}
```

## Running a Saga

To run a saga, you need to create a `SagaMiddleware` instance and pass it to the `run` method:

```dart
import 'package:redux_saga/redux_saga.dart';

void main() {
  final sagaMiddleware = SagaMiddleware();
  sagaMiddleware.run(mySaga);
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

On Android, you need to add the following configuration to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<application
  ...
  android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
  ...>
</application>
```

This allows the app to make HTTP requests to the Redux Saga server.

### iOS

On iOS, you need to add the following configuration to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

This allows the app to make HTTP requests to the Redux Saga server.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:redux/redux.dart';
import 'package:redux_saga/redux_saga.dart';

// Create a Redux store
final store = Store<int>(
  (state, action) => state,
  initialState: 0,
);

// Create a saga middleware
final sagaMiddleware = SagaMiddleware();

// Create a saga
saga* mySaga() sync* {
  // Yield a call effect to make an API request
  final response = yield call(() => Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () => 'Hello, World!'));
  print(response);

  // Yield a put effect to dispatch an action
  yield put(IncrementAction());
}

// Run the saga
void main() {
  sagaMiddleware.run(mySaga);
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Redux Saga Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Redux Saga Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, World!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Define an action
class IncrementAction {}

// Define a reducer
int reducer(int state, dynamic action) {
  if (action is IncrementAction) {
    return state + 1;
  }
  return state;
}

// The app flow is as follows:
// 1. The app starts and runs the saga using the saga middleware.
// 2. The saga yields a call effect to make an API request.
// 3. The API request is made and the response is received.
// 4. The saga yields a put effect to dispatch an action.
// 5. The action is dispatched and the reducer is called.
// 6. The reducer updates the state and the app is re-rendered.

// The final state of the app is:
// {
//   "state": 1
// }
