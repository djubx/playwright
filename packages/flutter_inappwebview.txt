# Flutter InAppWebView Package

The `flutter_inappwebview` package is a powerful Flutter plugin that allows developers to embed web content directly into their Flutter applications. It provides a rich set of features for rendering web pages, handling navigation, and interacting with JavaScript, making it an excellent choice for applications that require web content integration.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `flutter_inappwebview` package in scenarios such as:

- **Displaying Web Content**: When you need to show web pages within your app without redirecting users to an external browser.
- **Web-Based Applications**: For hybrid applications that rely on web technologies but need to be packaged as native apps.
- **Custom Web Interactions**: When you want to interact with web content using JavaScript or handle specific navigation events.

## Key Features

- **Customizable WebView**: Offers extensive customization options for the WebView, including settings for caching, cookies, and user agent strings.
- **JavaScript Support**: Allows executing JavaScript code and handling JavaScript messages from the web content.
- **Navigation Control**: Provides methods to control navigation, including back and forward actions, and intercepting URL requests.
- **File Uploads**: Supports file uploads from the device to the web content.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

Overall, the `flutter_inappwebview` package is a versatile tool for integrating web content into Flutter applications, providing a native-like experience for users.

# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_inappwebview

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_inappwebview` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_inappwebview` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_inappwebview: ^5.3.2  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Enable JavaScript**: Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your WebView settings.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries to allow arbitrary loads:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Enable JavaScript**: JavaScript is enabled by default, but you can customize settings in your WebView.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple Flutter application that uses the `flutter_inappwebview` package to display a web page.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_inappwebview/flutter_inappwebview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  InAppWebViewController? webViewController;
  final GlobalKey webViewKey = GlobalKey();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("InAppWebView Example"),
      ),
      body: InAppWebView(
        key: webViewKey,
        initialUrlRequest: URLRequest(url: Uri.parse("https://flutter.dev")),
        onWebViewCreated: (controller) {
          webViewController = controller;
        },
        onLoadStart: (controller, url) {
          print("Loading: $url");
        },
        onLoadStop: (controller, url) async {
          print("Loaded: $url");
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with an `InAppWebView` that loads the Flutter website. The `onLoadStart` and `onLoadStop` callbacks allow you to track the loading state of the web page.

# Complete Example of flutter_inappwebview

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_inappwebview/flutter_inappwebview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  InAppWebViewController? webViewController; // Controller for the InAppWebView
  final GlobalKey webViewKey = GlobalKey(); // Key to identify the WebView

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("InAppWebView Example"), // Title of the app bar
      ),
      body: InAppWebView(
        key: webViewKey, // Assigning the key to the WebView
        initialUrlRequest: URLRequest(url: Uri.parse("https://flutter.dev")), // Initial URL to load
        onWebViewCreated: (controller) {
          webViewController = controller; // Storing the controller for later use
        },
        onLoadStart: (controller, url) {
          print("Loading: $url"); // Log the URL being loaded
        },
        onLoadStop: (controller, url) async {
          print("Loaded: $url"); // Log the URL that has finished loading
        },
        onLoadError: (controller, url, code, message) {
          print("Error loading: $url, Error: $message"); // Log any loading errors
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget being created.
// 2. The InAppWebView is initialized with a URL (https://flutter.dev).
// 3. The onWebViewCreated callback is triggered, storing the controller for future use.
// 4. As the web page loads, the onLoadStart and onLoadStop callbacks log the loading process.
// 5. If there are any errors during loading, the onLoadError callback logs the error message.
```

In this complete example, we have created a simple Flutter application that uses the `flutter_inappwebview` package to display a web page. The application flow is as follows:

1. The `RealFlutter` widget is instantiated, and the `build` method is called.
2. An `InAppWebView` is created with an initial URL pointing to the Flutter website.
3. The `onWebViewCreated` callback is triggered, allowing us to store the `InAppWebViewController` for later use.
4. The `onLoadStart` and `onLoadStop` callbacks log the loading process, providing feedback on the current URL being loaded.
5. If any errors occur during the loading process, they are logged via the `onLoadError` callback.

This example demonstrates the basic functionality of the `flutter_inappwebview` package, showcasing how to integrate web content into a Flutter application effectively.
