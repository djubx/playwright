**Setting Up the Code Scan Package**
=====================================

To use the `code_scan` package in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  code_scan: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:code_scan/code_scan.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create a Scan Screen

Create a new screen for scanning codes:
```dart
class ScanScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ScanScreenState createState() => _ScanScreenState();
}

class _ScanScreenState extends State<ScanScreen> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Scan Code'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CodeScan(
          onScan: (code) {
            print('Scanned code: $code');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
### Step 4: Handle Scan Results

Handle the scan results in the `onScan` callback:
```dart
CodeScan(
  onScan: (code) {
    print('Scanned code: $code');
    // Handle the scan result here
  },
)
```
### Platform-Specific Details

For Android, add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```
For iOS, add the following line to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs camera access to scan codes</string>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:code_scan/code_scan.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Code Scan Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ScanScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ScanScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ScanScreenState createState() => _ScanScreenState();
}

class _ScanScreenState extends State<ScanScreen> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Scan Code'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CodeScan(
          onScan: (code) {
            print('Scanned code: $code');
            // Handle the scan result here
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a scan screen.
// 2. The user scans a code using the camera.
// 3. The code is detected and the `onScan` callback is triggered.
// 4. The scan result is handled in the `onScan` callback.
// 5. The user can then perform an action based on the scan result.

// Summary:
// The code scan package provides a simple and efficient way to scan codes in Flutter applications.
// The package offers a range of features, including support for multiple code types and customizable scan screens.
// The application flow involves presenting the user with a scan screen, detecting the code, and handling the scan result.
