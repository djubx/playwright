```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_image_editor/flutter_image_editor.dart';

void main() => runApp(RealFlutterApp());

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: ImageEditorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ImageEditorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImageEditorScreenState createState() => _ImageEditorScreenState();
}

class _ImageEditorScreenState extends State<ImageEditorScreen> {
  // Placeholder for the image file
  ImageProvider _image = AssetImage('assets/sample.jpg');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Editor'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: Center(
              child: Image(image: _image),
            ),
          ),
          Row(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _rotateImage,
                child: Text('Rotate'),
              ),
              SizedBox(width: 10),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _flipImage,
                child: Text('Flip'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to rotate the image
  Future<void> _rotateImage() async {
    // Load the image from assets
    final image = await FlutterImageEditor.loadImage('assets/sample.jpg');
    // Rotate the image by 90 degrees
    final editedImage = await FlutterImageEditor.rotate(image, 90);
    // Update the state with the new image
    setState(() {
      _image = MemoryImage(editedImage);
    });
  }

  // Function to flip the image
  Future<void> _flipImage() async {
    // Load the image from assets
    final image = await FlutterImageEditor.loadImage('assets/sample.jpg');
    // Flip the image horizontally
    final editedImage = await FlutterImageEditor.flip(image, Flip.horizontal);
    // Update the state with the new image
    setState(() {
      _image = MemoryImage(editedImage);
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutterApp` widget, which sets up the MaterialApp and the home screen.
// 2. The `ImageEditorScreen` is a stateful widget that displays an image and provides buttons to edit it.
// 3. The image is initially loaded from assets and displayed using an `Image` widget.
// 4. Two buttons allow the user to rotate or flip the image.
// 5. When a button is pressed, the corresponding function (`_rotateImage` or `_flipImage`) is called.
// 6. These functions use the `FlutterImageEditor` to load, edit, and update the image.
// 7. The edited image is then displayed by updating the state with a `MemoryImage`.
