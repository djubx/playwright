# Setting Up the Synerise Flutter SDK

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the **synerise_flutter_sdk** and explain how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the **synerise_flutter_sdk** to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  synerise_flutter_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/synerise_flutter_sdk).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Usage

After installation and configuration, you can start using the **synerise_flutter_sdk** in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to initialize the SDK and track a user:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:synerise_flutter_sdk/synerise_flutter_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Synerise SDK
    Synerise.init('YOUR_API_KEY');
  }

  void trackUser() {
    // Track a user event
    Synerise.trackUser('user_id', 'user_email@example.com');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Synerise SDK Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: trackUser,
          child: Text('Track User'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the Synerise SDK with an API key and track a user when a button is pressed. Make sure to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual Synerise API key.

# Complete Example of Synerise Flutter SDK

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:synerise_flutter_sdk/synerise_flutter_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Synerise SDK with your API key
    Synerise.init('YOUR_API_KEY');
  }

  void trackUser() {
    // Track a user event with user ID and email
    Synerise.trackUser('user_id', 'user_email@example.com');
  }

  void logEvent() {
    // Log a custom event
    Synerise.logEvent('button_clicked', {'button_name': 'Track User'});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Synerise SDK Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                trackUser(); // Track user when button is pressed
                logEvent();  // Log the button click event
              },
              child: Text('Track User and Log Event'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. In HomeScreen's initState, the Synerise SDK is initialized with the API key.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the trackUser method is called to track the user.
// 5. Simultaneously, the logEvent method logs a custom event indicating that the button was clicked.
// 6. This allows you to monitor user interactions and track events for analytics purposes.
