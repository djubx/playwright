# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Separated Row

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **separated_row** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  separated_row: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using Separated Row

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:separated_row/separated_row.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Separated Row Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SeparatedRow(
            separatorBuilder: (context, index) => SizedBox(width: 20), // Custom spacing
            children: [
              Icon(Icons.home, size: 50),
              Icon(Icons.favorite, size: 50),
              Icon(Icons.settings, size: 50),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a row of icons separated by a fixed width of 20 pixels.

# Complete Example of Separated Row

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:separated_row/separated_row.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Separated Row Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the SeparatedRow widget in the body
          child: SeparatedRow(
            // Defining the separator between items
            separatorBuilder: (context, index) => SizedBox(width: 20), // Custom spacing of 20 pixels
            children: [
              // Adding icons to the row
              Icon(Icons.home, size: 50), // Home icon
              Icon(Icons.favorite, size: 50), // Favorite icon
              Icon(Icons.settings, size: 50), // Settings icon
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we use SeparatedRow to create a horizontal layout of icons.
// 5. The separatorBuilder defines the space between each icon, which is set to 20 pixels.
// 6. The children of SeparatedRow are the icons, which are displayed in a row with the specified spacing.
```
