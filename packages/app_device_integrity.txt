# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `app_device_integrity` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `app_device_integrity` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  app_device_integrity: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/app_device_integrity).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to check the device integrity.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_device_integrity/app_device_integrity.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Device Integrity Check')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Check device integrity
              final integrityResult = await AppDeviceIntegrity.checkDeviceIntegrity();
              // Display the result
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Device Integrity Result'),
                  content: Text(integrityResult ? 'Device is secure' : 'Device is compromised'),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                      child: Text('OK'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Check Device Integrity'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the app checks the device's integrity and displays the result in a dialog.

# Complete Example of Using the `app_device_integrity` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_device_integrity/app_device_integrity.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Device Integrity Check')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Check device integrity
              final integrityResult = await AppDeviceIntegrity.checkDeviceIntegrity();
              // Display the result
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Device Integrity Result'),
                  content: Text(integrityResult ? 'Device is secure' : 'Device is compromised'),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                      child: Text('OK'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Check Device Integrity'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. Inside the callback, the app calls the checkDeviceIntegrity method from the AppDeviceIntegrity package.
// 6. The result of the integrity check is stored in the integrityResult variable.
// 7. A dialog is displayed showing whether the device is secure or compromised based on the integrityResult.
// 8. The user can dismiss the dialog by pressing the 'OK' button.
```

In summary, the `app_device_integrity` package provides a straightforward way to check the integrity of the device running your Flutter application. By following the setup and usage instructions, you can easily integrate this package into your app, enhancing its security and protecting sensitive user data.
