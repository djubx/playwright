```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
After installation, you can start using the package in your Dart files. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use some of the utilities provided by `dartlang_utils`:

```dart
import 'package:dartlang_utils/dartlang_utils.dart';

void main() {
  // Example of using string utilities
  String exampleString = "  Hello, Dart!  ";
  String trimmedString = StringUtils.trim(exampleString);
  print(trimmedString); // Output: "Hello, Dart!"

  // Example of using date utilities
  DateTime now = DateTime.now();
  String formattedDate = DateUtils.formatDate(now);
  print(formattedDate); // Output: "MM/DD/YYYY"
}
```

This example demonstrates how to import the package and utilize its string and date utilities effectively.

# Complete Example of Using dartlang_utils

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dartlang_utils/dartlang_utils.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'DartLang Utils Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('DartLang Utils Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: UtilsDemo(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class UtilsDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Example string manipulation
    String exampleString = "  Welcome to DartLang Utils!  ";
    String trimmedString = StringUtils.trim(exampleString); // Trimming whitespace

    // Example date formatting
    DateTime now = DateTime.now();
    String formattedDate = DateUtils.formatDate(now); // Formatting current date

    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text(trimmedString), // Displaying trimmed string
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        Text('Current Date: $formattedDate'), // Displaying formatted date
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered UtilsDemo widget.
// 3. The UtilsDemo widget performs string and date manipulations using the dartlang_utils package.
// 4. It trims the example string and formats the current date, displaying both results in a column layout.
// 5. The trimmed string and formatted date are shown on the screen, demonstrating the utility functions in action.
