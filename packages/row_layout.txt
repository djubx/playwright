## <-- START_DESCRIPTION -->

### Description

The `row_layout` Flutter package is designed to simplify the process of creating responsive and flexible layouts using rows. It provides developers with an easy way to manage the alignment, spacing, and distribution of widgets within a row, making it an excellent choice for building user interfaces that require a structured layout.

### When to Use

You might consider using the `row_layout` package when:
- You need to create a responsive UI that adapts to different screen sizes.
- You want to manage the alignment and spacing of multiple widgets in a row without writing extensive custom code.
- You are looking for a package that enhances the default `Row` widget capabilities in Flutter.

### Features

- **Flexible Alignment**: Easily align children widgets within a row using various alignment options.
- **Custom Spacing**: Control the spacing between widgets with customizable padding and margins.
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adjust the layout based on screen size and orientation.
- **Nested Rows**: Support for nesting rows within rows for complex layouts.

### Tutorial

#### Installation

To get started with the `row_layout` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  row_layout: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

#### Platform-Specific Details

The `row_layout` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms. You may need to configure your Android and iOS projects to support the latest Flutter features.

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

For iOS, make sure your `ios/Podfile` is updated to support the latest iOS versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

#### Basic Usage

To use the `row_layout` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:row_layout/row_layout.dart';
```

You can then create a simple row layout as follows:

```dart
RowLayout(
  alignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
  children: [
    Text('Item 1'),
    Text('Item 2'),
    Text('Item 3'),
  ],
);
```

This will create a row with three text items spaced evenly across the available width.

### Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:row_layout/row_layout.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Row Layout Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Row Layout Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RowLayout(
            // Using RowLayout to manage the layout of children
            alignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Center the items in the row
            spacing: 20.0, // Set spacing between items
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action for Button 1
                },
                child: Text('Button 1'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action for Button 2
                },
                child: Text('Button 2'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action for Button 3
                },
                child: Text('Button 3'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application with a RowLayout.
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a RowLayout is created to manage the layout of three buttons.
// 5. The RowLayout is centered and has a spacing of 20.0 between the buttons.
// 6. Each button has an onPressed callback that can be customized for specific actions.
// 7. This structure allows for a clean and responsive layout of buttons in a row.
```
