# Huawei Location Flutter Package

The `huawei_location` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to integrate location services into their Flutter applications using Huawei's location services. This package provides a seamless way to access location data, including GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular network-based positioning, making it ideal for applications that require precise location tracking.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `huawei_location` package in scenarios such as:

- **Navigation Applications**: For apps that require real-time location tracking and navigation features.
- **Geofencing**: To create virtual boundaries and trigger actions when a user enters or exits a specified area.
- **Location-Based Services**: For applications that provide services based on the user's current location, such as finding nearby restaurants or events.

## Features

- **Real-time Location Updates**: Get continuous updates on the user's location.
- **Geofencing Support**: Set up geofences and receive notifications when the user enters or exits these areas.
- **Location Accuracy**: Access high-accuracy location data using GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular networks.
- **Battery Optimization**: The package includes features to optimize battery usage while tracking location.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Huawei Location Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `huawei_location` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  huawei_location: ^5.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION"/>

    <application>
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.huawei.hms.client.appid"
            android:value="YOUR_APP_ID"/> <!-- Replace with your actual App ID -->
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure that your `android/build.gradle` file includes the necessary repositories:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.0.0'
        classpath 'com.huawei.agconnect:agcp:1.6.0.300' // Add this line
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services even when the app is in the background.</string>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed and run `pod install` in the `ios` directory.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a complete example demonstrating how to use the `huawei_location` package.

# Complete Example of Using Huawei Location Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:huawei_location/huawei_location.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  LocationClient? _locationClient; // Declare a LocationClient
  String _locationMessage = "Location not available"; // Message to display location

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeLocation(); // Initialize location services
  }

  // Initialize the location client and request location updates
  void _initializeLocation() async {
    _locationClient = LocationClient(); // Create a new instance of LocationClient
    await _locationClient!.startLocationUpdates(); // Start receiving location updates

    // Listen for location updates
    _locationClient!.onLocationChanged.listen((Location location) {
      setState(() {
        _locationMessage = "Latitude: ${location.latitude}, Longitude: ${location.longitude}"; // Update the location message
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _locationClient?.stopLocationUpdates(); // Stop location updates when the widget is disposed
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Huawei Location Example")),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(_locationMessage), // Display the current location
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that uses the Huawei Location package to display the user's current location. 

// **Application Flow Explanation:**
// 1. The `main` function runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. In the `RealFlutter` state, we declare a `LocationClient` to manage location services and a string to hold the location message.
// 3. The `_initializeLocation` method is called in `initState`, where we create an instance of `LocationClient` and start receiving location updates.
// 4. We listen for location changes using `onLocationChanged` and update the `_locationMessage` state variable with the new latitude and longitude.
// 5. The `dispose` method stops location updates when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
// 6. The `build` method displays the current location in the center of the screen.
