# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_better_camera

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_better_camera` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_better_camera` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_better_camera: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_better_camera).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera and microphone permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the camera for capturing photos and videos.</string>
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the microphone for recording audio with videos.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a complete example demonstrating how to implement the `flutter_better_camera` package.

# Complete Example of flutter_better_camera

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_better_camera/flutter_better_camera.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Better Camera Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late BetterCameraController _cameraController; // Declare the camera controller
  bool _isCameraInitialized = false; // Track camera initialization status

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeCamera(); // Initialize the camera when the widget is created
  }

  Future<void> _initializeCamera() async {
    // Create a camera controller with desired settings
    _cameraController = BetterCameraController(
      CameraDescription(
        // Use the first available camera
        lensDirection: CameraLensDirection.back,
        sensorOrientation: 0,
      ),
      ResolutionPreset.high, // Set the resolution to high
    );

    // Initialize the camera
    await _cameraController.initialize();
    setState(() {
      _isCameraInitialized = true; // Update the state to reflect initialization
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _cameraController.dispose(); // Dispose of the camera controller when done
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Better Camera'),
      ),
      body: _isCameraInitialized
          ? Column(
              children: [
                // Display the camera preview
                AspectRatio(
                  aspectRatio: _cameraController.value.aspectRatio,
                  child: BetterCameraPreview(_cameraController),
                ),
                // Capture button
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: _captureImage,
                  child: Text('Capture Image'),
                ),
                // Record button
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: _recordVideo,
                  child: Text('Record Video'),
                ),
              ],
            )
          : Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()), // Show loading indicator while initializing
    );
  }

  Future<void> _captureImage() async {
    // Capture an image and save it to the device
    final image = await _cameraController.takePicture();
    // Handle the captured image (e.g., save or display)
    print('Image captured: ${image.path}');
  }

  Future<void> _recordVideo() async {
    // Start video recording
    await _cameraController.startVideoRecording();
    // Stop recording after a delay (e.g., 5 seconds)
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 5));
    final video = await _cameraController.stopVideoRecording();
    // Handle the recorded video (e.g., save or display)
    print('Video recorded: ${video.path}');
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, initializing the camera controller in initState.
// 3. The camera is initialized, and the state is updated to reflect this.
// 4. The camera preview is displayed using BetterCameraPreview.
// 5. Users can capture an image or record a video using the provided buttons.
// 6. The captured image or recorded video path is printed to the console for further handling.
