// This is the main entry point of the application.
// The RealFlutter class is a stateful widget that contains a text field for the meeting ID and password,
// and a button to join the meeting.
// When the button is pressed, the _joinMeeting function is called, which gets the meeting ID and password
// from the text fields, creates a new Zoom meeting instance, and joins the meeting.
// The meeting events are handled by the onMeetingEvent stream.

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user enters the meeting ID and password in the text fields.
// 2. The user presses the "Join Meeting" button.
// 3. The _joinMeeting function is called, which gets the meeting ID and password from the text fields.
// 4. A new Zoom meeting instance is created with the meeting ID and password.
// 5. The joinMeeting method is called on the Zoom meeting instance, which joins the meeting.
// 6. The meeting events are handled by the onMeetingEvent stream.
