# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Draggable Widget Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `draggable_widget` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  draggable_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. However, for basic draggable functionality, no specific configurations are necessary.

## Step 3: Using the Draggable Widget
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using the `DraggableWidget` in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:draggable_widget/draggable_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Draggable Widget Example')),
        body: Stack(
          children: [
            DraggableWidget(
              child: Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Center(child: Text('Drag me!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
              ),
              feedback: Material(
                child: Container(
                  width: 100,
                  height: 100,
                  color: Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.7),
                  child: Center(child: Text('Dragging!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
                ),
              ),
              childWhenDragging: Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: Colors.grey,
                child: Center(child: Text('I am here!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a draggable blue box that users can move around the screen. The `feedback` parameter allows you to customize the appearance of the widget while it is being dragged, and the `childWhenDragging` parameter shows what happens to the original widget when it is being dragged.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `draggable_widget` package into your Flutter application and start creating interactive UIs.

# Complete Example of Draggable Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:draggable_widget/draggable_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Draggable Widget Example')),
        body: Stack(
          children: [
            // Creating a draggable widget
            DraggableWidget(
              // The main widget that will be draggable
              child: Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Center(child: Text('Drag me!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
              ),
              // The widget that appears while dragging
              feedback: Material(
                child: Container(
                  width: 100,
                  height: 100,
                  color: Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.7),
                  child: Center(child: Text('Dragging!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
                ),
              ),
              // The widget that replaces the original while dragging
              childWhenDragging: Container(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                color: Colors.grey,
                child: Center(child: Text('I am here!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Stack.
// 3. Inside the Stack, a DraggableWidget is created.
// 4. The child of the DraggableWidget is a blue container with the text "Drag me!".
// 5. When the user drags the widget, the feedback widget (a semi-transparent blue container) is shown.
// 6. The original widget is replaced with a grey container that says "I am here!" while dragging.
// 7. This setup allows for a simple and interactive draggable experience in the Flutter app.
