# Setting Up and Using `flutter_mosaic`

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_mosaic` package and provide platform-specific details for both Android and iOS.

## Installation

To add `flutter_mosaic` to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_mosaic: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_mosaic).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `flutter_mosaic` package, you can create a simple mosaic layout by following these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_mosaic/flutter_mosaic.dart';
   ```

2. Create a `Mosaic` widget in your widget tree:
   ```dart
   Mosaic(
     children: [
       // Add your mosaic tiles here
     ],
   );
   ```

3. Customize the tiles as needed, adjusting their sizes and properties.

With this setup, you can start building your mosaic layout!

# Complete Example of `flutter_mosaic`

Here is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `flutter_mosaic` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_mosaic/flutter_mosaic.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Mosaic Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Mosaic Example'),
        ),
        body: Mosaic(
          children: [
            // Creating a mosaic layout with different sized tiles
            MosaicTile(
              child: Container(color: Colors.red, height: 200),
              size: 2, // This tile takes up 2 columns
            ),
            MosaicTile(
              child: Container(color: Colors.blue, height: 100),
              size: 1, // This tile takes up 1 column
            ),
            MosaicTile(
              child: Container(color: Colors.green, height: 150),
              size: 1, // This tile takes up 1 column
            ),
            MosaicTile(
              child: Container(color: Colors.yellow, height: 300),
              size: 2, // This tile takes up 2 columns
            ),
            MosaicTile(
              child: Container(color: Colors.purple, height: 100),
              size: 1, // This tile takes up 1 column
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of a Mosaic widget that holds multiple MosaicTile widgets.
// 5. Each MosaicTile has a child Container with a specific color and height.
// 6. The size property of each MosaicTile determines how many columns it occupies in the mosaic layout.
// 7. The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, providing a visually appealing arrangement of tiles.
```

### Summary of the Code Flow
The provided code initializes a Flutter application that showcases the `flutter_mosaic` package. The `Mosaic` widget is used to create a dynamic grid layout, where each `MosaicTile` can have different sizes and colors. The application is structured to be responsive, allowing it to adapt to various screen sizes while maintaining an engaging visual presentation. Each tile's size is defined, enabling a flexible arrangement that enhances the user experience.
