# Flutter Neumorphic Plus Package

The `flutter_neumorphic_plus` package is a powerful Flutter library that allows developers to create beautiful, soft, and modern user interfaces using the neumorphism design trend. Neumorphism, or soft UI, is characterized by subtle shadows and highlights that create a sense of depth and realism, making UI elements appear as if they are extruded from the background.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using `flutter_neumorphic_plus` when:
- You want to create a modern and visually appealing UI that stands out.
- Your application requires a soft, tactile feel that enhances user interaction.
- You are building applications that benefit from a minimalistic design approach.

## Features

- **Customizable Neumorphic Widgets**: The package provides a variety of customizable widgets that can be easily integrated into your Flutter application.
- **Light and Dark Themes**: It supports both light and dark themes, allowing for a seamless user experience across different environments.
- **Responsive Design**: The widgets are designed to be responsive, ensuring they look great on various screen sizes and orientations.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is easy to integrate into existing Flutter projects, with minimal setup required.

Overall, `flutter_neumorphic_plus` is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with a modern design aesthetic.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flutter Neumorphic Plus

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_neumorphic_plus` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_neumorphic_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_neumorphic_plus: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that the project settings are configured to support Swift.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a neumorphic button using the `flutter_neumorphic_plus` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_neumorphic_plus/flutter_neumorphic_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Neumorphic Plus Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Neumorphic Plus Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: NeumorphicButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action when button is pressed
          },
          style: NeumorphicStyle(
            depth: 8, // Depth of the button
            color: Colors.grey[300], // Background color
            shape: NeumorphicShape.convex, // Button shape
          ),
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a neumorphic button. The button has a depth of 8, a light grey background, and a convex shape.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we covered the setup process for the `flutter_neumorphic_plus` package, including platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS. We also demonstrated how to create a simple neumorphic button in a Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Flutter Neumorphic Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_neumorphic_plus/flutter_neumorphic_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Neumorphic Plus Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Home widget
    );
  }
}

// Main widget demonstrating neumorphic design
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Neumorphic Plus Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: NeumorphicButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action when button is pressed
            print('Button Pressed!'); // Log button press
          },
          style: NeumorphicStyle(
            depth: 8, // Depth of the button for shadow effect
            color: Colors.grey[300], // Background color of the button
            shape: NeumorphicShape.convex, // Shape of the button
          ),
          child: Text('Press Me'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp with MyApp.
2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main widget.
4. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
5. Inside the Center widget, a NeumorphicButton is created.
6. The button has an onPressed callback that prints 'Button Pressed!' to the console when tapped.
7. The NeumorphicButton is styled with a depth of 8, a light grey background, and a convex shape.
8. When the button is pressed, the action defined in the onPressed callback is executed.
