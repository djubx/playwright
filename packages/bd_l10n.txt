# Setting Up and Using bd_l10n

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `bd_l10n` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To get started, you need to add the `bd_l10n` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bd_l10n: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/bd_l10n).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21.

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to support localization:

```xml
<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
<array>
    <string>en</string>
    <string>es</string>
    <!-- Add other languages as needed -->
</array>
```

## Using bd_l10n

1. **Create Localization Files**: Create JSON files for each language you want to support. For example:
   - `assets/lang/en.json`
   - `assets/lang/es.json`

2. **Load Localization Files**: In your main application file, load the localization files using `bd_l10n`.

3. **Access Translations**: Use the provided methods to access translations in your widgets.

Here’s a simple example of how to implement localization in your Flutter app using `bd_l10n`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bd_l10n/bd_l10n.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Localization Example',
      localizationsDelegates: [
        BdLocalization.delegate,
        GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,
      ],
      supportedLocales: [
        const Locale('en', ''), // English
        const Locale('es', ''), // Spanish
      ],
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(BdLocalization.of(context).translate('app_title')),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(BdLocalization.of(context).translate('welcome_message')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we set up a simple Flutter app that uses the `bd_l10n` package to display localized text based on the user's selected language.

# Complete Example of bd_l10n in Action

Here’s a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `bd_l10n` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bd_l10n/bd_l10n.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Localization Example',
      localizationsDelegates: [
        BdLocalization.delegate, // Delegate for bd_l10n
        GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate, // Material localization
        GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate, // Widget localization
        GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate, // Cupertino localization
      ],
      supportedLocales: [
        const Locale('en', ''), // English locale
        const Locale('es', ''), // Spanish locale
      ],
      home: HomeScreen(), // Home screen widget
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(BdLocalization.of(context).translate('app_title')), // Localized app title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(BdLocalization.of(context).translate('welcome_message')), // Localized welcome message
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with localization delegates and supported locales.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home of the app.
// 4. In HomeScreen, the AppBar title and body text are fetched using BdLocalization to get the appropriate translations based on the current locale.
// 5. The app will display the title and welcome message in the user's preferred language, enhancing the user experience.
