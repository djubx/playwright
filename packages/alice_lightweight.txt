# Setup and Usage of Alice Lightweight

## Installation
To add the **alice_lightweight** package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  alice_lightweight: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/alice_lightweight).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the **alice_lightweight** package, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. Import the package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:alice_lightweight/alice_lightweight.dart';
   ```

2. Create an instance of Alice:
   ```dart
   final Alice alice = Alice();
   ```

3. Use the Alice instance to monitor your HTTP requests. You can do this by wrapping your `MaterialApp` with the `Alice` widget.

4. To view the logs, you can navigate to the Alice UI, which will display all the captured requests.

This setup allows you to start monitoring your network requests immediately.

# Complete Example of Using Alice Lightweight

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alice_lightweight/alice_lightweight.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create an instance of Alice
  final Alice alice = Alice();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Alice Lightweight Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
      // Wrap the MaterialApp with Alice to enable monitoring
      navigatorObservers: [alice.getObserver()],
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Alice Lightweight Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Trigger a network request when the button is pressed
            fetchData();
          },
          child: Text('Fetch Data'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to fetch data from a sample API
  void fetchData() async {
    // Make a GET request to a sample API
    final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'));

    // Check if the request was successful
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      // If successful, print the response body
      print('Response data: ${response.body}');
    } else {
      // If not successful, print the error
      print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget creates an instance of Alice and wraps the MaterialApp with it.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget displays a button that, when pressed, triggers the fetchData function.
// 4. The fetchData function makes a GET request to a sample API and logs the response.
// 5. All network requests and responses are monitored by Alice, which can be viewed in the Alice UI.
