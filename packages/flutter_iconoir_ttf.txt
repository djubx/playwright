# Complete Example of flutter_iconoir_ttf

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_iconoir_ttf/flutter_iconoir_ttf.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Iconoir Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Iconoir Icons in Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a home icon
              Icon(
                IconoirIcons.home,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a settings icon
              Icon(
                IconoirIcons.settings,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a user icon
              Icon(
                IconoirIcons.user,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Iconoir Icons in Flutter'.
// The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// A Column widget is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// Each Icon widget uses an icon from the IconoirIcons class, with specified size and color.
// SizedBox widgets are used to add spacing between the icons for better visual separation.
// The application demonstrates how to use multiple icons from the Iconoir set with different colors and sizes.
