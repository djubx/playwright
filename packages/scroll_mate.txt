## Tutorial

### Installation

To get started with the `scroll_mate` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scroll_mate: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/scroll_mate).

### Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Basic Usage

To use the `scroll_mate` package, you can wrap your scrollable widgets with `ScrollMate` and customize the scroll effects as needed. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scroll_mate/scroll_mate.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Scroll Mate Example')),
      body: ScrollMate(
        child: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 100,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(title: Text('Item $index'));
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we wrap a `ListView` with `ScrollMate`, which allows us to apply custom scroll effects.

## Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scroll_mate/scroll_mate.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scroll Mate Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Scroll Mate Example')),
        body: ScrollMate(
          // Wrapping the ListView with ScrollMate for custom scroll effects
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: 100, // Total number of items in the list
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              // Building each item in the list
              return ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'), // Displaying item number
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to a Scaffold widget, which provides the basic structure of the app.
// 4. An AppBar is created with the title 'Scroll Mate Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a ScrollMate widget, which enhances the scrolling experience.
// 6. Inside ScrollMate, a ListView.builder is used to create a scrollable list of items.
// 7. The itemCount is set to 100, meaning the list will have 100 items.
// 8. The itemBuilder function constructs each ListTile, displaying the item number.
// 9. As the user scrolls through the list, the ScrollMate package applies any custom scroll effects defined.
