# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using SuperwallKit Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **superwallkit_flutter** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **superwallkit_flutter** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  superwallkit_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if your wall features require internet access or other permissions.

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add any required permissions, such as:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:superwallkit_flutter/superwallkit_flutter.dart';
   ```

2. Initialize the **RealFlutter** class and configure it according to your needs. You can customize the wall's appearance and behavior.

3. Use the **RealFlutter** widget in your widget tree to display the wall.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the **RealFlutter** class in your app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:superwallkit_flutter/superwallkit_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SuperwallKit Example',
      home: WallScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class WallScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SuperwallKit Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: RealFlutter(
        // Configuration options for the wall
        wallTitle: 'My Interactive Wall',
        onPostTap: (post) {
          // Handle post tap
          print('Post tapped: ${post.title}');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a wall with a title and handles post taps.

# Complete Example of SuperwallKit Flutter

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates all key features of the **superwallkit_flutter** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:superwallkit_flutter/superwallkit_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SuperwallKit Example',
      home: WallScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class WallScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SuperwallKit Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: RealFlutter(
        // Configuration options for the wall
        wallTitle: 'My Interactive Wall', // Title of the wall
        onPostTap: (post) {
          // Handle post tap
          print('Post tapped: ${post.title}'); // Log the tapped post title
        },
        onLikePost: (post) {
          // Handle like action
          print('Post liked: ${post.title}'); // Log the liked post title
        },
        onCommentPost: (post) {
          // Handle comment action
          print('Comment on post: ${post.title}'); // Log the commented post title
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets WallScreen as the home widget.
// 3. WallScreen creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing the RealFlutter widget.
// 4. The RealFlutter widget is configured with a title and callbacks for post interactions.
// 5. When a post is tapped, liked, or commented on, the respective callback is triggered, logging the action to the console.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this complete example, we have created a simple Flutter application that utilizes the **superwallkit_flutter** package. The application consists of a wall that displays posts, and it handles user interactions such as tapping, liking, and commenting on posts.

### Summary of Application Flow

- The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the Flutter app.
- The `MyApp` class sets up the main structure of the app, including the title and home screen.
- The `WallScreen` class contains the main UI, including an AppBar and the **RealFlutter** widget.
- The **RealFlutter** widget is configured to handle user interactions, logging actions to the console for demonstration purposes.

This structure allows developers to easily integrate and customize wall features in their Flutter applications using the **superwallkit_flutter** package.
