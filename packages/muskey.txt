# Setting Up and Using Muskey
=============================

### Step 1: Add Muskey to Your Project

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  muskey: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import Muskey

Import the Muskey package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:muskey/muskey.dart';
```

### Step 3: Initialize Muskey

Initialize Muskey in your `main` function:

```dart
void main() {
  Muskey.init();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### Platform-Specific Configurations

#### Android

Add the following configuration to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<application
  ...
  android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
  ...>
</application>
```

#### iOS

Add the following configuration to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:muskey/muskey.dart';

void main() {
  Muskey.init();
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize Muskey
  final _muskey = Muskey();

  // Define a function to handle Muskey events
  void _handleMuskeyEvent(dynamic event) {
    print('Muskey event: $event');
  }

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Listen for Muskey events
    _muskey.onEvent.listen(_handleMuskeyEvent);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop listening for Muskey events
    _muskey.onEvent.cancel();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Muskey Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Muskey Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Muskey is initialized and listening for events.',
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, which initializes Muskey in the main function.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which listens for Muskey events.
// 3. When a Muskey event is received, the _handleMuskeyEvent function is called.
// 4. The _handleMuskeyEvent function prints the event to the console.
// 5. The app continues to run and listen for Muskey events until it is closed.

// In summary, this code initializes Muskey, listens for Muskey events, and handles the events when they are received.
```
