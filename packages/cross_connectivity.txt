# Cross Connectivity Flutter Package

The `cross_connectivity` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers manage network connectivity across different platforms in a Flutter application. It provides a seamless way to monitor network status changes and handle connectivity issues gracefully, ensuring that your app remains responsive and user-friendly even in fluctuating network conditions.

## When to Use

- **Real-time Applications**: Apps that require constant internet connectivity, such as chat applications or live data feeds.
- **Offline Support**: Applications that need to handle offline scenarios gracefully, providing cached data or alternative functionality when the network is unavailable.
- **Network-sensitive Features**: Features that should only be available when the device is connected to a network, such as video streaming or large file downloads.

## Features

- **Platform Agnostic**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Real-time Connectivity Updates**: Provides real-time updates on network status changes.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to define custom actions based on connectivity status.
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate with existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Cross Connectivity

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `cross_connectivity` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it to monitor network connectivity.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `cross_connectivity` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cross_connectivity: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Platform-specific Configuration

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` includes the necessary permissions to access network state:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

#### iOS

For iOS, no additional configuration is required beyond the default setup.

### Step 3: Implementing the Package

Create a new Dart file, `real_flutter.dart`, and import the package:

```dart
import 'package:cross_connectivity/cross_connectivity.dart';
```

### Step 4: Using the RealFlutter Class

Create a class `RealFlutter` to encapsulate the connectivity logic:

```dart
class RealFlutter {
  final Connectivity _connectivity = Connectivity();

  Stream<ConnectivityResult> get connectivityStream => _connectivity.onConnectivityChanged;

  Future<ConnectivityResult> checkConnectivity() async {
    return await _connectivity.checkConnectivity();
  }
}
```

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `cross_connectivity` package to monitor network connectivity.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cross_connectivity/cross_connectivity.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cross Connectivity Demo',
      home: ConnectivityDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class ConnectivityDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ConnectivityDemoState createState() => _ConnectivityDemoState();
}

class _ConnectivityDemoState extends State<ConnectivityDemo> {
  final RealFlutter _realFlutter = RealFlutter();
  ConnectivityResult _connectivityResult = ConnectivityResult.none;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize connectivity monitoring
    _realFlutter.connectivityStream.listen((ConnectivityResult result) {
      // Update the connectivity status when it changes
      setState(() {
        _connectivityResult = result;
      });
    });
    // Check initial connectivity status
    _checkInitialConnectivity();
  }

  Future<void> _checkInitialConnectivity() async {
    // Get the current connectivity status
    ConnectivityResult result = await _realFlutter.checkConnectivity();
    setState(() {
      _connectivityResult = result;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Connectivity Status'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Current Connectivity: ${_connectivityResult.toString()}',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts by running the `MyApp` widget, which sets up a `MaterialApp` with a home page of `ConnectivityDemo`.
// The `ConnectivityDemo` widget is a stateful widget that monitors network connectivity using the `RealFlutter` class.
// In the `initState` method, the app listens to connectivity changes and updates the UI accordingly.
// The `_checkInitialConnectivity` method checks the connectivity status when the app starts and updates the state.
// The `build` method displays the current connectivity status in the center of the screen.
