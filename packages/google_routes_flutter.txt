# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Google Routes Flutter

## Installation
To get started with the `google_routes_flutter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_routes_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/google_routes_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

3. Ensure you have the Google Maps API key set up in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
    android:value="YOUR_API_KEY"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys for location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show routes.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show routes.</string>
```

3. Add your Google Maps API key:

```xml
<key>GMSApiKey</key>
<string>YOUR_API_KEY</string>
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement routing.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_routes_flutter/google_routes_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Google Routes Example',
      home: RouteScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class RouteScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RouteScreenState createState() => _RouteScreenState();
}

class _RouteScreenState extends State<RouteScreen> {
  // Define the start and end locations
  final LatLng startLocation = LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194); // San Francisco
  final LatLng endLocation = LatLng(34.0522, -118.2437); // Los Angeles

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Google Routes Example'),
      ),
      body: GoogleRoutes(
        start: startLocation,
        end: endLocation,
        // Optional: Customize the route appearance
        routeColor: Colors.blue,
        onRouteCreated: (route) {
          // Callback when the route is created
          print('Route created: $route');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The RouteScreen widget is created, which initializes start and end locations.
// 4. The GoogleRoutes widget is used to display the route on the map.
// 5. The route is drawn between the specified start and end locations, with a callback to handle route creation.
```

### Summary
In this blog post, we explored the `google_routes_flutter` package, detailing its features, installation process, and usage. We provided a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates how to visualize routes between two locations using Google Maps. The application flow was explained step-by-step through comments in the code, making it easy for developers to understand how to implement routing features in their own projects.
