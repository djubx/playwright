# Overview of the `group_radio_button` Flutter Package

The `group_radio_button` package is a powerful and flexible solution for implementing radio button groups in Flutter applications. It allows developers to create a set of radio buttons that can be grouped together, enabling users to select one option from a predefined list. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where a user needs to make a single choice from multiple options, such as selecting a payment method, choosing a subscription plan, or answering survey questions.

## Features
- **Customizable Appearance**: The package allows for extensive customization of the radio buttons, including colors, shapes, and sizes.
- **Easy Integration**: It can be easily integrated into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.
- **State Management**: The package provides built-in state management, making it easy to track the selected option.
- **Accessibility**: Supports accessibility features, ensuring that all users can interact with the radio buttons effectively.

## When to Use
You should consider using the `group_radio_button` package when:
- You need to present a list of mutually exclusive options to the user.
- You want to customize the appearance of radio buttons beyond the default Flutter styling.
- You require a simple and effective way to manage the state of selected options in your application.

```dart
import 'package:group_radio_button/group_radio_button.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
You can now use the `GroupRadioButton` widget in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it.

### Platform-Specific Details

# Complete Example of Using `group_radio_button`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:group_radio_button/group_radio_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Group Radio Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Group Radio Button Example'),
        ),
        body: RadioButtonDemo(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RadioButtonDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RadioButtonDemoState createState() => _RadioButtonDemoState();
}

class _RadioButtonDemoState extends State<RadioButtonDemo> {
  // Variable to hold the selected value
  String? selectedValue;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: <Widget>[
        // Displaying the group of radio buttons
        GroupRadioButton<String>(
          options: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
          onChanged: (value) {
            // Update the selected value when a radio button is pressed
            setState(() {
              selectedValue = value;
            });
          },
          selectedValue: selectedValue,
          // Customizing the appearance of the radio buttons
          activeColor: Colors.blue,
          // Adding a border radius to the buttons
          buttonShape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
          ),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        // Displaying the selected value
        Text(
          'Selected Value: ${selectedValue ?? "None"}',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds the MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body that displays the RadioButtonDemo widget.
// 4. The RadioButtonDemo widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected radio button.
// 5. Inside the build method, a GroupRadioButton is created with three options.
// 6. When a radio button is selected, the onChanged callback updates the selectedValue state.
// 7. The selected value is displayed below the radio buttons, updating dynamically as the user makes a selection.
