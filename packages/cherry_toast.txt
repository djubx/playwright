# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Cherry Toast

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **cherry_toast** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cherry_toast: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:cherry_toast/cherry_toast.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Cherry Toast

You can now use the **cherry_toast** package to display toast messages. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to show a success toast:

```dart
CherryToast.success(
  title: Text('Success!'),
  description: Text('Your action was successful.'),
).show(context);
```

### Customization Example

You can customize the toast further:

```dart
CherryToast.info(
  title: Text('Info'),
  description: Text('This is an informational message.'),
  icon: Icon(Icons.info, color: Colors.white),
  backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
  duration: Duration(seconds: 3),
).show(context);
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate and use the **cherry_toast** package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Cherry Toast

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cherry_toast/cherry_toast.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cherry Toast Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Cherry Toast Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a success toast when the button is pressed
            CherryToast.success(
              title: Text('Success!'),
              description: Text('Your action was successful.'),
              icon: Icon(Icons.check, color: Colors.white),
              backgroundColor: Colors.green,
              duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
            ).show(context);
          },
          child: Text('Show Success Toast'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, a success toast is displayed using CherryToast.
// 6. The toast shows a success message with an icon and a green background for 2 seconds.
```
