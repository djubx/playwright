# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using appflowy_editor

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `appflowy_editor` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `appflowy_editor` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  appflowy_editor: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/appflowy_editor).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if your app requires internet access or other features.

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add any necessary permissions, such as:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `appflowy_editor` in your app.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appflowy_editor/appflowy_editor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AppFlowy Editor Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: EditorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class EditorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EditorScreenState createState() => _EditorScreenState();
}

class _EditorScreenState extends State<EditorScreen> {
  // Create a controller for the editor
  final AppFlowyEditorController _controller = AppFlowyEditorController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('AppFlowy Editor'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // The AppFlowy editor widget
          Expanded(
            child: AppFlowyEditor(
              controller: _controller,
              // Customize the toolbar
              toolbar: AppFlowyToolbar(
                items: [
                  ToolbarItem.bold,
                  ToolbarItem.italic,
                  ToolbarItem.underline,
                  ToolbarItem.unorderedList,
                  ToolbarItem.orderedList,
                ],
              ),
            ),
          ),
          // Button to save the content
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Get the content from the editor
                final content = _controller.getContent();
                // Here you can save the content to a database or perform other actions
                print(content);
              },
              child: Text('Save Content'),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The EditorScreen widget is created, which contains the AppFlowy editor.
// 4. An AppFlowyEditorController is instantiated to manage the editor's state.
// 5. The AppFlowyEditor widget is displayed, with a customizable toolbar for text formatting options.
// 6. A button is provided to save the content, which retrieves the current content from the editor and prints it to the console.
// 7. This setup allows users to edit text with rich formatting and save their content as needed.
