# Unfocus Widget: A Flutter Package for Dismissing Focus

The `unfocus_widget` package is a simple yet powerful Flutter package designed to help developers manage focus in their applications. It provides a way to dismiss the keyboard or unfocus any currently focused widget when tapping outside of it. This is particularly useful in forms or input-heavy applications where users may want to dismiss the keyboard without having to tap a specific button.

## When to Use This Package
- **Forms**: When you have multiple input fields and want to allow users to dismiss the keyboard easily.
- **Custom UI**: In scenarios where you have custom widgets that require focus management.
- **User Experience**: To enhance user experience by preventing the keyboard from obstructing important UI elements.

## Features
- **Dismiss Keyboard**: Automatically dismisses the keyboard when tapping outside of a focused input field.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of the tap area and behavior.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, making it easy to integrate into existing projects.

Overall, `unfocus_widget` is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to improve focus management in their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Unfocus Widget

## Installation
To add the `unfocus_widget` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  unfocus_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Usage
To use the `unfocus_widget`, wrap your main widget with `UnfocusWidget`. This will allow the widget to listen for taps outside of focused fields.

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: No additional configuration is required.
- **iOS**: Ensure that your app's keyboard settings are configured correctly in the Xcode project settings.

### Example Setup
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `unfocus_widget` in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:unfocus_widget/unfocus_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: UnfocusWidget(
        child: RealFlutter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `UnfocusWidget` wraps the `RealFlutter` widget, allowing it to dismiss the keyboard when tapping outside of input fields.

# Complete Example of Unfocus Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:unfocus_widget/unfocus_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: UnfocusWidget(
        child: RealFlutter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Unfocus Widget Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your name'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your email'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Handle form submission
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Form Submitted')),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// Inside the MaterialApp, we wrap the RealFlutter widget with UnfocusWidget.
// This allows the keyboard to be dismissed when tapping outside of the TextFields.
// The RealFlutter widget contains a simple form with two TextFields and a Submit button.
// When the user taps the Submit button, a SnackBar is shown indicating the form submission.
```

### Summary of Application Flow
The application begins with the `MyApp` widget, which initializes the `MaterialApp`. The `UnfocusWidget` wraps the `RealFlutter` widget, enabling the keyboard to be dismissed when tapping outside of the text fields. The `RealFlutter` widget contains a simple form with two text fields for user input and a submit button. When the user taps the submit button, a SnackBar appears, confirming that the form has been submitted. This flow enhances user experience by allowing easy dismissal of the keyboard, making the app more intuitive and user-friendly.
