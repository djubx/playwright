# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_cached_video_player_plus

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_cached_video_player_plus`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_cached_video_player_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_cached_video_player_plus).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions to allow video playback:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to implement the `flutter_cached_video_player_plus` in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_cached_video_player_plus/flutter_cached_video_player_plus.dart';
```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage video playback:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late CachedVideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the controller with a video URL
    _controller = CachedVideoPlayerController.network(
      'https://www.example.com/video.mp4',
    )..initialize().then((_) {
        // Ensure the first frame is shown after the video is initialized
        setState(() {});
      });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cached Video Player')),
      body: Center(
        child: _controller.value.isInitialized
            ? AspectRatio(
                aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio,
                child: CachedVideoPlayer(_controller),
              )
            : CircularProgressIndicator(),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Play or pause the video based on its current state
          setState(() {
            _controller.value.isPlaying
                ? _controller.pause()
                : _controller.play();
          });
        },
        child: Icon(
          _controller.value.isPlaying ? Icons.pause : Icons.play_arrow,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic video player with caching capabilities. The video will be cached after the first play, allowing for faster subsequent loads.

# Complete Example of flutter_cached_video_player_plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_cached_video_player_plus/flutter_cached_video_player_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Cached Video Player',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late CachedVideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the CachedVideoPlayerController with a video URL
    _controller = CachedVideoPlayerController.network(
      'https://www.example.com/video.mp4',
    )..initialize().then((_) {
        // Update the UI once the video is initialized
        setState(() {});
      });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller to free up resources
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cached Video Player')),
      body: Center(
        child: _controller.value.isInitialized
            ? AspectRatio(
                aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio,
                child: CachedVideoPlayer(_controller),
              )
            : CircularProgressIndicator(), // Show loading indicator until video is initialized
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Toggle play/pause state of the video
          setState(() {
            _controller.value.isPlaying
                ? _controller.pause() // Pause the video if it's currently playing
                : _controller.play(); // Play the video if it's currently paused
          });
        },
        child: Icon(
          _controller.value.isPlaying ? Icons.pause : Icons.play_arrow, // Change icon based on play state
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a stateful widget that initializes a CachedVideoPlayerController with a video URL.
// 4. In initState, the controller is initialized, and the UI is updated once the video is ready to play.
// 5. The build method checks if the video is initialized; if so, it displays the video player; otherwise, it shows a loading indicator.
// 6. A FloatingActionButton is provided to toggle play and pause functionality for the video.
