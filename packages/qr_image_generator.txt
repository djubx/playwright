# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the QR Image Generator Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `qr_image_generator` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  qr_image_generator: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access the camera or other device features. However, for basic QR code generation, no special permissions are required.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to generate a QR code.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:qr_image_generator/qr_image_generator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('QR Code Generator'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: QrImage(
            data: 'https://www.example.com', // The data to encode
            version: QrVersions.auto, // Automatically determine the version
            size: 200.0, // Size of the QR code
            gapless: false, // Whether to have gaps between QR code modules
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a QR code linking to "https://www.example.com". The `QrImage` widget takes care of rendering the QR code based on the provided data.

# Complete Example of QR Image Generator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:qr_image_generator/qr_image_generator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('QR Code Generator'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: QrImage(
            data: 'https://www.example.com', // The data to encode in the QR code
            version: QrVersions.auto, // Automatically determine the QR code version
            size: 200.0, // Set the size of the QR code
            gapless: false, // Set to true if you want no gaps between modules
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "QR Code Generator".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a QrImage widget.
// 5. The QrImage widget generates a QR code based on the provided data (a URL in this case).
// 6. The QR code is displayed in the center of the screen with a specified size of 200x200 pixels.
// 7. The app is simple and demonstrates the basic functionality of generating a QR code using the qr_image_generator package.
