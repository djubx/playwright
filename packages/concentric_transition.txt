# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Concentric Transition Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **concentric_transition** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  concentric_transition: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the **concentric_transition** package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:concentric_transition/concentric_transition.dart';
```

You can then use the `ConcentricPageTransition` widget to wrap your pages. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ConcentricPageTransition(
  child: YourNextPage(),
  // Additional properties can be set here
);
```

This widget will handle the transition between your current page and the next page smoothly.

## Step 4: Customizing Transitions

You can customize the transition by adjusting properties such as `duration`, `curve`, and `colors`. Here’s an example:

```dart
ConcentricPageTransition(
  child: YourNextPage(),
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 600),
  curve: Curves.easeInOut,
  colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.red],
);
```

This customization allows you to create unique transitions that fit the theme of your application.

# Complete Example of Using Concentric Transition

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:concentric_transition/concentric_transition.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Concentric Transition Demo',
      home: FirstPage(),
    );
  }
}

class FirstPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('First Page')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the second page with a concentric transition
            Navigator.of(context).push(
              MaterialPageRoute(
                builder: (context) => ConcentricPageTransition(
                  child: SecondPage(),
                  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 600),
                  curve: Curves.easeInOut,
                  colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.red],
                ),
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Page'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Page')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate back to the first page
            Navigator.of(context).pop();
          },
          child: Text('Back to First Page'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The FirstPage widget is displayed, containing a button to navigate to the SecondPage.
// 3. When the button is pressed, a ConcentricPageTransition is initiated, transitioning to the SecondPage.
// 4. The SecondPage has a button to navigate back to the FirstPage, which pops the current route off the stack.
// 5. The transition effect enhances the user experience by providing a smooth visual transition between pages.
```
