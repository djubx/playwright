Here's a detailed technical blog on the "complete_timer" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Complete Timer Flutter Package

The **complete_timer** Flutter package is a versatile and easy-to-use timer utility that allows developers to implement countdown timers and stopwatches in their Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require time tracking, such as fitness apps, cooking apps, or any application where timing is crucial.

## Features
- **Countdown Timer**: Create timers that count down from a specified duration.
- **Stopwatch**: Implement a stopwatch that can start, stop, and reset.
- **Customizable UI**: Easily customize the appearance of the timer and stopwatch.
- **Notifications**: Optionally, send notifications when the timer ends.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

## When to Use
You might want to use the **complete_timer** package in scenarios such as:
- A cooking application that requires users to set timers for different recipes.
- A fitness app that tracks workout durations.
- A game that requires countdowns for turns or rounds.

The package simplifies the implementation of timers, allowing developers to focus on building the core functionality of their applications without worrying about the underlying timer logic.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Complete Timer Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **complete_timer** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  complete_timer: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if you plan to use notifications. Add the following inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your app to allow notifications. Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:complete_timer/complete_timer.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Timer
You can now create a timer or stopwatch in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the **complete_timer** package:

```dart
// Create a timer instance
final timer = CompleteTimer();
```

You can start, stop, and reset the timer using the methods provided by the package.

# Complete Example of Using the Complete Timer Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:complete_timer/complete_timer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Complete Timer Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: TimerPage(),
    );
  }
}

class TimerPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TimerPageState createState() => _TimerPageState();
}

class _TimerPageState extends State<TimerPage> {
  // Create a CompleteTimer instance
  final CompleteTimer _timer = CompleteTimer();
  bool _isRunning = false; // Track if the timer is running

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the timer with a duration of 60 seconds
    _timer.setDuration(Duration(seconds: 60));
  }

  void _startTimer() {
    // Start the timer
    setState(() {
      _isRunning = true;
    });
    _timer.start();
  }

  void _stopTimer() {
    // Stop the timer
    setState(() {
      _isRunning = false;
    });
    _timer.stop();
  }

  void _resetTimer() {
    // Reset the timer
    setState(() {
      _isRunning = false;
    });
    _timer.reset();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Complete Timer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the remaining time
            Text(
              'Time Remaining: ${_timer.remainingTime.inSeconds} seconds',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Start button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _isRunning ? null : _startTimer,
              child: Text('Start Timer'),
            ),
            // Stop button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: !_isRunning ? null : _stopTimer,
              child: Text('Stop Timer'),
            ),
            // Reset button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _resetTimer,
              child: Text('Reset Timer'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The TimerPage widget is created, which manages the timer state.
// 3. In the initState method, the timer is initialized with a duration of 60 seconds.
// 4. The UI displays the remaining time and buttons to start, stop, and reset the timer.
// 5. When the Start button is pressed, the timer starts counting down.
// 6. The Stop button pauses the timer, and the Reset button resets it back to the initial duration.
// 7. The UI updates dynamically based on the timer's state.
```
