## Setup Process

To get started with the `filepicker_windows` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  filepicker_windows: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/filepicker_windows).

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Windows Configuration

1. **Enable Windows Desktop Support**: Ensure that your Flutter environment is set up for Windows development. You can check this by running:
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

2. **Update `CMakeLists.txt`**: If you are using CMake, ensure that your `CMakeLists.txt` file includes the necessary configurations for the `filepicker_windows` package.

3. **Permissions**: Ensure that your application has the necessary permissions to access the file system. This is typically handled by default, but you may need to adjust settings in your Windows app manifest if you encounter issues.

### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:filepicker_windows/filepicker_windows.dart';
```

## Using the Package

To use the `filepicker_windows` package, you can create a function that opens the file picker dialog. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
void pickFile() async {
  // Create a FilePicker instance
  final result = await FilePicker.getFile();
  
  // Check if a file was selected
  if (result != null) {
    print('File selected: ${result.path}');
  } else {
    print('No file selected');
  }
}
```

This function opens a file picker dialog, allowing the user to select a file. If a file is selected, its path is printed to the console.

# Complete Example

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application using the `filepicker_windows` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:filepicker_windows/filepicker_windows.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'File Picker Example',
      home: FilePickerHome(),
    );
  }
}

class FilePickerHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('File Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            pickFile(); // Call the function to pick a file
          },
          child: Text('Pick a File'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void pickFile() async {
    // Create a FilePicker instance
    final result = await FilePicker.getFile();
    
    // Check if a file was selected
    if (result != null) {
      // If a file is selected, print its path
      print('File selected: ${result.path}');
    } else {
      // If no file is selected, print a message
      print('No file selected');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (FilePickerHome).
// 3. The FilePickerHome widget contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created. When pressed, it calls the pickFile() function.
// 5. The pickFile() function opens the file picker dialog. If a file is selected, its path is printed to the console; otherwise, a message indicating no selection is printed.
```
