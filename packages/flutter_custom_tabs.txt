  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_custom_tabs: ^0.6.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

```xml

    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

You can now use the `flutter_custom_tabs` package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to open a URL:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_custom_tabs/flutter_custom_tabs.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Custom Tabs Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              try {
                await launch(
                  'https://flutter.dev',
                  customTabsOptions: CustomTabsOptions(
                    toolbarColor: Colors.deepPurple,
                    showTitle: true,
                    enableUrlBarHiding: true,
                    enableDefaultShare: true,
                  ),
                );
              } catch (e) {
                print('Error launching URL: $e');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Open Flutter Website'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, it opens the Flutter website in a custom tab with a purple toolbar.

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(

        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(

              // Attempt to launch the URL
              try {
                await launch(
                  'https://flutter.dev', // URL to open
                  customTabsOptions: CustomTabsOptions(
                    toolbarColor: Colors.deepPurple, // Custom toolbar color
                    showTitle: true, // Show the title in the toolbar
                    enableUrlBarHiding: true, // Hide the URL bar
                    enableDefaultShare: true, // Enable default sharing options
                  ),
                );
              } catch (e) {
                // Print error if URL launch fails
                print('Error launching URL: $e');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Open Flutter Website'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the app structure.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout, including an AppBar and body.
// 4. In the body, a Center widget is used to center the ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 6. The launch function attempts to open the specified URL in a custom tab.
// 7. Custom options for the tab are provided, such as toolbar color and visibility settings.
// 8. If the URL launch fails, an error message is printed to the console.
