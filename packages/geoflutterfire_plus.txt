- Your application requires real-time updates based on user location.

### Features

- **Geolocation Queries**: Easily query Firestore for documents within a specified radius.
- **Real-time Updates**: Listen for changes in location data and update the UI accordingly.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Integration with Firestore**: Leverages Firestore's real-time capabilities for location data.

## Tutorial

### Setup Process

To get started with `geoflutterfire_plus`, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     geoflutterfire_plus: ^latest_version
     cloud_firestore: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/geoflutterfire_plus).

2. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:

   #### Android
   - Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
         }
     }
     ```

   - Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

     ```xml
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
     ```

   #### iOS
   - Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys for location permissions:

     ```xml
     <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
     <string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
     <key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
     <string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
     ```

3. **Initialize Firestore**: In your main Dart file, ensure Firestore is initialized:

   ```dart
   void main() async {
     WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
     await Firebase.initializeApp();
     runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```

### Using the Package

1. **Creating a GeoFirestore Instance**:

   ```dart
   final geo = GeoflutterfirePlus();
   ```

2. **Adding Geolocation Data**:

   To add a location to Firestore:

   ```dart
   final GeoFirePoint point = geo.point(latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194);
   await FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('locations').add({
     'position': point.data,
     'name': 'San Francisco',
   });
   ```

3. **Querying Nearby Locations**:

   To query locations within a certain radius:

   ```dart
   double radius = 10; // in kilometers
   String field = 'position';
   var collectionReference = FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('locations');

   geo.collection(collectionRef: collectionReference)
       .within(center: point, radius: radius, field: field)
       .listen((List<DocumentSnapshot> documentList) {
         // Handle the list of documents
       });
   ```

This setup allows you to efficiently manage and query geolocation data in your Flutter application.

## Complete Example

Hereâ€™s a complete example of a Flutter application using `geoflutterfire_plus`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';
import 'package:geoflutterfire_plus/geoflutterfire_plus.dart';
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp(); // Initialize Firebase
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Geoflutterfire Plus Example',
      home: LocationScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class LocationScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LocationScreenState createState() => _LocationScreenState();
}

class _LocationScreenState extends State<LocationScreen> {
  final geo = GeoflutterfirePlus(); // Create an instance of GeoflutterfirePlus
  final FirebaseFirestore firestore = FirebaseFirestore.instance; // Firestore instance
  List<DocumentSnapshot> nearbyLocations = []; // List to hold nearby locations

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _addLocation(); // Add a location to Firestore
    _getNearbyLocations(); // Fetch nearby locations
  }

  // Function to add a location to Firestore
  void _addLocation() async {
    final GeoFirePoint point = geo.point(latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194); // Create a GeoFirePoint
    await firestore.collection('locations').add({
      'position': point.data, // Store the position
      'name': 'San Francisco', // Store the name
    });
  }

  // Function to get nearby locations
  void _getNearbyLocations() {
    final GeoFirePoint center = geo.point(latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194); // Center point
    double radius = 10; // Radius in kilometers
    String field = 'position'; // Field name for position

    geo.collection(collectionRef: firestore.collection('locations'))
        .within(center: center, radius: radius, field: field)
        .listen((List<DocumentSnapshot> documentList) {
          setState(() {
            nearbyLocations = documentList; // Update the state with nearby locations
          });
        });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Nearby Locations')),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: nearbyLocations.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          var location = nearbyLocations[index];
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(location['name']), // Display the name of the location
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app initializes Firebase and sets up the main widget.
// 2. The LocationScreen widget is created, which manages the state of nearby locations.
// 3. In the initState method, a location is added to Firestore, and nearby locations are fetched.
// 4. The _addLocation method creates a GeoFirePoint for San Francisco and adds it to Firestore.
// 5. The _getNearbyLocations method queries Firestore for locations within a 10 km radius of the center point.
// 6. The ListView displays the names of the nearby locations in real-time as they are fetched.
```
