# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the app_tutorial Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `app_tutorial` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  app_tutorial: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:app_tutorial/app_tutorial.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup
You need to initialize the tutorial in your main application file. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` has the necessary permissions if your tutorial requires internet access or other features.

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, make sure to set the appropriate permissions in your `Info.plist` file if needed.

## Step 4: Creating a Tutorial
You can create a tutorial by defining a list of tutorial steps. Each step can include a title, description, and an optional image.

```dart
List<TutorialStep> steps = [
  TutorialStep(
    title: 'Welcome to RealFlutter',
    description: 'This is an introduction to our app.',
    image: 'assets/welcome.png',
  ),
  TutorialStep(
    title: 'Feature 1',
    description: 'Here is how you use Feature 1.',
    image: 'assets/feature1.png',
  ),
  // Add more steps as needed
];
```

## Step 5: Displaying the Tutorial
To display the tutorial, wrap your main widget with the `AppTutorial` widget and pass the steps:

```dart
AppTutorial(
  steps: steps,
  child: MyApp(), // Your main application widget
);
```

## Step 6: Customizing the Tutorial
You can customize the appearance and behavior of the tutorial by passing additional parameters to the `AppTutorial` widget, such as colors, fonts, and navigation styles.

With these steps, you can effectively integrate the `app_tutorial` package into your Flutter application, providing a seamless onboarding experience for your users.

# Complete Example of Using the app_tutorial Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_tutorial/app_tutorial.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define the tutorial steps
    List<TutorialStep> steps = [
      TutorialStep(
        title: 'Welcome to RealFlutter',
        description: 'This is an introduction to our app.',
        image: 'assets/welcome.png',
      ),
      TutorialStep(
        title: 'Feature 1',
        description: 'Here is how you use Feature 1.',
        image: 'assets/feature1.png',
      ),
      // Additional steps can be added here
    ];

    // Wrap the main app with AppTutorial
    return AppTutorial(
      steps: steps,
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'RealFlutter App',
        theme: ThemeData(
          primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        ),
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the RealFlutter App!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the app and defines the tutorial steps.
// 3. The AppTutorial widget wraps the MaterialApp, allowing the tutorial to be displayed.
// 4. The HomeScreen widget is set as the home of the MaterialApp, displaying a welcome message.
// 5. Users can navigate through the tutorial steps before accessing the main app features.
