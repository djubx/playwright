// Summary:
// The code flows by first running the `main` function, which calls the `runApp` function with the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget builds the app's UI using the `build` method, which returns a `MaterialApp` widget with a `Scaffold` widget as its child.
// The `Scaffold` widget contains an `AppBar` widget and a `Center` widget, which contains a `Column` widget with several children.
// Each child is an `Icon` widget or a `Text` widget, which use icons from different icon packs.
