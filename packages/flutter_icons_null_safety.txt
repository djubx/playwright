  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Flutter Icons Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, three Icon widgets are displayed: home, settings, and user icons.
// 6. Each icon is customized with size and color, and SizedBox is used to add spacing between them.
// 7. The app showcases how to use the flutter_icons_null_safety package to display various icons.
