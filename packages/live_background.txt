# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Live Background Package

## Installation
To get started with the `live_background` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  live_background: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow background processing:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `live_background` package, you can create a simple widget that utilizes the `LiveBackground` class. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:live_background/live_background.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: LiveBackground(
        // Set your background image or animation here
        image: AssetImage('assets/background.png'),
        child: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Welcome to Live Background!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple live background with a centered text widget. You can customize the `LiveBackground` widget further to suit your design needs.

# Complete Example of Live Background in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:live_background/live_background.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Live Background Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: LiveBackground(
        // Setting the background image for the live background
        image: AssetImage('assets/background.png'),
        child: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text(
                'Welcome to Live Background!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action when button is pressed
                  print('Button Pressed!');
                },
                child: Text('Press Me'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with a LiveBackground widget.
// 4. The LiveBackground widget takes an AssetImage for the background and displays a centered column.
// 5. The column contains a welcome text and a button.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it prints a message to the console.
```
