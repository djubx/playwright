# Setting Up and Using Sizer Pro
================================

### Step 1: Add Sizer Pro to Your Flutter Project

To use Sizer Pro in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. You can do this by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  sizer_pro: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import Sizer Pro

To use Sizer Pro in your Flutter app, you need to import it in your Dart file. You can do this by adding the following line to your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:sizer_pro/sizer_pro.dart';
```
### Step 3: Use Sizer Pro to Handle Screen Sizes and Orientations

To use Sizer Pro to handle screen sizes and orientations, you can use the `SizerPro` class. Here is an example:
```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SizerPro(
      builder: (context, orientation) {
        // Handle screen size and orientation here
        return Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: Text('Sizer Pro Example'),
          ),
          body: Center(
            child: Text('Hello, World!'),
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```
In this example, the `SizerPro` class is used to handle the screen size and orientation. The `builder` property is used to define a callback function that is called when the screen size or orientation changes.

### Platform-Specific Details

Sizer Pro is compatible with both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details to keep in mind:

* On Android, Sizer Pro uses the `android.view.Display` class to get the screen size and orientation.
* On iOS, Sizer Pro uses the `UIScreen` class to get the screen size and orientation.

### Required Configurations and Optimizations

To use Sizer Pro, you need to configure your Flutter project to use the `SizerPro` class. You can do this by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  sizer_pro: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sizer_pro/sizer_pro.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sizer Pro Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Use SizerPro to handle screen size and orientation
    return SizerPro(
      builder: (context, orientation) {
        // Handle screen size and orientation here
        return Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: Text('Sizer Pro Example'),
          ),
          body: Center(
            child: Text('Hello, World!'),
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app.
// 2. The app uses SizerPro to handle the screen size and orientation.
// 3. The SizerPro class calls the builder callback function to handle the screen size and orientation.
// 4. The builder callback function returns a Scaffold widget with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains a Text widget with the text 'Hello, World!'.
// 6. The app displays the Scaffold widget with the AppBar and the Center widget.
// 7. The user can interact with the app by rotating the screen or changing the screen size.
// 8. The SizerPro class handles the screen size and orientation changes and updates the app UI accordingly.

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// 1. The app uses SizerPro to handle the screen size and orientation.
// 2. The SizerPro class calls the builder callback function to handle the screen size and orientation.
// 3. The builder callback function returns a Scaffold widget with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The app displays the Scaffold widget with the AppBar and the Center widget.
// 5. The SizerPro class handles the screen size and orientation changes and updates the app UI accordingly.
