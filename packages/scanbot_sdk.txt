<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Scanbot SDK Flutter Package

The **Scanbot SDK** is a powerful Flutter package that provides developers with the ability to integrate advanced document scanning and image processing capabilities into their applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require scanning documents, receipts, or barcodes, and it offers a range of features that enhance the user experience.

## When to Use Scanbot SDK

You should consider using the Scanbot SDK in scenarios such as:
- **Document Management Apps**: If you're building an app that requires users to scan and manage documents, the Scanbot SDK can streamline this process.
- **Expense Tracking**: For apps that help users track expenses by scanning receipts, this package provides the necessary tools to capture and process images effectively.
- **Barcode Scanning**: If your application needs to scan barcodes or QR codes, the Scanbot SDK offers robust support for these features.

## Key Features
- **Document Scanning**: Capture high-quality scans of documents with automatic edge detection and perspective correction.
- **Barcode Scanning**: Support for various barcode formats, including QR codes, UPC, and EAN.
- **Image Processing**: Advanced image processing capabilities, including filters and enhancements.
- **Customizable UI**: The SDK allows for a customizable user interface to match your app's design.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, the Scanbot SDK is a versatile tool for developers looking to enhance their applications with scanning capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Scanbot SDK

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Scanbot SDK in a Flutter application, including platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the Scanbot SDK package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scanbot_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/scanbot_sdk).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. **Enable ProGuard**: If you are using ProGuard, make sure to add the following rules to your `proguard-rules.pro` file:

```pro
-keep class com.scanbot.sdk.** { *; }
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to scan documents.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save scanned documents.</string>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed and run:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

## Step 3: Using the Scanbot SDK

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple Flutter application that utilizes the Scanbot SDK.

### Basic Usage Example

In your Flutter app, you can use the following code to initialize and use the Scanbot SDK:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scanbot_sdk/scanbot_sdk.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scanbot SDK Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Scanbot SDK Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize the Scanbot SDK
              final scanbotSdk = ScanbotSdk();
              await scanbotSdk.initialize();

              // Start the document scanner
              final scannedDocument = await scanbotSdk.startDocumentScanner();

              // Check if a document was scanned
              if (scannedDocument != null) {
                // Handle the scanned document (e.g., save or display)
                print('Document scanned: ${scannedDocument.path}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Scan Document'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

# Complete Example of Scanbot SDK in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scanbot_sdk/scanbot_sdk.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scanbot SDK Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Scanbot SDK Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize the Scanbot SDK
              final scanbotSdk = ScanbotSdk();
              await scanbotSdk.initialize();

              // Start the document scanner
              final scannedDocument = await scanbotSdk.startDocumentScanner();

              // Check if a document was scanned
              if (scannedDocument != null) {
                // Handle the scanned document (e.g., save or display)
                print('Document scanned: ${scannedDocument.path}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Scan Document'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the Scanbot SDK is initialized.
// 5. The document scanner is launched, allowing the user to scan a document.
// 6. If a document is successfully scanned, its path is printed to the console.
// 7. This simple flow demonstrates how to integrate the Scanbot SDK into a Flutter application.
```
