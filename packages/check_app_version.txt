# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Check App Version Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `check_app_version` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  check_app_version: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions added:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the version check in your app.

# Complete Example of Using Check App Version

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:check_app_version/check_app_version.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Check App Version Example',
      home: VersionCheckScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VersionCheckScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VersionCheckScreenState createState() => _VersionCheckScreenState();
}

class _VersionCheckScreenState extends State<VersionCheckScreen> {
  String _currentVersion = 'Unknown';
  String _latestVersion = 'Unknown';
  bool _isUpdateAvailable = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _checkAppVersion(); // Call the version check on initialization
  }

  Future<void> _checkAppVersion() async {
    // Get the current app version
    _currentVersion = await CheckAppVersion.getCurrentVersion();
    
    // Get the latest version from the app store
    _latestVersion = await CheckAppVersion.getLatestVersion();

    // Compare versions and set the update availability
    setState(() {
      _isUpdateAvailable = _currentVersion != _latestVersion;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Version Check Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Current Version: $_currentVersion'),
            Text('Latest Version: $_latestVersion'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            if (_isUpdateAvailable)
              Text(
                'An update is available!',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.red, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              )
            else
              Text('You are using the latest version!'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The VersionCheckScreen widget is created, which manages the state of the version check.
// 4. In the initState method, the _checkAppVersion function is called to fetch the current and latest app versions.
// 5. The _checkAppVersion function retrieves the current version using CheckAppVersion.getCurrentVersion() and the latest version using CheckAppVersion.getLatestVersion().
// 6. The state is updated based on whether the current version matches the latest version.
// 7. The UI displays the current and latest versions, along with a message indicating if an update is available or if the user is on the latest version.
```
