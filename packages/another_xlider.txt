<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Another Xlider Flutter Package

The **another_xlider** package is a powerful and flexible slider widget for Flutter applications. It allows developers to create customizable sliders that can be used for a variety of purposes, such as selecting a range of values, adjusting settings, or navigating through content. This package is particularly useful in applications that require user input for numerical values, such as volume controls, brightness settings, or any scenario where a range selection is needed.

## Features
- **Customizable Appearance**: The package allows for extensive customization of the slider's appearance, including colors, shapes, and sizes.
- **Range Selection**: Users can select a range of values, making it suitable for applications that require minimum and maximum values.
- **Continuous and Discrete Values**: The slider can be configured to support both continuous and discrete value selections.
- **Callbacks**: The package provides callback functions that can be triggered on value changes, allowing for dynamic updates in the UI.

## When to Use
You should consider using the **another_xlider** package when:
- You need a slider that requires customization beyond the default Flutter slider.
- Your application involves selecting a range of values, such as price ranges in e-commerce apps.
- You want to provide a more interactive and visually appealing user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Another Xlider

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **another_xlider** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  another_xlider: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:another_xlider/another_xlider.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Slider
You can now use the slider in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AnotherSlider(
  min: 0,
  max: 100,
  divisions: 10,
  onChanged: (value) {
    print("Selected value: $value");
  },
)
```

This code creates a slider that allows users to select a value between 0 and 100, with 10 discrete divisions.

## Step 5: Customizing the Slider
You can customize the slider's appearance by modifying its properties:

```dart
AnotherSlider(
  min: 0,
  max: 100,
  divisions: 10,
  activeColor: Colors.blue,
  inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
  onChanged: (value) {
    print("Selected value: $value");
  },
)
```

This example changes the active color of the slider to blue and the inactive color to grey.

# Complete Example of Another Xlider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:another_xlider/another_xlider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Another Xlider Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Another Xlider Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SliderWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SliderWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SliderWidgetState createState() => _SliderWidgetState();
}

class _SliderWidgetState extends State<SliderWidget> {
  double _currentValue = 50; // Initial value for the slider

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the current value of the slider
        Text(
          'Selected Value: ${_currentValue.toStringAsFixed(1)}',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space between the text and the slider
        AnotherSlider(
          min: 0, // Minimum value of the slider
          max: 100, // Maximum value of the slider
          divisions: 10, // Number of discrete divisions
          activeColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the active part of the slider
          inactiveColor: Colors.grey, // Color of the inactive part of the slider
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              _currentValue = value; // Update the current value when the slider changes
            });
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body contains a SliderWidget, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. SliderWidget maintains the current value of the slider in its state.
// 5. The build method of SliderWidget displays the current value and the AnotherSlider widget.
// 6. When the slider is moved, the onChanged callback updates the current value and rebuilds the widget to reflect the change.
```
