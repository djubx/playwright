# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_simple_treeview

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_simple_treeview` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_simple_treeview` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_simple_treeview: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a tree view.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_simple_treeview/flutter_simple_treeview.dart';
```

2. Create a simple tree structure and display it using the `TreeView` widget.

# Complete Example of flutter_simple_treeview

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_simple_treeview/flutter_simple_treeview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Simple TreeView Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('TreeView Example'),
        ),
        body: TreeViewExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class TreeViewExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TreeViewExampleState createState() => _TreeViewExampleState();
}

class _TreeViewExampleState extends State<TreeViewExample> {
  // Define a list of nodes for the tree view
  final List<Node> nodes = [
    Node(
      content: Text('Root Node 1'),
      children: [
        Node(content: Text('Child Node 1.1')),
        Node(content: Text('Child Node 1.2')),
      ],
    ),
    Node(
      content: Text('Root Node 2'),
      children: [
        Node(content: Text('Child Node 2.1')),
        Node(content: Text('Child Node 2.2')),
      ],
    ),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return TreeView(
      nodes: nodes,
      // Set the initial expanded state of the tree
      onNodeTap: (node) {
        // Handle node tap event
        setState(() {
          node.isExpanded = !node.isExpanded; // Toggle the expanded state
        });
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the TreeViewExample widget.
// 3. TreeViewExample is a StatefulWidget that maintains a list of nodes representing the tree structure.
// 4. The build method of TreeViewExample creates a TreeView widget, passing the list of nodes.
// 5. When a node is tapped, the onNodeTap callback toggles the expanded state of the node, allowing users to expand or collapse it.
// 6. The TreeView widget automatically updates to reflect the changes in the node states.
```
