# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_native_text_input

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_native_text_input` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_native_text_input` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_native_text_input: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_text_input).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for text input features.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the microphone for voice input features.</string>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_native_text_input/flutter_native_text_input.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `flutter_native_text_input` package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a native text input field.

# Complete Example of flutter_native_text_input

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_native_text_input/flutter_native_text_input.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Native Text Input Example',
      home: NativeTextInputDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class NativeTextInputDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NativeTextInputDemoState createState() => _NativeTextInputDemoState();
}

class _NativeTextInputDemoState extends State<NativeTextInputDemo> {
  // Controller for the native text input
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Native Text Input Demo'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Native text input field
            NativeTextInput(
              controller: _controller,
              placeholder: 'Type something...',
              onChanged: (text) {
                // Handle text changes
                print('Text changed: $text');
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Print the current text input value
                print('Current input: ${_controller.text}');
              },
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget NativeTextInputDemo.
// 3. NativeTextInputDemo is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the text input.
// 4. A TextEditingController is created to manage the text input.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing a NativeTextInput and a button.
// 6. The NativeTextInput widget is used to create a native text input field, with a placeholder and an onChanged callback.
// 7. When the button is pressed, the current text input value is printed to the console.
```
