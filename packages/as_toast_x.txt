# Setting Up and Using the as_toast_x Package

## Installation
To use the `as_toast_x` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  as_toast_x: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/as_toast_x).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, no additional configuration is typically required. Just ensure that your project is set up to support the latest iOS versions.

## Basic Usage
To display a toast message, you can use the `showToast` method provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:as_toast_x/as_toast_x.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Toast Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show a toast message when the button is pressed
              showToast('Hello, this is a toast message!');
            },
            child: Text('Show Toast'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a toast message will appear at the bottom of the screen.

# Complete Example of as_toast_x in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:as_toast_x/as_toast_x.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Toast Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show a toast message when the button is pressed
              showToast(
                'Hello, this is a toast message!',
                duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the toast
                backgroundColor: Colors.blue, // Background color of the toast
                textColor: Colors.white, // Text color of the toast
                position: ToastPosition.bottom, // Position of the toast
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Toast'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the showToast function is called with a message and customization options.
// 5. The toast message appears at the bottom of the screen for the specified duration, providing feedback to the user.
