# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Weekly Date Picker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `weekly_date_picker` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  weekly_date_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include any necessary permissions, especially if your app interacts with the calendar or notifications.

## Step 3: Using the Weekly Date Picker
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `WeeklyDatePicker` in your app.

# Complete Example of Weekly Date Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:weekly_date_picker/weekly_date_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Weekly Date Picker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: WeeklyDatePickerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class WeeklyDatePickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WeeklyDatePickerDemoState createState() => _WeeklyDatePickerDemoState();
}

class _WeeklyDatePickerDemoState extends State<WeeklyDatePickerDemo> {
  DateTime selectedDate = DateTime.now(); // Initialize with the current date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Weekly Date Picker Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Selected Date: ${selectedDate.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0], // Display the selected date
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Show the weekly date picker when the button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (BuildContext context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Select a Date'),
                      content: WeeklyDatePicker(
                        initialDate: selectedDate, // Set the initial date
                        onDateChanged: (DateTime newDate) {
                          setState(() {
                            selectedDate = newDate; // Update the selected date
                          });
                          Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                        },
                      ),
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Pick a Date'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the weekly_date_picker package.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The WeeklyDatePickerDemo widget is a stateful widget that manages the selected date.
// 4. The selectedDate variable holds the currently selected date, initialized to the current date.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing:
//    - A Text widget displaying the selected date.
//    - An ElevatedButton that, when pressed, opens a dialog with the WeeklyDatePicker.
// 6. The WeeklyDatePicker is initialized with the current selected date and an onDateChanged callback.
// 7. When a new date is selected, the state is updated, and the dialog is closed, reflecting the new date in the UI.
