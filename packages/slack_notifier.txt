# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Slack Notifier Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **slack_notifier** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  slack_notifier: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configuring for Android
For Android, you need to ensure that your app has internet permissions. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

## Step 3: Configuring for iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in the `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`. Add the following lines to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that you have configured your project, you can start using the **slack_notifier** package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to send a notification:

```dart
import 'package:slack_notifier/slack_notifier.dart';

void sendSlackNotification() {
  final notifier = SlackNotifier(
    webhookUrl: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url',
  );

  notifier.send(
    text: 'Hello from Flutter!',
    channel: '#general',
  ).then((response) {
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      print('Notification sent successfully!');
    } else {
      print('Failed to send notification: ${response.body}');
    }
  });
}
```

In this example, replace `'https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url'` with your actual Slack webhook URL.

## Conclusion
With these steps, you can easily integrate the **slack_notifier** package into your Flutter application and start sending notifications to Slack. Make sure to handle any errors appropriately to ensure a smooth user experience.

# Complete Example of Using Slack Notifier in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:slack_notifier/slack_notifier.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Slack Notifier Example',
      home: SlackNotifierHome(),
    );
  }
}

class SlackNotifierHome extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create an instance of SlackNotifier with your webhook URL
  final SlackNotifier notifier = SlackNotifier(
    webhookUrl: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url',
  );

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Slack Notifier Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Call the function to send a notification when the button is pressed
            sendSlackNotification();
          },
          child: Text('Send Notification'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void sendSlackNotification() {
    // Send a notification to the specified Slack channel
    notifier.send(
      text: 'Hello from Flutter!',
      channel: '#general',
    ).then((response) {
      // Check the response status code
      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        // If successful, print a success message
        print('Notification sent successfully!');
      } else {
        // If failed, print the error message
        print('Failed to send notification: ${response.body}');
      }
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget, SlackNotifierHome.
// 3. SlackNotifierHome contains a button that, when pressed, triggers the sendSlackNotification() method.
// 4. The sendSlackNotification() method creates a SlackNotifier instance with the webhook URL.
// 5. It sends a message to the specified Slack channel and checks the response.
// 6. If the notification is sent successfully, a success message is printed; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
```
