Here's a detailed technical blog on the "themed" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Themed Flutter Package

The **themed** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of applying consistent theming across your Flutter applications. It allows developers to define a set of themes that can be easily switched or applied based on user preferences or application states. This package is particularly useful in applications that require dynamic theming, such as those that support light and dark modes or different color schemes for various sections of the app.

## When to Use This Package

- **Dynamic Theming**: When your application needs to support multiple themes that can be switched at runtime.
- **User Preferences**: If you want to allow users to customize the look and feel of your app based on their preferences.
- **Consistent UI**: To maintain a consistent design language across different screens and components of your application.

## Features

- **Easy Theme Management**: Define multiple themes in a single place and switch between them effortlessly.
- **Customizable**: Extend the default themes with your own colors, fonts, and styles.
- **Responsive**: Automatically adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Light and Dark Modes**: Built-in support for light and dark themes, making it easy to create a visually appealing app.

By leveraging the **themed** package, developers can enhance the user experience by providing a visually cohesive and customizable interface.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Themed Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **themed** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **themed** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  themed: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Configuring for Android and iOS

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to support dark mode:

```xml
<key>UIUserInterfaceStyle</key>
<string>Automatic</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Themed Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:themed/themed.dart';
```

2. Create a `RealFlutter` class that extends `StatelessWidget` and define your themes:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Themed(
      data: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        brightness: Brightness.light,
      ),
      darkData: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        brightness: Brightness.dark,
      ),
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Themed Flutter App',
        theme: Theme.of(context),
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Create a simple `HomeScreen` widget that utilizes the themes:

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Themed Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Toggle between light and dark themes
            Themed.of(context).toggle();
          },
          child: Text('Toggle Theme'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

4. Finally, run your application:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

This setup allows you to switch between light and dark themes by pressing the button in the `HomeScreen`.

# Complete Example: Themed Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:themed/themed.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The RealFlutter class is the main widget of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Themed widget wraps the MaterialApp to provide theming capabilities
    return Themed(
      data: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue, // Light theme primary color
        brightness: Brightness.light, // Light theme
      ),
      darkData: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue, // Dark theme primary color
        brightness: Brightness.dark, // Dark theme
      ),
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Themed Flutter App', // Title of the application
        theme: Theme.of(context), // Apply the current theme
        home: HomeScreen(), // Set the home screen
      ),
    );
  }
}

// HomeScreen widget displays the main content of the app
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Themed Flutter Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Toggle between light and dark themes when the button is pressed
            Themed.of(context).toggle();
          },
          child: Text('Toggle Theme'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a Themed widget that provides light and dark themes.
// 3. The MaterialApp is created with the current theme and sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 4. HomeScreen displays a button that toggles the theme when pressed, allowing users to switch between light and dark modes.
```
