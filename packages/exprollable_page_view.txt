# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Exprollable Page View

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **exprollable_page_view** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  exprollable_page_view: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:exprollable_page_view/exprollable_page_view.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Exprollable Page View

You can now use the `ExprollablePageView` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:exprollable_page_view/exprollable_page_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Exprollable Page View Example')),
        body: ExprollablePageView(
          children: [
            Container(color: Colors.red, child: Center(child: Text('Page 1'))),
            Container(color: Colors.green, child: Center(child: Text('Page 2'))),
            Container(color: Colors.blue, child: Center(child: Text('Page 3'))),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with three pages, each with a different background color. The `ExprollablePageView` widget allows users to swipe between these pages.

# Complete Example of Exprollable Page View

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:exprollable_page_view/exprollable_page_view.dart';

// Main application class
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Exprollable Page View Example')),
        body: ExprollablePageView(
          // List of pages to display
          children: [
            // Page 1
            Container(
              color: Colors.red,
              child: Center(child: Text('Page 1', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white))),
            ),
            // Page 2
            Container(
              color: Colors.green,
              child: Center(child: Text('Page 2', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white))),
            ),
            // Page 3
            Container(
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(child: Text('Page 3', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white))),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class is instantiated, which builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains the ExprollablePageView widget, which takes a list of children.
// 5. Each child is a Container with a different background color and centered text.
// 6. Users can swipe left or right to navigate between the pages, thanks to the ExprollablePageView's gesture support.
```
