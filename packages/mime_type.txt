# mime_type Flutter Package
==========================

The `mime_type` Flutter package is a utility library that helps you determine the MIME type of a file. MIME types are used to identify the type of data that a file contains, and they are essential for many applications, such as file sharing, uploading, and downloading.

## When to Use This Package
---------------------------

You should use this package when you need to determine the MIME type of a file in your Flutter application. This can be useful in a variety of scenarios, such as:

* When uploading files to a server, you need to specify the MIME type of the file.
* When sharing files with other applications, you need to specify the MIME type of the file.
* When displaying files in your application, you need to determine the MIME type of the file to display it correctly.

## Features
------------

The `mime_type` package provides the following features:

* Determines the MIME type of a file based on its extension.
* Supports a wide range of file extensions and MIME types.
* Easy to use and integrate into your Flutter application.

# Tutorial
==========

## Setup
--------

To use the `mime_type` package in your Flutter application, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Here's how to do it:

```yml
dependencies:
  mime_type: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to get the package.

## Usage
-----

To use the `mime_type` package, you need to import it into your Dart file. Here's how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:mime_type/mime_type.dart';
```

Then, you can use the `lookupMimeType` function to determine the MIME type of a file. Here's an example:

```dart
void main() {
  String mimeType = lookupMimeType('example.txt');
  print(mimeType); // prints text/plain
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details
---------------------------

The `mime_type` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details that you need to be aware of:

* On Android, the `mime_type` package uses the `android.webkit.MimeTypeMap` class to determine the MIME type of a file.
* On iOS, the `mime_type` package uses the `UTType` framework to determine the MIME type of a file.

```dart
// Import the mime_type package
import 'package:mime_type/mime_type.dart';

// Define the RealFlutter class
class RealFlutter {
  // Define the main function
  void main() {
    // Define a list of file paths
    List<String> filePaths = [
      'example.txt',
      'example.pdf',
      'example.jpg',
      'example.mp3',
    ];

    // Iterate over the file paths
    filePaths.forEach((filePath) {
      // Determine the MIME type of the file
      String mimeType = lookupMimeType(filePath);

      // Print the MIME type
      print('MIME type of $filePath: $mimeType');
    });
  }
}

// Create an instance of the RealFlutter class
RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();

// Call the main function
realFlutter.main();

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The main function is called.
// 2. A list of file paths is defined.
// 3. The list of file paths is iterated over.
// 4. For each file path, the MIME type is determined using the lookupMimeType function.
// 5. The MIME type is printed to the console.
// 6. The process is repeated for each file path in the list.

// Final summary: The code determines the MIME type of a list of files and prints the results to the console.
