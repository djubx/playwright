# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Document Scanner Plus

## Installation
To get started with `document_scanner_plus`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  document_scanner_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/document_scanner_plus).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request camera and photo library access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera to scan documents.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the photo library to save scanned documents.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `document_scanner_plus` package, you can create a simple UI that allows users to initiate the scanning process. Below is a basic example of how to implement this.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:document_scanner_plus/document_scanner_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Document Scanner Plus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Start the document scanning process
              final scannedDocuments = await DocumentScannerPlus.scanDocument();
              // Handle the scanned documents (e.g., display or save)
            },
            child: Text('Scan Document'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the user taps the "Scan Document" button, the scanning process begins, and the scanned documents can be handled as needed.

              final scannedDocuments = await DocumentScannerPlus.scanDocument();
              
              // Check if any documents were scanned
              if (scannedDocuments != null && scannedDocuments.isNotEmpty) {

                      content: SingleChildScrollView(
                        child: Column(
                          children: scannedDocuments.map((doc) {
                            return Image.file(doc); // Display each scanned document
                          }).toList(),
                        ),
                      ),
                      actions: [
                        TextButton(
                          onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                          child: Text('Close'),
                        ),
                      ],
                    );
                  },
                );
              } else {
                // Handle the case where no documents were scanned
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('No documents scanned.')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Scan Document'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget builds a simple UI with an AppBar and a centered button.
// When the button is pressed, it triggers the document scanning process using `DocumentScannerPlus.scanDocument()`.
// If documents are successfully scanned, they are displayed in an AlertDialog as images.
// If no documents are scanned, a SnackBar message informs the user.
// This flow provides a straightforward way for users to scan and view documents within the app.
