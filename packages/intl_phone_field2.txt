3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for internet access if you plan to use features that require network connectivity.
   - **iOS**: Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following key to allow the app to access the internet:

     ```xml
     <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
     <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
     </dict>
     ```

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:intl_phone_field2/intl_phone_field2.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

To use the `intl_phone_field2` package, you can create a simple form with a phone number input field. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:intl_phone_field2/intl_phone_field2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Phone Number Input')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: PhoneInputForm(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PhoneInputForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PhoneInputFormState createState() => _PhoneInputFormState();
}

class _PhoneInputFormState extends State<PhoneInputForm> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        IntlPhoneField(
          controller: _controller,
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            labelText: 'Phone Number',
            border: OutlineInputBorder(),
          ),
          initialCountryCode: 'US', // Set default country code
          onChanged: (phone) {
            print(phone.completeNumber); // Get the complete phone number
          },
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Handle form submission
            print('Submitted Phone Number: ${_controller.text}');
          },
          child: Text('Submit'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a phone number input field. The `IntlPhoneField` widget is used to create the input field, and it automatically handles country code selection and formatting.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:intl_phone_field2/intl_phone_field2.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Phone Number Input')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: PhoneInputForm(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PhoneInputForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PhoneInputFormState createState() => _PhoneInputFormState();
}

class _PhoneInputFormState extends State<PhoneInputForm> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController(); // Controller for the phone number input

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        // Phone number input field
        IntlPhoneField(
          controller: _controller, // Assigning the controller
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            labelText: 'Phone Number', // Label for the input field
            border: OutlineInputBorder(), // Styling the input field
          ),
          initialCountryCode: 'US', // Default country code
          onChanged: (phone) {
            // Callback when the phone number changes
            print(phone.completeNumber); // Print the complete phone number
          },
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Spacing between input and button
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action when the button is pressed
            print('Submitted Phone Number: ${_controller.text}'); // Print the submitted phone number
          },
          child: Text('Submit'), // Button text
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body consists of a PhoneInputForm widget, which manages the phone number input.
// 4. Inside PhoneInputForm, a TextEditingController is created to manage the input field's state.
// 5. The IntlPhoneField widget is used to create the phone number input field, allowing users to select their country code and enter their phone number.
// 6. When the phone number changes, the complete number is printed to the console.
// 7. An ElevatedButton is provided to submit the form, which prints the entered phone number when pressed.
