   ```

## Basic Usage
To use `fijkplayer_ijkfix`, you can create a simple video player widget. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fijkplayer_ijkfix/fijkplayer_ijkfix.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  FijkPlayer player;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    player = FijkPlayer();
    player.setDataSource("http://your-video-url.com/video.mp4", autoPlay: true);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    player.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("FijkPlayer Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: FijkView(
          player: player,
          fit: FijkFit.cover,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple video player that plays a video from a URL. The `FijkView` widget is used to display the video, and the `FijkPlayer` instance manages the playback.

# Complete Example of fijkplayer_ijkfix

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fijkplayer_ijkfix/fijkplayer_ijkfix.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of FijkPlayer
  FijkPlayer player;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the player
    player = FijkPlayer();
    // Set the data source for the player
    player.setDataSource("http://your-video-url.com/video.mp4", autoPlay: true);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the player when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    player.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("FijkPlayer Example")),
      body: Center(
        // Use FijkView to display the video
        child: FijkView(
          player: player,
          fit: FijkFit.cover, // Set the fit of the video
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. In the initState method, we initialize the FijkPlayer instance.
// 3. We set the data source for the player to a video URL and enable auto-play.
// 4. The dispose method ensures that we clean up the player when the widget is removed.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing the FijkView.
// 6. The FijkView widget is responsible for rendering the video player on the screen.
