# Tutorial: Using the Animated Toggle Flutter Package
=====================================================

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To use the `animated_toggle` package, you need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  animated_toggle: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:animated_toggle/animated_toggle.dart';
```

## Step 3: Use the AnimatedToggle Widget

To use the `AnimatedToggle` widget, you need to provide the following properties:

*   `value`: The current value of the toggle (true or false)
*   `onChanged`: A callback function that is called when the toggle value changes
*   `animationDuration`: The duration of the animation (optional)
*   `animationCurve`: The curve of the animation (optional)

Here is an example:

```dart
AnimatedToggle(
  value: _toggleValue,
  onChanged: (value) {
    setState(() {
      _toggleValue = value;
    });
  },
  animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  animationCurve: Curves.easeInOut,
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

The `animated_toggle` package supports both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to configure some platform-specific settings:

*   Android: You need to add the following code to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

    ```xml
<application
  ...
  android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
  ...
>
```

*   iOS: You need to add the following code to your `Info.plist` file:

    ```xml
<key>UIViewEdgeAntialiasing</key>
<true/>
```

}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _toggleValue = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(

          title: Text('Animated Toggle Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(

            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              AnimatedToggle(
                // The current value of the toggle (true or false)
                value: _toggleValue,
                // A callback function that is called when the toggle value changes
                onChanged: (value) {
                  setState(() {
                    _toggleValue = value;
                  });
                },
                // The duration of the animation (optional)
                animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
                // The curve of the animation (optional)
                animationCurve: Curves.easeInOut,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(
                _toggleValue ? 'Toggle is ON' : 'Toggle is OFF',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow:
// 1. The user runs the app and sees the toggle button in the center of the screen.
// 2. The user taps the toggle button to change its value.
// 3. The onChanged callback function is called, which updates the _toggleValue variable.
// 4. The setState function is called to rebuild the widget tree with the new _toggleValue.
// 5. The AnimatedToggle widget animates the change in value over a duration of 500 milliseconds.
// 6. The animation curve is set to Curves.easeInOut, which makes the animation smooth and natural-looking.
// 7. The text below the toggle button is updated to reflect the new value of the toggle.

// Final summary:
// The code creates a simple Flutter app with an animated toggle button.
// The toggle button is created using the AnimatedToggle widget from the animated_toggle package.
// The widget is configured with a callback function that updates the _toggleValue variable when the toggle value changes.
// The animation duration and curve are set to make the animation smooth and natural-looking.
// The text below the toggle button is updated to reflect the new value of the toggle.
