# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Parchment

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Parchment package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding Parchment to Your Project

To get started, you need to add the Parchment package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  parchment: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter and Parchment versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using Parchment in Your Application

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a rich text editor using the Parchment package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:parchment/parchment.dart'; // Import the Parchment package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Parchment Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Parchment Rich Text Editor'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: RichTextEditor(), // Body contains the rich text editor
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RichTextEditor extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RichTextEditorState createState() => _RichTextEditorState();
}

class _RichTextEditorState extends State<RichTextEditor> {
  String _text = "Hello, Parchment!"; // Initial text

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        Expanded(
          child: ParchmentTextField(
            onChanged: (text) {
              setState(() {
                _text = text; // Update the text state on change
              });
            },
            initialText: _text, // Set initial text
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18), // Text style
          ),
        ),
        Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
          child: Text(
            'Preview:', // Preview label
            style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
          ),
        ),
        Expanded(
          child: SingleChildScrollView(
            child: ParchmentText(
              text: _text, // Display the formatted text
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18), // Text style for preview
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

// The main function initializes the Flutter application by calling `runApp` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget sets up the MaterialApp and the main scaffold with an AppBar and body.
// The `RichTextEditor` widget is a stateful widget that manages the text input and preview.
// Inside the `RichTextEditor`, we have a `ParchmentTextField` for user input and a `ParchmentText` for displaying the formatted text.
// The `_text` variable holds the current text, which is updated whenever the user types in the text field.
// The `onChanged` callback updates the state with the new text, allowing the preview to reflect the changes in real-time.
// The layout consists of an expandable text field for input and a scrollable area for the text preview, providing a user-friendly interface for editing and viewing rich text.

In summary, this application demonstrates how to set up and use the Parchment package to create a simple rich text editor in Flutter. The user can type formatted text, and the application will display a live preview of the text, showcasing the capabilities of the Parchment package.
