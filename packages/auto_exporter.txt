# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Auto Exporter Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **auto_exporter** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  auto_exporter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to write files. Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save exported files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents folder to save exported files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to export data.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:auto_exporter/auto_exporter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Auto Exporter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Sample data to export
              List<Map<String, dynamic>> data = [
                {"Name": "John", "Age": 30},
                {"Name": "Jane", "Age": 25},
              ];

              // Exporting data as CSV
              AutoExporter.exportCSV(data, 'exported_data.csv');
            },
            child: Text('Export Data'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that, when pressed, exports sample data as a CSV file. The `AutoExporter.exportCSV` method handles the export process.

# Complete Example of Using the Auto Exporter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:auto_exporter/auto_exporter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Auto Exporter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Sample data to export
              List<Map<String, dynamic>> data = [
                {"Name": "John", "Age": 30},
                {"Name": "Jane", "Age": 25},
              ];

              // Exporting data as CSV
              AutoExporter.exportCSV(data, 'exported_data.csv');
            },
            child: Text('Export Data'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the app's visual layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers the export process.
// 6. Sample data is defined as a list of maps, where each map represents a row of data to be exported.
// 7. The AutoExporter.exportCSV method is called with the sample data and the desired filename, initiating the export process.
// 8. The user can find the exported CSV file in their device's storage, ready for use.
