# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Animated Introduction Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `animated_introduction` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_introduction: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `animated_introduction` package in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:animated_introduction/animated_introduction.dart';
```

2. Create a new widget that uses the `AnimatedIntroduction` class:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AnimatedIntroduction(
      pages: [
        IntroductionPage(
          title: 'Welcome to RealFlutter',
          description: 'This is an amazing app that helps you learn Flutter.',
          image: AssetImage('assets/images/welcome.png'),
        ),
        IntroductionPage(
          title: 'Features',
          description: 'Explore various features that make Flutter great.',
          image: AssetImage('assets/images/features.png'),
        ),
        IntroductionPage(
          title: 'Get Started',
          description: 'Let\'s get started with your Flutter journey!',
          image: AssetImage('assets/images/get_started.png'),
        ),
      ],
      onFinish: () {
        // Navigate to the main application screen
        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
          MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => MainAppScreen()),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, set `RealFlutter` as the home widget in your `main.dart` file.

With these steps, you have successfully integrated the `animated_introduction` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using Animated Introduction

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_introduction/animated_introduction.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Introduction Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set the RealFlutter widget as the home
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AnimatedIntroduction(
      pages: [
        IntroductionPage(
          title: 'Welcome to RealFlutter',
          description: 'This is an amazing app that helps you learn Flutter.',
          image: AssetImage('assets/images/welcome.png'),
        ),
        IntroductionPage(
          title: 'Features',
          description: 'Explore various features that make Flutter great.',
          image: AssetImage('assets/images/features.png'),
        ),
        IntroductionPage(
          title: 'Get Started',
          description: 'Let\'s get started with your Flutter journey!',
          image: AssetImage('assets/images/get_started.png'),
        ),
      ],
      onFinish: () {
        // Navigate to the main application screen
        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
          MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => MainAppScreen()),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

class MainAppScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Main Application Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the main app!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home widget is set to RealFlutter, which displays the animated introduction.
// 4. The AnimatedIntroduction widget takes a list of IntroductionPage widgets.
// 5. Each IntroductionPage contains a title, description, and an image.
// 6. When the user finishes the introduction, the onFinish callback is triggered.
// 7. This callback navigates the user to the MainAppScreen, which is the main application interface.
