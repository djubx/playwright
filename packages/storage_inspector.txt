# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Storage Inspector

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **storage_inspector** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **storage_inspector** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  storage_inspector: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/storage_inspector).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access storage. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for accessing storage:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to use the **storage_inspector** package to inspect storage.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:storage_inspector/storage_inspector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: StorageInspectorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class StorageInspectorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StorageInspectorScreenState createState() => _StorageInspectorScreenState();
}

class _StorageInspectorScreenState extends State<StorageInspectorScreen> {
  String _storageInfo = 'Fetching storage info...';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchStorageInfo();
  }

  Future<void> _fetchStorageInfo() async {
    // Fetch storage information using the storage_inspector package
    final storageInfo = await StorageInspector.getStorageInfo();
    setState(() {
      _storageInfo = storageInfo.toString();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Storage Inspector'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(_storageInfo),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays the storage information fetched from the device.

# Complete Example of Storage Inspector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:storage_inspector/storage_inspector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: StorageInspectorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class StorageInspectorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StorageInspectorScreenState createState() => _StorageInspectorScreenState();
}

class _StorageInspectorScreenState extends State<StorageInspectorScreen> {
  String _storageInfo = 'Fetching storage info...'; // Initial message

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchStorageInfo(); // Fetch storage info when the widget is initialized
  }

  Future<void> _fetchStorageInfo() async {
    // Fetch storage information using the storage_inspector package
    final storageInfo = await StorageInspector.getStorageInfo();
    setState(() {
      _storageInfo = storageInfo.toString(); // Update the state with fetched info
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Storage Inspector'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(_storageInfo), // Display the storage info
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The StorageInspectorScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. In the _StorageInspectorScreenState, the initState method is called, which triggers the _fetchStorageInfo method.
// 4. The _fetchStorageInfo method uses the StorageInspector package to get the storage information asynchronously.
// 5. Once the data is fetched, the state is updated, and the UI is rebuilt to display the storage information.
```
