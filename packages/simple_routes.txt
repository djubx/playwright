The code flows as follows:

*   The `RealFlutter` widget creates a `MaterialApp` with a `RouteManager`.
*   The `RouteManager` defines the routes for the app.
*   The `HomeScreen` widget creates a `Scaffold` with a button to navigate to the settings screen.
*   The `SettingsScreen` widget creates a `Scaffold` with a button to navigate back to the home screen.
*   The `RouteManager` is used to navigate between the routes.

In summary, the code creates a simple app with two screens and uses the `simple_routes` package to navigate between them.
