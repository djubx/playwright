It provides a straightforward API for defining routes and navigating between them, making it an excellent choice for developers looking for a minimalistic approach to routing.

## When to Use "simple_routes"

- **Small to Medium Applications**: Ideal for projects where complex routing is not required.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Great for quickly setting up navigation without the overhead of more complex routing solutions.
- **Learning and Experimentation**: A good choice for beginners who want to understand routing in Flutter without getting overwhelmed.

## Key Features

- **Simple API**: Easy to define routes and navigate between them.
- **Named Routes**: Supports named routes for better organization.
- **Dynamic Route Parameters**: Allows passing parameters to routes easily.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and a small footprint.

# Setting Up and Using "simple_routes"

## Installation

To add the `simple_routes` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_routes: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Basic Usage

### Step 1: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `simple_routes` package:

```dart
import 'package:simple_routes/simple_routes.dart';
```

### Step 2: Define Your Routes

You can define your routes in a centralized location. For example, create a `routes.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:simple_routes/simple_routes.dart';
import 'package:your_app/screens/home_screen.dart';
import 'package:your_app/screens/details_screen.dart';

class AppRoutes {
  static final routes = {
    '/': (context) => HomeScreen(),
    '/details': (context) => DetailsScreen(),
  };
}
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Router

In your `main.dart`, initialize the router with the defined routes:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_routes/simple_routes.dart';
import 'routes.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Routes Demo',
      initialRoute: '/',
      routes: AppRoutes.routes,
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Navigate Between Screens

To navigate between screens, use the `Navigator` class provided by Flutter:

```dart
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/details');
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` is configured correctly for your app's requirements.
- **iOS**: Make sure to set up the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities.

## Optimizations

- Use `const` constructors for widgets where possible to improve performance.
- Consider using `Navigator.pushReplacementNamed` if you want to replace the current route instead of pushing a new one.

# Complete Example of "simple_routes"

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_routes/simple_routes.dart';
import 'routes.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Routes Demo',
      initialRoute: '/', // Set the initial route to the home screen
      routes: AppRoutes.routes, // Load the defined routes
    );
  }
}

// HomeScreen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the details screen when the button is pressed
            Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/details');
          },
          child: Text('Go to Details'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// DetailsScreen widget
class DetailsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Details Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is the details screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which initializes the MaterialApp.
// 2. The initial route is set to '/', which corresponds to the HomeScreen.
// 3. The HomeScreen displays a button that, when pressed, navigates to the DetailsScreen using the named route '/details'.
// 4. The DetailsScreen is displayed, showing a simple message.
```

In summary, the `simple_routes` package provides a straightforward and efficient way to manage navigation in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, developers can quickly implement routing in their projects, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers looking for simplicity.
