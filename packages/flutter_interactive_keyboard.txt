# flutter_interactive_keyboard Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_interactive_keyboard` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_interactive_keyboard: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_interactive_keyboard).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your application's requirements. However, the package should work out of the box for standard use cases.

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_interactive_keyboard` package, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_interactive_keyboard/flutter_interactive_keyboard.dart';
   ```

2. Create a simple widget that utilizes the interactive keyboard:
   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Interactive Keyboard Example')),
         body: Center(
           child: InteractiveKeyboard(
             onKeyPressed: (key) {
               // Handle key press
               print('Key pressed: $key');
             },
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

3. Run your application to see the interactive keyboard in action.

This setup provides a basic implementation of the `flutter_interactive_keyboard` package, allowing you to capture key presses and respond accordingly.

# Complete Example of flutter_interactive_keyboard

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_interactive_keyboard/flutter_interactive_keyboard.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Interactive Keyboard Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _input = ''; // Variable to hold user input

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Interactive Keyboard Example')),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          Text('Input: $_input', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)), // Display user input
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          InteractiveKeyboard(
            onKeyPressed: (key) {
              // Handle key press
              setState(() {
                _input += key; // Append the pressed key to the input
              });
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of user input.
// 4. The build method of _RealFlutterState creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Column.
// 5. The Column contains a Text widget to display the current input and an InteractiveKeyboard widget.
// 6. When a key is pressed on the InteractiveKeyboard, the onKeyPressed callback is triggered.
// 7. The pressed key is appended to the _input variable, and the UI is updated using setState.
// 8. The updated input is displayed in the Text widget, allowing users to see their input in real-time.
