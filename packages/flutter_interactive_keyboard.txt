// The app starts by running the `RealFlutter` widget, which is a stateless widget that builds a `MaterialApp`.
// The `MaterialApp` has a title and a home page, which is the `KeyboardDemo` widget.
// The `KeyboardDemo` widget is a stateful widget that builds a `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget.
// The `Center` widget contains a `Keyboard` widget, which is customized with a QWERTY keyboard layout and design.
// The `Keyboard` widget has several keys, each with a label and an `onPressed` callback that prints a message to the console.
// The `Keyboard` widget also has `onKeyPressed` and `onKeyReleased` callbacks that print messages to the console when a key is pressed or released.

// In summary, this app demonstrates how to use the `flutter_interactive_keyboard` package to create a customizable keyboard with interactive keys and keyboard events.
