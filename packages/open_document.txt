# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Open Document Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `open_document` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  open_document: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/open_document).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for accessing files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to open documents.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to open files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to open a document:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_document/open_document.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Open Document Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Specify the path to the document you want to open
              String filePath = '/path/to/your/document.pdf';
              // Open the document using the open_document package
              OpenDocument.open(filePath);
            },
            child: Text('Open Document'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the specified document will open using the default document viewer on the device.

# Complete Example of Using the Open Document Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_document/open_document.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Open Document Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Specify the path to the document you want to open
              String filePath = '/path/to/your/document.pdf';
              // Open the document using the open_document package
              OpenDocument.open(filePath);
            },
            child: Text('Open Document'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Open Document Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers the onPressed callback.
// 6. Inside the onPressed callback, the file path of the document to be opened is specified.
// 7. The OpenDocument.open() method is called with the file path, which opens the document using the default viewer on the device.
