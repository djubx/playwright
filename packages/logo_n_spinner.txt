# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Logo_n_Spinner

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `logo_n_spinner` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  logo_n_spinner: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow for network requests if your logo is fetched from a URL. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Logo_n_Spinner Widget

Now that you have set up the package, you can use the `LogoNSpinner` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:logo_n_spinner/logo_n_spinner.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: LogoNSpinner(
            logo: AssetImage('assets/logo.png'), // Your logo asset
            spinnerColor: Colors.blue, // Spinner color
            spinnerSize: 50.0, // Size of the spinner
            logoSize: 100.0, // Size of the logo
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a logo and a spinner in the center of the screen. You can customize the `logo`, `spinnerColor`, `spinnerSize`, and `logoSize` properties to fit your design needs.

# Complete Example of Logo_n_Spinner

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:logo_n_spinner/logo_n_spinner.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the logo and spinner in the middle of the screen
          child: LogoNSpinner(
            logo: AssetImage('assets/logo.png'), // Load your logo from assets
            spinnerColor: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the spinner
            spinnerSize: 50.0, // Define the size of the spinner
            logoSize: 100.0, // Define the size of the logo
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function initializes the app and displays the RealFlutter widget.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The child of the Center widget is the LogoNSpinner widget.
// 6. The LogoNSpinner displays the logo and spinner, providing a visual loading indicator.
// 7. The logo and spinner are customizable through properties like logo, spinnerColor, spinnerSize, and logoSize.
