# Rich Read More Flutter Package

The **rich_readmore** package is a powerful Flutter widget that allows developers to create expandable text sections in their applications. This package is particularly useful for displaying long texts, such as articles, descriptions, or any content that may require a "read more" functionality.

## Features

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Rich Read More Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **rich_readmore** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rich_readmore: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file where you want to use the **rich_readmore** widget, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:rich_readmore/rich_readmore.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Widget
You can now use the `RichReadMore` widget in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
RichReadMore(
  text: 'Your long text goes here...',
  trimLines: 2, // Number of lines to show before "Read more"
  colorClickableText: Colors.blue, // Color of the clickable text
  trimMode: TrimMode.Line, // Mode to trim the text
  moreText: 'Read more', // Text to show when collapsed
  lessText: 'Read less', // Text to show when expanded
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16.0), // Text style
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations
- **Performance**: Use the `RichReadMore` widget in a `ListView` or `Column` to ensure smooth scrolling and performance.
- **Testing**: Test the widget on both Android and iOS devices to ensure consistent behavior.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate the **rich_readmore** package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Rich Read More Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rich_readmore/rich_readmore.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rich Read More Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rich Read More Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Displaying the RichReadMore widget
              RichReadMore(
                text: 'Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google. '
                      'It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, '
                      'Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. Flutter is based on the Dart '
                      'programming language and was first released in May 2017.',
                trimLines: 2, // Show only 2 lines initially
                colorClickableText: Colors.blue, // Color for the clickable text
                trimMode: TrimMode.Line, // Trim mode to use
                moreText: 'Read more', // Text to show when collapsed
                lessText: 'Read less', // Text to show when expanded
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16.0), // Text style
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Rich Read More Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Padding widget to provide space around the content.
// 5. Inside the Padding, a Column widget is used to arrange the RichReadMore widget vertically.
// 6. The RichReadMore widget displays a long text that can be expanded or collapsed.
// 7. Initially, only two lines of text are shown, with options to read more or less.
// 8. The text style and clickable text color are customizable, enhancing the user experience.
