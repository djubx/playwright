# Overview of the udev Flutter Package

The **udev** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to manage device events and states in their applications. It provides a unified interface to interact with various device features, making it easier to build responsive and dynamic applications that react to changes in device state.

## When to Use udev

You might consider using the udev package in scenarios such as:
- Monitoring device connectivity (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi).
- Responding to changes in device orientation or state.
- Implementing features that require real-time updates based on device events.

## Key Features

- **Device State Management**: Easily track and respond to changes in device states.
- **Event Listeners**: Set up listeners for various device events, allowing your app to react dynamically.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS, providing a consistent API across platforms.

Overall, the udev package simplifies the process of managing device events, making it an essential tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance their applications' interactivity and responsiveness.

# Setting Up and Using the udev Package

## Installation

To get started with the udev package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  udev: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/udev).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Depending on the features you are using, you may need to add permissions such as:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add specific keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permissions for certain features. For example:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to function properly.</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires location access to provide better services.</string>
```

## Basic Usage

Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a listener for device state changes:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:udev/udev.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _deviceState = "Unknown";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize udev and set up a listener for device state changes
    Udev.initialize();
    Udev.onDeviceStateChanged.listen((state) {
      setState(() {
        _deviceState = state.toString();
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Device State Monitor")),
      body: Center(
        child: Text("Current Device State: $_deviceState"),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the udev package and listens for device state changes, updating the UI accordingly.

# Complete Example of Using the udev Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:udev/udev.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _deviceState = "Unknown"; // Variable to hold the current device state

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize udev to start listening for device events
    Udev.initialize();
    // Set up a listener for device state changes
    Udev.onDeviceStateChanged.listen((state) {
      setState(() {
        _deviceState = state.toString(); // Update the device state variable
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Device State Monitor")), // App bar title
        body: Center(
          child: Text("Current Device State: $_deviceState"), // Display current device state
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget, allowing it to maintain state.
// 3. In the initState() method, we initialize the udev package and set up a listener for device state changes.
// 4. When a device state change occurs, the listener updates the _deviceState variable.
// 5. The build() method constructs the UI, displaying the current device state in the center of the screen.
// 6. As the device state changes, the UI automatically updates to reflect the new state.
