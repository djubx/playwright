# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flutter Shader Snap

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `flutter_shader_snap`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_shader_snap: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_shader_snap).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable Metal support. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode, and ensure that the "Metal" option is enabled in your project settings.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to apply a shader to a widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_shader_snap/flutter_shader_snap.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Shader Snap Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ShaderSnap(
            shader: Shader.fromAsset('assets/shader.glsl'), // Load your shader
            child: Container(
              width: 200,
              height: 200,
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: Colors.transparent,
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that applies a shader to a container. The `ShaderSnap` widget wraps around the container, allowing the shader to be rendered on it.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we covered how to set up the `flutter_shader_snap` package in your Flutter application, including platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS. We also provided a basic example of how to use the package to apply a shader to a widget.

# Complete Example of Flutter Shader Snap

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_shader_snap/flutter_shader_snap.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Shader Snap Example')),
        body: Center(
          // The ShaderSnap widget applies the shader effect to its child
          child: ShaderSnap(
            // Load the shader from an asset file
            shader: Shader.fromAsset('assets/shader.glsl'),
            child: Container(
              width: 200, // Set the width of the container
              height: 200, // Set the height of the container
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: Colors.transparent, // Make the background transparent
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget holds a ShaderSnap widget, which applies a shader effect.
// 6. The ShaderSnap widget loads a shader from an asset file and applies it to a Container.
// 7. The Container is sized to 200x200 pixels and has a transparent background, allowing the shader effect to be visible.
