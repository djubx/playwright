<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Cryptography Flutter Package

The `cryptography_flutter` package is a powerful library designed for implementing cryptographic operations in Flutter applications. It provides a wide range of cryptographic functionalities, including hashing, encryption, and decryption, making it an essential tool for developers who need to secure sensitive data in their apps.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `cryptography_flutter` package in scenarios such as:
- **Secure Data Storage**: When you need to store sensitive information like passwords or personal data securely.
- **Data Transmission**: When transmitting sensitive data over the network, ensuring that it is encrypted and secure from eavesdropping.
- **Digital Signatures**: When you need to verify the authenticity of messages or documents.

## Features

- **Hashing**: Supports various hashing algorithms like SHA-256, SHA-512, etc.
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Provides symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods.
- **Key Management**: Facilitates secure key generation and management.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

The `cryptography_flutter` package is a versatile tool that can enhance the security of your Flutter applications significantly.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Cryptography Flutter Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `cryptography_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cryptography_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/cryptography_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to allow for cryptographic operations:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to hash a password and encrypt/decrypt a message.

# Complete Example: Using the Cryptography Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cryptography_flutter/cryptography_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cryptography Example',
      home: CryptographyDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class CryptographyDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CryptographyDemoState createState() => _CryptographyDemoState();
}

class _CryptographyDemoState extends State<CryptographyDemo> {
  String _hashedPassword = '';
  String _encryptedMessage = '';
  String _decryptedMessage = '';

  // Function to hash a password
  void _hashPassword(String password) async {
    // Create a SHA-256 hash
    final hash = await Cryptography.sha256.hash(utf8.encode(password));
    setState(() {
      _hashedPassword = hash.toString();
    });
  }

  // Function to encrypt a message
  void _encryptMessage(String message) async {
    // Generate a random key
    final key = await SecretKey.generate();
    // Encrypt the message
    final encrypted = await AesGcm.with256bits().encrypt(
      utf8.encode(message),
      secretKey: key,
    );
    setState(() {
      _encryptedMessage = encrypted.cipherText.toString();
    });

    // Decrypt the message
    final decrypted = await AesGcm.with256bits().decrypt(
      encrypted,
      secretKey: key,
    );
    setState(() {
      _decryptedMessage = utf8.decode(decrypted);
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Cryptography Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              onSubmitted: _hashPassword,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter Password to Hash'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Hashed Password: $_hashedPassword'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            TextField(
              onSubmitted: _encryptMessage,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter Message to Encrypt'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Encrypted Message: $_encryptedMessage'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Decrypted Message: $_decryptedMessage'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to CryptographyDemo.
// 3. CryptographyDemo is a stateful widget that manages the state for hashing and encrypting messages.
// 4. The user can input a password to hash or a message to encrypt in the provided text fields.
// 5. When the user submits the password, _hashPassword is called, which hashes the password using SHA-256 and updates the state.
// 6. When the user submits a message, _encryptMessage is called, which encrypts the message using AES-GCM and then decrypts it, updating the state with both the encrypted and decrypted messages.
// 7. The UI displays the hashed password, encrypted message, and decrypted message dynamically as the user interacts with the app.
```
