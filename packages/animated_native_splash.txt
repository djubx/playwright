# Tutorial: Setting Up Animated Native Splash

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `animated_native_splash` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
First, add the `animated_native_splash` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_native_splash: ^2.0.0 # Check for the latest version
```

## Step 2: Configure for Android
1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following lines inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:theme="@style/LaunchTheme"
    android:launchMode="singleTop"
    android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|smallestScreenSize|locale|layoutDirection|fontScale|screenLayout|direction|uiMode"
    android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
    android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
    <meta-data
        android:name="flutterEmbedding"
        android:value="2" />
</activity>
```

2. Create a new style in `android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml`:

```xml
<resources>
    <style name="LaunchTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.NoActionBar">
        <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/splash</item>
    </style>
</resources>
```

3. Create a drawable resource for the splash screen in `android/app/src/main/res/drawable/splash.xml`:

```xml
<layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item android:drawable="@color/white" /> <!-- Background color -->
    <item>
        <bitmap
            android:src="@mipmap/ic_launcher" <!-- Your logo -->
            android:gravity="center" />
    </item>
</layer-list>
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>UILaunchStoryboardName</key>
<string>LaunchScreen</string>
```

2. Create a new file named `LaunchScreen.storyboard` in `ios/Runner` and design your splash screen using Interface Builder.

## Step 4: Initialize the Package
In your `main.dart` file, initialize the package in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_native_splash/animated_native_splash.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await AnimatedNativeSplash.init();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Customize Your Splash Screen
You can customize the splash screen by modifying the `AnimatedNativeSplash` settings in your `main.dart` file. For example:

```dart
AnimatedNativeSplash.screen(
  duration: 3000, // Duration of the splash screen
  splash: 'assets/logo.png', // Path to your logo
  nextScreen: HomeScreen(), // The next screen after the splash
);
```

Now, you have successfully set up the `animated_native_splash` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Animated Native Splash

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_native_splash/animated_native_splash.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure that Flutter bindings are initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize the animated splash screen
  await AnimatedNativeSplash.init();
  
  // Run the main application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Return the MaterialApp widget
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Native Splash Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: AnimatedNativeSplash.screen(
        duration: 3000, // Duration of the splash screen
        splash: 'assets/logo.png', // Path to your logo
        nextScreen: HomeScreen(), // The next screen after the splash
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build the home screen with a simple layout
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter bindings and the animated splash screen.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is the main application widget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The AnimatedNativeSplash.screen method is called to display the splash screen for 3000 milliseconds.
// 4. After the splash duration, the app transitions to the HomeScreen.
// 5. The HomeScreen displays a simple welcome message to the user.
```
