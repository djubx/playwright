# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `nuts_activity_indicator`

In this section, we'll walk through the process of setting up the `nuts_activity_indicator` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `nuts_activity_indicator` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  nuts_activity_indicator: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:nuts_activity_indicator/nuts_activity_indicator.dart';
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

No additional configuration is required for Android. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 16.

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Using the Package

To use the `nuts_activity_indicator`, simply include it in your widget tree. Here's a basic example:

```dart
NutsActivityIndicator(
  radius: 20,
  activeColor: Colors.blue,
  inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
  tickCount: 12,
  startRatio: 0.55,
  animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
)
```

### Customization Options

- **`radius`**: Sets the size of the indicator.
- **`activeColor`**: Color of the active ticks.

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

Below is a complete example demonstrating the use of the `nuts_activity_indicator` package in a Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nuts_activity_indicator/nuts_activity_indicator.dart';

// Main entry point of the Flutter application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Nuts Activity Indicator Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget displaying the activity indicator
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Activity Indicator Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Using NutsActivityIndicator to show a loading spinner
        child: NutsActivityIndicator(
          radius: 30, // Size of the indicator
          activeColor: Colors.blue, // Color of active ticks
          inactiveColor: Colors.grey, // Color of inactive ticks
          tickCount: 12, // Number of ticks
          startRatio: 0.55, // Starting point of the animation
          animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Animation speed
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// Application Flow Explanation
// 1. The `main` function is the entry point of the application, which calls `runApp` with `MyApp`.
// 2. `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The `HomeScreen` widget is the main screen of the app, containing an AppBar and a centered `NutsActivityIndicator`.
// 4. The `NutsActivityIndicator` is configured with various properties to customize its appearance and behavior.
// 5. The app displays a loading spinner in the center of the screen, providing visual feedback for loading states.
