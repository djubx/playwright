# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using sharpapi_flutter_client

## Installation
To get started with `sharpapi_flutter_client`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sharpapi_flutter_client: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet. Add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow arbitrary loads if you are testing with non-HTTPS endpoints. Add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `sharpapi_flutter_client`, you will typically create an instance of the main class, `RealFlutter`, and call its methods to perform API operations. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to make a GET request:

```dart
import 'package:sharpapi_flutter_client/sharpapi_flutter_client.dart';

void main() async {
  // Create an instance of RealFlutter
  final apiClient = RealFlutter();

  // Make a GET request
  final response = await apiClient.get('https://api.example.com/data');

  // Check if the request was successful
  if (response.isSuccessful) {
    // Process the data
    print(response.data);
  } else {
    // Handle the error
    print('Error: ${response.error}');
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to initialize the client, make a GET request, and handle the response.

# Complete Example of sharpapi_flutter_client

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sharpapi_flutter_client/sharpapi_flutter_client.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SharpAPI Client Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  // Create an instance of RealFlutter
  final apiClient = RealFlutter();
  String data = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch data when the widget is initialized
    fetchData();
  }

  // Function to fetch data from the API
  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    // Make a GET request to the API
    final response = await apiClient.get('https://api.example.com/data');

    // Check if the request was successful
    if (response.isSuccessful) {
      // Update the state with the fetched data
      setState(() {
        data = response.data.toString();
      });
    } else {
      // Handle the error
      setState(() {
        data = 'Error: ${response.error}';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SharpAPI Client Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(data), // Display the fetched data
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a HomePage as the home widget.
// 3. HomePage initializes an instance of RealFlutter and fetches data in initState.
// 4. fetchData() makes a GET request to the specified API endpoint.
// 5. If the request is successful, the data is stored in the state and displayed.
// 6. If there's an error, the error message is displayed instead.
