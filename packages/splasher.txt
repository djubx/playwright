# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "splasher" Package

## Installation

To get started with the "splasher" package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  splasher: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations. Typically, no additional configurations are required for the "splasher" package, but make sure your app's theme is set correctly.

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to adjust the `Info.plist` file to ensure that your app supports the required orientations and has the correct permissions. Again, no specific configurations are needed for the "splasher" package.

## Using the Package

To use the "splasher" package, you will need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:splasher/splasher.dart';
```

You can then create a splash screen by using the `Splasher` widget. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
Splasher(
  seconds: 3, // Duration of the splash screen
  logo: 'assets/logo.png', // Path to your logo image
  title: 'Welcome to My App', // Title text
  backgroundColor: Colors.blue, // Background color
  onDone: () {
    // Navigate to the home screen after the splash
    Navigator.pushReplacement(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => HomeScreen()));
  },
);
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to set up a simple splash screen with a logo, title, and background color. The `onDone` callback is triggered after the specified duration, allowing you to navigate to the main part of your app.

# Complete Example of Using the "splasher" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:splasher/splasher.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Splasher Example',
      home: SplashScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class SplashScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Splasher(
      seconds: 3, // Duration for which the splash screen is displayed
      logo: 'assets/logo.png', // Path to the logo image
      title: 'Welcome to My App', // Title displayed on the splash screen
      backgroundColor: Colors.blue, // Background color of the splash screen
      onDone: () {
        // This function is called when the splash screen is done
        Navigator.pushReplacement(
          context,
          MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => HomeScreen()), // Navigate to HomeScreen
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'), // Title of the home screen
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Hello, World!'), // Main content of the home screen
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and specifies SplashScreen as the home widget.
// 3. The SplashScreen widget uses the Splasher package to display a splash screen for 3 seconds.
// 4. During this time, the logo and title are shown with a blue background.
// 5. After 3 seconds, the onDone callback is triggered, navigating to the HomeScreen.
// 6. The HomeScreen displays a simple message "Hello, World!" in the center of the screen.
