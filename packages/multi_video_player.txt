# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Multi Video Player

## Installation
To get started with the `multi_video_player` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multi_video_player: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/multi_video_player).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions to allow video playback:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the microphone for video recording.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for video recording.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `multi_video_player`, you can create a simple widget that initializes and displays multiple video players. Below is a basic example of how to set it up.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multi_video_player/multi_video_player.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late MultiVideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the MultiVideoPlayerController with a list of video URLs
    _controller = MultiVideoPlayerController(
      videoUrls: [
        'https://www.example.com/video1.mp4',
        'https://www.example.com/video2.mp4',
        'https://www.example.com/video3.mp4',
      ],
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Multi Video Player Example')),
      body: MultiVideoPlayer(
        controller: _controller,
        aspectRatio: 16 / 9, // Set the aspect ratio for the video players
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic multi-video player application. The `MultiVideoPlayerController` is initialized with a list of video URLs, and the `MultiVideoPlayer` widget is used to display the videos.

# Complete Example of Multi Video Player

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multi_video_player/multi_video_player.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late MultiVideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the MultiVideoPlayerController with a list of video URLs
    _controller = MultiVideoPlayerController(
      videoUrls: [
        'https://www.example.com/video1.mp4', // First video URL
        'https://www.example.com/video2.mp4', // Second video URL
        'https://www.example.com/video3.mp4', // Third video URL
      ],
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Multi Video Player Example')),
      body: MultiVideoPlayer(
        controller: _controller, // Pass the controller to the MultiVideoPlayer
        aspectRatio: 16 / 9, // Set the aspect ratio for the video players
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. In the initState method, we initialize the MultiVideoPlayerController with a list of video URLs.
// 3. The controller is disposed of in the dispose method to free up resources when the widget is removed.
// 4. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a MultiVideoPlayer widget.
// 5. The MultiVideoPlayer widget takes the controller and displays the videos with the specified aspect ratio.
