```dart
// Import the iirjdart package
import 'package:iirjdart/iirjdart.dart';

// Create a new class that extends the RealFlutter class
class RealFlutterExample extends RealFlutter {
  // Create a new instance of the RealFlutterExample class
  RealFlutterExample() : super();

  // Override the init method to initialize the package
  @override
  void init() {
    // Initialize the package
    super.init();
  }

  // Override the build method to build the UI
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a new Text widget
    return Text('Hello, World!');
  }
}

// Create a new main function
void main() {
  // Create a new instance of the RealFlutterExample class
  RealFlutterExample example = RealFlutterExample();

  // Initialize the package
  example.init();

  // Run the app
  runApp(example);
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The main function is called, which creates a new instance of the RealFlutterExample class.
// 2. The init method is called, which initializes the package.
// 3. The build method is called, which builds the UI.
// 4. The app is run using the runApp function.
// The iirjdart package provides a range of APIs and tools that can be used to build complex applications.
// The package is designed to work on both Android and iOS platforms.
// To get the best performance out of the package, you need to configure and optimize it correctly.
