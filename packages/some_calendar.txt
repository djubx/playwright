# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using "some_calendar"

## Installation
To get started with the **some_calendar** package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  some_calendar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow for calendar access if your app requires it. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your calendar.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the **some_calendar** package, you can create a simple calendar widget in your Flutter app. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:some_calendar/some_calendar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Some Calendar Example')),
        body: CalendarWidget(), // Your calendar widget here
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CalendarWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CalendarWidgetState createState() => _CalendarWidgetState();
}

class _CalendarWidgetState extends State<CalendarWidget> {
  DateTime selectedDate = DateTime.now();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SomeCalendar(
      onDateSelected: (date) {
        setState(() {
          selectedDate = date; // Update the selected date
        });
      },
      initialDate: selectedDate,
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a calendar. The user can select a date, which updates the state of the app.

# Complete Example of "some_calendar"

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:some_calendar/some_calendar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the app with RealFlutter widget
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Some Calendar Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: CalendarHome(), // Home widget containing the calendar
    );
  }
}

class CalendarHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CalendarHomeState createState() => _CalendarHomeState();
}

class _CalendarHomeState extends State<CalendarHome> {
  DateTime selectedDate = DateTime.now(); // Initialize selected date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Some Calendar Example')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the selected date
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text(
              'Selected Date: ${selectedDate.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0], // Format the date
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ),
          Expanded(
            child: SomeCalendar(
              onDateSelected: (date) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedDate = date; // Update the selected date on selection
                });
              },
              initialDate: selectedDate, // Set the initial date
              eventDates: [DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 5))], // Example of marking an event
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The CalendarHome widget is the main screen that contains the calendar.
// Inside CalendarHome, we maintain the selected date in the state.
// The Scaffold widget provides the app structure with an AppBar and body.
// The body contains a Text widget to display the selected date and a SomeCalendar widget.
// The SomeCalendar widget allows users to select a date, which updates the selectedDate state.
// We also demonstrate marking an event on a specific date (5 days from now).
// This example showcases how to integrate the some_calendar package into a Flutter app.
