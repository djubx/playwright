# debounced_text_form_field: A Flutter Package for Efficient Text Input

The `debounced_text_form_field` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance user experience in text input scenarios. This package is particularly useful in situations where you want to minimize the number of events triggered by user input, such as API calls or complex validations. By implementing a debounce mechanism, it allows you to wait for a specified duration after the user stops typing before executing a function, thus reducing unnecessary processing and improving performance.

## When to Use This Package
- **Search Fields**: When implementing a search feature that queries a database or API based on user input.
- **Form Validation**: To validate user input in real-time without overwhelming the system with requests.
- **Auto-Save Features**: To save user input after a pause, preventing data loss while minimizing write operations.

## Key Features
- **Debounce Functionality**: Automatically waits for a specified duration after the last keystroke before executing a callback.
- **Customizable Duration**: Allows developers to set the debounce duration according to their needs.
- **Integration with Flutter Forms**: Works seamlessly with Flutter's `TextFormField`, making it easy to integrate into existing forms.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using debounced_text_form_field

## Installation
To get started with the `debounced_text_form_field` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  debounced_text_form_field: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Usage
### Basic Setup
To use the `debounced_text_form_field`, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:debounced_text_form_field/debounced_text_form_field.dart';
```

### Example Implementation
Hereâ€™s how to implement a simple search feature using the `debounced_text_form_field`:

1. **Create a Stateful Widget**: This will hold the text field and manage the state.
2. **Use the DebouncedTextFormField**: Replace the standard `TextFormField` with `DebouncedTextFormField`.
3. **Handle Input Changes**: Define a callback function that will be triggered after the debounce duration.

### Platform-Specific Considerations
- **Android**: Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions if you are making network requests.
- **iOS**: You may need to configure App Transport Security settings if you are accessing non-secure HTTP endpoints.

### Example Code Snippet
```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _searchQuery = '';

  void _onSearchChanged(String value) {
    setState(() {
      _searchQuery = value;
    });
    // Here you can add your API call or search logic
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Debounced Text Form Field Example')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: DebouncedTextFormField(
          onChanged: _onSearchChanged,
          debounceDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Set debounce duration
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            labelText: 'Search',
            border: OutlineInputBorder(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of debounced_text_form_field

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:debounced_text_form_field/debounced_text_form_field.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Debounced Text Form Field Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _searchQuery = ''; // Variable to hold the search query

  // Callback function that gets called when the text changes
  void _onSearchChanged(String value) {
    setState(() {
      _searchQuery = value; // Update the search query
    });
    // Here you can add your API call or search logic
    print('Search Query: $_searchQuery'); // For demonstration purposes
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Debounced Text Form Field Example')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: DebouncedTextFormField(
          onChanged: _onSearchChanged, // Set the callback for text changes
          debounceDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Set debounce duration
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            labelText: 'Search',
            border: OutlineInputBorder(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the search query.
// 4. The _onSearchChanged method is called whenever the text in the DebouncedTextFormField changes.
// 5. The debounce duration is set to 500 milliseconds, meaning the _onSearchChanged method will only be called after the user stops typing for half a second.
// 6. The search query is printed to the console for demonstration purposes, but this is where you would typically trigger an API call or search logic.
