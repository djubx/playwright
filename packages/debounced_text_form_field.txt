// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user types a search query in the text form field.
// 2. The `DebouncedTextFormField` widget debounces the text input changes by the specified duration (500 milliseconds in this example).
// 3. After the debounce duration, the `_handleTextInputChanges` function is called with the latest search query.
// 4. The `_handleTextInputChanges` function updates the `_searchQuery` state variable with the latest search query.
// 5. The `_handleTextInputChanges` function calls the API or performs the database query with the latest search query.
// 6. If the user submits the text form field, the `_handleTextInputSubmission` function is called with the latest search query.
// 7. The `_handleTextInputSubmission` function calls the API or performs the database query with the latest search query.

// In summary, the `DebouncedTextFormField` widget debounces the text input changes by a specified duration, allowing for a more seamless user experience. The application flow involves handling text input changes and submission, updating the state variable, and calling the API or performing the database query.
