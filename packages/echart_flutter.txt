# Tutorial: Setting Up Echart Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `echart_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `echart_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  echart_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Podfile` and ensure that the platform is set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `echart_flutter` package:

```dart
import 'package:echart_flutter/echart_flutter.dart';
```

## Step 5: Basic Usage

You can now use the `Echart` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a basic line chart:

```dart
Echart(
  option: '''
  {
    title: {
      text: 'Sample Line Chart'
    },
    tooltip: {},
    xAxis: {
      data: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun']
    },
    yAxis: {},
    series: [{
      name: 'Sales',
      type: 'line',
      data: [120, 200, 150, 80, 70, 110, 130]
    }]
  }
  ''',
)
```

This code snippet creates a simple line chart with sales data for each day of the week.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and start using the `echart_flutter` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Echart Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:echart_flutter/echart_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Echart Flutter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Echart Flutter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Echart(
            option: '''
            {
              title: {
                text: 'Sales Data'
              },
              tooltip: {},
              legend: {
                data: ['Sales', 'Expenses']
              },
              xAxis: {
                data: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun']
              },
              yAxis: {},
              series: [
                {
                  name: 'Sales',
                  type: 'bar',
                  data: [120, 200, 150, 80, 70, 110, 130]
                },
                {
                  name: 'Expenses',
                  type: 'bar',
                  data: [90, 180, 120, 60, 50, 100, 110]
                }
              ]
            }
            ''',
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that displays a bar chart using the echart_flutter package.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Echart Flutter Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers an Echart widget.
// 5. The Echart widget is configured with a JSON string that defines a bar chart with sales and expenses data for each day of the week.
// 6. The chart displays two series: one for sales and one for expenses, allowing for easy comparison of the two datasets.
```
