# flutter_adb Package Overview

The `flutter_adb` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for seamless interaction with Android Debug Bridge (ADB) directly from Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for developers who need to execute ADB commands programmatically, enabling functionalities such as installing APKs, running shell commands, and managing devices.

## When to Use `flutter_adb`

- **Automated Testing**: When you need to automate the testing of your Flutter applications on Android devices.
- **Device Management**: For applications that require managing multiple Android devices or emulators.
- **Development Tools**: When building development tools that need to interact with ADB for tasks like installing apps or retrieving logs.

## Key Features

- **Execute ADB Commands**: Run any ADB command directly from your Flutter app.
- **Device Management**: List connected devices and manage them effectively.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: While primarily focused on Android, it can be integrated into cross-platform workflows.

Overall, `flutter_adb` is an essential package for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with ADB capabilities.

# Setup and Usage of flutter_adb

## Installation

To add the `flutter_adb` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_adb: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_adb).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. **Permissions**: Ensure that your Android app has the necessary permissions to execute ADB commands. You may need to add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

2. **Enable Developer Options**: Make sure that Developer Options are enabled on your Android device, and USB debugging is turned on.

### iOS

Currently, `flutter_adb` is primarily designed for Android, and there are no specific configurations required for iOS. However, you can still use Flutter's other capabilities for cross-platform development.

## Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the `flutter_adb` package in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_adb/flutter_adb.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _output = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _executeAdbCommand();
  }

  Future<void> _executeAdbCommand() async {
    // Initialize ADB
    final adb = FlutterAdb();

    // Execute a command to list connected devices
    final devices = await adb.getDevices();
    setState(() {
      _output = devices.join('\n');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter ADB Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text(_output)),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the ADB, execute a command to list connected devices, and display the output in the app's UI.

# Complete Example of flutter_adb

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_adb/flutter_adb.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _output = ''; // Variable to hold the output of ADB commands

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _executeAdbCommand(); // Call the function to execute ADB command on initialization
  }

  Future<void> _executeAdbCommand() async {
    final adb = FlutterAdb(); // Create an instance of FlutterAdb

    // Execute a command to list connected devices
    final devices = await adb.getDevices(); // Get the list of connected devices
    setState(() {
      _output = devices.join('\n'); // Update the output variable with the list of devices
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter ADB Example')), // App bar with title
      body: Center(child: Text(_output)), // Display the output in the center of the screen
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, _executeAdbCommand is called to fetch connected devices.
// 3. The _executeAdbCommand method creates an instance of FlutterAdb.
// 4. It then calls getDevices() to retrieve a list of connected devices.
// 5. The output is updated in the state, which triggers a rebuild of the UI.
// 6. Finally, the list of devices is displayed in the center of the screen.
```
