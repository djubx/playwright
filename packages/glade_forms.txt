# Glade Forms: A Comprehensive Overview

The **glade_forms** Flutter package is designed to simplify the process of creating and managing forms in Flutter applications. It provides a robust framework for building dynamic forms with various input types, validation, and state management. This package is particularly useful for developers who need to implement complex forms that require user input, such as registration forms, surveys, or data entry applications.

## When to Use Glade Forms
- **Dynamic Forms**: When your application requires forms that can change based on user input or other conditions.
- **Validation**: If you need to implement complex validation rules for user inputs.
- **State Management**: When managing the state of form fields is crucial for your application.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Field Generation**: Easily create forms with fields that can be added or removed based on user interaction.
- **Built-in Validation**: Supports various validation rules to ensure data integrity.
- **Custom Input Types**: Allows the use of custom widgets for form fields.
- **State Management**: Efficiently manages the state of form fields, making it easier to handle user input.

Overall, the glade_forms package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to streamline form creation and management in their applications.

# Glade Forms: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the glade_forms package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  glade_forms: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/glade_forms).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow for any specific permissions required by your form fields, such as camera access for image uploads.

## Basic Usage
To use the glade_forms package, you will typically create a form widget that utilizes the provided form management features. Below is a simple example of how to set up a basic form.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:glade_forms/glade_forms.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Glade Forms Example')),
        body: FormWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class FormWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GladeForm(
      onSubmit: (formData) {
        // Handle form submission
        print(formData);
      },
      fields: [
        GladeTextField(
          label: 'Name',
          validator: (value) {
            if (value.isEmpty) {
              return 'Please enter your name';
            }
            return null;
          },
        ),
        GladeEmailField(
          label: 'Email',
          validator: (value) {
            if (!RegExp(r'^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+').hasMatch(value)) {
              return 'Please enter a valid email';
            }
            return null;
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple form with two fields: a text field for the name and an email field. Each field has its own validation logic.

# Complete Example of Glade Forms in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:glade_forms/glade_forms.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Glade Forms Example')),
        body: FormWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class FormWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GladeForm(
      onSubmit: (formData) {
        // Handle form submission
        print(formData); // Print the submitted form data to the console
      },
      fields: [
        GladeTextField(
          label: 'Name',
          validator: (value) {
            // Validate the name field
            if (value.isEmpty) {
              return 'Please enter your name'; // Return error if empty
            }
            return null; // Return null if valid
          },
        ),
        GladeEmailField(
          label: 'Email',
          validator: (value) {
            // Validate the email field
            if (!RegExp(r'^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+').hasMatch(value)) {
              return 'Please enter a valid email'; // Return error if invalid
            }
            return null; // Return null if valid
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the FormWidget.
// 3. The FormWidget creates a GladeForm with two fields: Name and Email.
// 4. Each field has a validator that checks for empty input or invalid email format.
// 5. Upon submission, the form data is printed to the console if all validations pass.
