# Simple Animations Flutter Package

The **simple_animations** package is a powerful and flexible animation library for Flutter that simplifies the process of creating complex animations. It provides a straightforward API for animating properties of widgets, making it easier for developers to implement animations without diving deep into the intricacies of Flutter's animation framework.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **simple_animations** package when:
- You want to create smooth and visually appealing animations with minimal code.
- You need to animate multiple properties of a widget simultaneously.
- You are looking for a way to manage animations in a more declarative style.

## Key Features
- **MultiTween**: Allows you to animate multiple properties at once.
- **PlayAnimation**: A widget that plays animations based on a given controller.
- **Custom Curves**: Supports custom animation curves for more control over the animation's timing.
- **Looping and Reversing**: Easily set animations to loop or reverse.
- **Built-in Transitions**: Comes with a variety of built-in transitions for common use cases.

With these features, **simple_animations** makes it easy to create engaging user interfaces that respond to user interactions and enhance the overall user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Animations

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **simple_animations** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_animations: ^3.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have the package installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a basic animation using the **simple_animations** package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:simple_animations/simple_animations.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that uses the `PlayAnimation` widget to animate a property. 

3. Use `MultiTween` to define the properties you want to animate.

This setup will allow you to create smooth animations with minimal effort.

# Complete Example of Simple Animations

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_animations/simple_animations.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Animations Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Simple Animations Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: PlayAnimation<double>(
            // Define the animation using MultiTween
            tween: MultiTween<double>()
              ..add('scale', Tween(begin: 0.5, end: 1.5), Duration(seconds: 1))
              ..add('opacity', Tween(begin: 0.0, end: 1.0), Duration(seconds: 1)),
            // Control the animation
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
            // Loop the animation
            curve: Curves.easeInOut,
            // Build the animated widget
            builder: (context, child, value) {
              return Opacity(
                opacity: value['opacity'], // Set opacity
                child: Transform.scale(
                  scale: value['scale'], // Set scale
                  child: Container(
                    width: 100,
                    height: 100,
                    color: Colors.blue,
                  ),
                ),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a PlayAnimation widget is used to animate a Container.
// 5. MultiTween is defined to animate the 'scale' and 'opacity' properties over a duration of 2 seconds.
// 6. The builder function receives the animated values and applies them to the Container, which scales and fades in.
// 7. The animation loops continuously, creating a smooth scaling and fading effect for the blue square.
