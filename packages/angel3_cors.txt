# Overview of the angel3_cors Flutter Package

The `angel3_cors` package is a powerful tool designed to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Flutter applications. CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent malicious websites from accessing resources from another domain without permission. This package simplifies the process of configuring CORS in your Flutter applications, making it easier to interact with APIs hosted on different domains.

## When to Use `angel3_cors`

You should consider using `angel3_cors` when:
- Your Flutter application needs to communicate with APIs hosted on different domains.
- You want to manage CORS settings easily without diving deep into server configurations.
- You are developing a web application using Flutter and need to ensure proper CORS handling.

## Key Features
- **Easy Configuration**: Simplifies the setup of CORS headers in your Flutter application.
- **Flexible Options**: Allows customization of allowed origins, methods, and headers.
- **Integration with Angel Framework**: Works seamlessly with the Angel framework, enhancing its capabilities.

By leveraging `angel3_cors`, developers can ensure that their applications can securely and efficiently communicate with external APIs while adhering to CORS policies.

# Setting Up and Using angel3_cors

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `angel3_cors` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the `angel3_cors` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  angel3_cors: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow arbitrary loads if you are testing with non-secure HTTP requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `angel3_cors` package, you need to set up CORS in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to configure it:

```dart
import 'package:angel3_cors/angel3_cors.dart';
import 'package:angel3/angel3.dart';

void main() {
  final app = Angel();

  // Configure CORS
  app.use(cors(
    origins: ['https://example.com'], // Allowed origins
    methods: ['GET', 'POST'], // Allowed methods
    allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type'], // Allowed headers
  ));

  // Define a simple route
  app.get('/api/data', (req, res) {
    res.json({'message': 'Hello from CORS-enabled API!'});
  });

  // Start the server
  app.startServer('localhost', 3000).then((_) {
    print('Server running at http://localhost:3000');
  });
}
```

In this example, we set up a simple Angel server with CORS enabled, allowing requests from `https://example.com` and supporting `GET` and `POST` methods.

# Complete Example of angel3_cors in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:angel3_cors/angel3_cors.dart'; // Import the CORS package
import 'package:angel3/angel3.dart'; // Import the Angel framework

void main() {
  final app = Angel(); // Create an instance of the Angel application

  // Configure CORS settings
  app.use(cors(
    origins: ['https://example.com'], // Specify allowed origins
    methods: ['GET', 'POST'], // Specify allowed HTTP methods
    allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type'], // Specify allowed headers
  ));

  // Define a route for the API
  app.get('/api/data', (req, res) {
    // Respond with a JSON object
    res.json({'message': 'Hello from CORS-enabled API!'});
  });

  // Start the server on localhost at port 3000
  app.startServer('localhost', 3000).then((_) {
    print('Server running at http://localhost:3000'); // Log server status
  });
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts by creating an instance of the Angel framework.
2. CORS is configured to allow requests from 'https://example.com' with specified methods and headers.
3. A GET route is defined at '/api/data', which responds with a JSON message.
4. The server is started on localhost at port 3000, and a message is printed to the console indicating that the server is running.
5. When a request is made to '/api/data' from an allowed origin, the server responds with the JSON message, demonstrating successful CORS handling.

### Summary of the Code Flow
The provided code sets up a simple server using the `angel3_cors` package to handle CORS. It allows requests from a specified origin and defines a single API endpoint that returns a JSON response. The application flow is straightforward: upon starting, it configures CORS, defines the API route, and listens for incoming requests, ensuring that only allowed origins can access the resources. This setup is essential for developing secure and compliant web applications that interact with external APIs.
