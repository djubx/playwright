# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_bootstrap5

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_bootstrap5` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_bootstrap5` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_bootstrap5: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter and iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple Flutter application that utilizes Bootstrap components.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bootstrap5/flutter_bootstrap5.dart';
```

2. Use Bootstrap components in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example of a responsive layout using Bootstrap's grid system.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bootstrap5/flutter_bootstrap5.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Bootstrap 5 Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bootstrap 5 in Flutter'),
        ),
        body: BootstrapContainer(
          fluid: true, // Use a fluid container
          children: [
            BootstrapRow(
              children: [
                BootstrapCol(
                  sizes: 'col-md-6', // 6 columns on medium and larger screens
                  child: Card(
                    child: Padding(
                      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                      child: Text('Column 1'),
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
                BootstrapCol(
                  sizes: 'col-md-6', // 6 columns on medium and larger screens
                  child: Card(
                    child: Padding(
                      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                      child: Text('Column 2'),
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
              ],
            ),
            BootstrapRow(
              children: [
                BootstrapCol(
                  sizes: 'col', // Full width on small screens
                  child: Card(
                    child: Padding(
                      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                      child: Text('Full Width Column'),
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The main function initializes the app and sets up the MaterialApp widget.
// The RealFlutter class is the main widget that builds the UI.
// Inside the build method, we create a Scaffold with an AppBar and a BootstrapContainer.
// The BootstrapContainer is set to fluid, allowing it to take the full width of the screen.
// We create two BootstrapRows, each containing BootstrapCols to define the layout.
// The first row has two columns that take half the width on medium and larger screens.
// The second row has a single column that takes the full width on smaller screens.
// Each column contains a Card widget with some padding and text.

// This structure allows for a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes,
// leveraging Bootstrap's grid system to create a clean and organized layout.
