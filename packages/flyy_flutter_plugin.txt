# Tutorial: Setting Up the Flyy Flutter Plugin

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **flyy_flutter_plugin** and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **flyy_flutter_plugin** to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flyy_flutter_plugin: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21  // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Plugin

Now that we have set up the plugin, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flyy_flutter_plugin/flyy_flutter_plugin.dart';
```

2. Initialize the Flyy service in your main application file:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  Flyy.initialize(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'); // Replace with your actual API key
}
```

3. Use the Flyy service for user authentication and data synchronization as needed in your app.

This setup will allow you to leverage the full capabilities of the **flyy_flutter_plugin** in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Flyy Flutter Plugin

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flyy_flutter_plugin/flyy_flutter_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  // Initialize the Flyy service with your API key
  Flyy.initialize(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'); // Replace with your actual API key
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flyy Flutter Plugin Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  String _status = 'Not logged in'; // Variable to hold the login status

  // Method to handle user login
  void _login() async {
    try {
      // Attempt to log in the user
      await Flyy.login(email: 'user@example.com', password: 'password123');
      setState(() {
        _status = 'Logged in successfully!'; // Update status on successful login
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _status = 'Login failed: $e'; // Update status on login failure
      });
    }
  }

  // Method to handle user logout
  void _logout() async {
    await Flyy.logout(); // Call the logout method from Flyy
    setState(() {
      _status = 'Logged out successfully!'; // Update status on logout
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flyy Flutter Plugin Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_status), // Display the current login status
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _login, // Call the login method on button press
              child: Text('Login'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _logout, // Call the logout method on button press
              child: Text('Logout'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing the Flyy service with an API key.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp and the home page.
// 3. The HomePage widget manages the login state and provides buttons for login and logout.
// 4. When the user presses the "Login" button, the _login method is called, which attempts to log in the user.
// 5. If the login is successful, the status is updated to reflect the successful login.
// 6. If the user presses the "Logout" button, the _logout method is called, logging the user out and updating the status accordingly.
```
