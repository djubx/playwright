# Palestine First Run Flutter Package
=====================================

The `palestine_first_run` Flutter package is a utility package that helps developers detect whether their app is running for the first time on a user's device. This package provides a simple and efficient way to check if the app is running for the first time, allowing developers to perform specific actions or display certain content only on the first run.

### Features

*   Detects whether the app is running for the first time on a user's device
*   Provides a simple and efficient way to check if the app is running for the first time
*   Allows developers to perform specific actions or display certain content only on the first run

### Examples of When to Use This Package

*   Displaying a tutorial or guide on the first run of the app
*   Asking users to accept terms and conditions or agree to a privacy policy on the first run
*   Performing initial setup or configuration tasks on the first run

# Tutorial: Using the Palestine First Run Flutter Package
=====================================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To use the `palestine_first_run` package, you need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:

```yml
dependencies:
  palestine_first_run: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to get the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

To use the package, you need to import it in your Dart file. Add the following line at the top of your file:

```dart
import 'package:palestine_first_run/palestine_first_run.dart';
```

### Step 3: Check if the App is Running for the First Time

To check if the app is running for the first time, you can use the `isFirstRun` function provided by the package. Here's an example:

```dart
bool isFirstRun = await PalestineFirstRun.isFirstRun();
if (isFirstRun) {
  // Perform actions or display content for the first run
} else {
  // Perform actions or display content for subsequent runs
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

The `palestine_first_run` package uses the `shared_preferences` package to store a flag indicating whether the app has run before. This flag is stored in the app's shared preferences, which are specific to each platform.

On Android, the shared preferences are stored in the app's internal storage, while on iOS, they are stored in the app's sandboxed file system.

### Required Configurations or Optimizations

There are no specific configurations or optimizations required to use the `palestine_first_run` package. However, you may want to consider the following:

*   Make sure to handle the case where the user clears the app's data or uninstalls and reinstalls the app. In this case, the `isFirstRun` function will return `true` again.
*   If you need to perform specific actions or display certain content only on the first run, make sure to check the `isFirstRun` flag before doing so.

                  ? 'This is the first run of the app!'
                  : 'This is not the first run of the app.',
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by running the main function, which creates a new instance of the MyApp widget.
// The MyApp widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a theme.
// The home of the MaterialApp is set to the MyHomePage widget.
// The MyHomePage widget is a stateful widget that checks if the app is running for the first time in its initState method.
// The _checkIsFirstRun function checks if the app is running for the first time using the PalestineFirstRun.isFirstRun function.
// The result is stored in the _isFirstRun variable and used to display a message on the screen.
// If the app is running for the first time, the message 'This is the first run of the app!' is displayed.
// If the app is not running for the first time, the message 'This is not the first run of the app.' is displayed.
