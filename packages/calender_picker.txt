# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Calendar Picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `calendar_picker` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `calendar_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  calendar_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode, and ensure that the project settings are configured to support Swift.

## Step 3: Using the Calendar Picker

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple Flutter application that uses the `calendar_picker`. Below is a basic example of how to implement the calendar picker in your app.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:calendar_picker/calendar_picker.dart'; // Import the calendar_picker package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Calendar Picker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: CalendarHome(), // Set the home widget to CalendarHome
    );
  }
}

class CalendarHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CalendarHomeState createState() => _CalendarHomeState();
}

class _CalendarHomeState extends State<CalendarHome> {
  DateTime? selectedDate; // Variable to hold the selected date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Calendar Picker Example')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              selectedDate == null
                  ? 'No date selected!'
                  : 'Selected Date: ${selectedDate!.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0], // Display selected date
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _selectDate(context), // Button to open the calendar picker
              child: Text('Select Date'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to open the calendar picker
  Future<void> _selectDate(BuildContext context) async {
    final DateTime? picked = await showDialog<DateTime>(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
        return CalendarPicker(
          initialDate: selectedDate ?? DateTime.now(), // Set initial date
          firstDate: DateTime(2000), // Set the first selectable date
          lastDate: DateTime(2101), // Set the last selectable date
        );
      },
    );

    if (picked != null && picked != selectedDate) {
      setState(() {
        selectedDate = picked; // Update the selected date
      });
    }
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the calendar_picker package.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The `CalendarHome` widget is a stateful widget that manages the selected date.
// 4. Inside the `CalendarHome`, we have a Text widget to display the selected date and a button to open the calendar picker.
// 5. The `_selectDate` function opens the calendar picker dialog, allowing the user to select a date.
// 6. When a date is picked, it updates the state to reflect the selected date, which is then displayed on the screen.

Overall, this application flow allows users to select a date from a calendar, and the selected date is displayed on the main screen. The use of the `calendar_picker` package simplifies the date selection process, providing a clean and intuitive interface for users.
