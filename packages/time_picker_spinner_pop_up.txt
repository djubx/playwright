# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `time_picker_spinner_pop_up`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `time_picker_spinner_pop_up` package in a Flutter project. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  time_picker_spinner_pop_up: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:time_picker_spinner_pop_up/time_picker_spinner_pop_up.dart';
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

#### Android

Ensure your `AndroidManifest.xml` includes the necessary permissions if your app requires them. Typically, no special permissions are needed for a time picker.

#### iOS

Make sure your `Info.plist` is configured correctly. Again, no special configurations are usually required for a time picker.

### Step 4: Using the Package

To use the `time_picker_spinner_pop_up`, you can integrate it into your widget tree as follows:

```dart
RealFlutter(
  child: TimePickerSpinnerPopUp(
    onTimeChange: (time) {
      // Handle the time change
    },
  ),
);
```

```dart

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Time Picker Spinner Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: TimePickerDemo(),
    );

class TimePickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {

}

class _TimePickerDemoState extends State<TimePickerDemo> {
  TimeOfDay _selectedTime = TimeOfDay.now();

  // This method is called when the user selects a time
  void _onTimeChanged(TimeOfDay time) {
    setState(() {
      _selectedTime = time;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {

              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            TimePickerSpinnerPopUp(
              mode: CupertinoDatePickerMode.time,
              onTimeChange: _onTimeChanged,
              initialTime: _selectedTime,
              // Customize the spinner appearance
              spinnerTextStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 18, color: Colors.black),
              // Customize the pop-up dialog appearance
              dialogStyle: DialogStyle(
                backgroundColor: Colors.white,
                elevation: 5,
                shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
                  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts with the `main` function, which calls `runApp` with `RealFlutter`.
// `RealFlutter` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The home of the app is `TimePickerDemo`, a stateful widget managing the selected time.
// `_TimePickerDemoState` holds the current selected time and updates it when the user picks a new time.
// The `build` method of `_TimePickerDemoState` constructs the UI, displaying the selected time and a button to open the time picker.
// `TimePickerSpinnerPopUp` is used to show a time picker dialog, and it updates the state when a new time is selected.
