# Draggable Menu Flutter Package

The **draggable_menu** Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to create customizable and interactive draggable menus in their Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require a dynamic user interface, where users can interact with menus by dragging them around the screen. 

## When to Use This Package
- **Customizable Menus**: When you need a menu that can be repositioned by the user, enhancing the interactivity of your app.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Draggable Menu Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the draggable_menu package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  draggable_menu: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:draggable_menu/draggable_menu.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Configuration
### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires specific functionalities. However, for basic usage of draggable_menu, no additional configurations are typically required.

## Step 5: Using the Draggable Menu
You can now use the draggable menu in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:draggable_menu/draggable_menu.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Draggable Menu Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: DraggableMenu(
            items: [
              MenuItem(title: 'Item 1', onTap: () => print('Item 1 tapped')),
              MenuItem(title: 'Item 2', onTap: () => print('Item 2 tapped')),
              MenuItem(title: 'Item 3', onTap: () => print('Item 3 tapped')),
            ],
            initialPosition: Offset(100, 100), // Starting position of the menu
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple draggable menu with three items. Each item has an `onTap` callback that prints a message to the console when tapped.

# Complete Example of Draggable Menu

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:draggable_menu/draggable_menu.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Draggable Menu Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: DraggableMenu(
            items: [
              // Define menu items with titles and actions
              MenuItem(title: 'Item 1', onTap: () => print('Item 1 tapped')),
              MenuItem(title: 'Item 2', onTap: () => print('Item 2 tapped')),
              MenuItem(title: 'Item 3', onTap: () => print('Item 3 tapped')),
            ],
            initialPosition: Offset(100, 100), // Set the initial position of the menu
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function is the entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function calls runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a DraggableMenu is created with three items.
// 4. Each menu item has a title and an onTap callback that prints a message to the console when tapped.
// 5. The initial position of the menu is set to (100, 100) on the screen, allowing users to drag it around.
```
