void main() {
  // Initialize Chargebee with your site and API key
  ChargebeeFlutter.initialize(
    site: 'your_chargebee_site',

      title: 'Chargebee Flutter Example',
      home: SubscriptionPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SubscriptionPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SubscriptionPageState createState() => _SubscriptionPageState();
}

class _SubscriptionPageState extends State<SubscriptionPage> {
  // Variable to hold subscription details
  String subscriptionDetails = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch subscription details when the page loads
    fetchSubscription();
  }

  // Function to fetch subscription details
  void fetchSubscription() async {
    try {
      // Call Chargebee API to get subscription details
      var response = await ChargebeeFlutter.getSubscription('subscription_id');
      setState(() {
        subscriptionDetails = response.toString(); // Update state with subscription details
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors
      setState(() {
        subscriptionDetails = 'Error fetching subscription: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chargebee Subscription'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(subscriptionDetails), // Display subscription details
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Logic to create a new subscription can be added here
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing Chargebee with the provided site and API key.
// 2. The main widget is a MaterialApp that sets the home to SubscriptionPage.
// 3. In SubscriptionPage, we fetch subscription details in the initState method.
// 4. The fetchSubscription method calls the Chargebee API to get subscription details.
// 5. If successful, the subscription details are displayed on the screen.
// 6. If there's an error, an error message is shown instead.
// 7. A floating action button is provided for future subscription creation logic.
