        child: Shimmer(
          duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the shimmer effect
          interval: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Interval between shimmer effects
          color: Colors.grey[300]!, // Base color of the shimmer
          child: Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.white, // Background color of the container

              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Shimmer effect for an image placeholder
              Shimmer(
                duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
                interval: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
                color: Colors.grey[300]!,
                child: Container(
                  width: 100,
                  height: 100,
                  color: Colors.white,

        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. The home widget is a Scaffold that contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to stack the shimmer effects vertically.
// 5. The first Shimmer widget creates a shimmering effect for a text placeholder.
// 6. The second Shimmer widget creates a shimmering effect for an image placeholder.
// 7. Each shimmer effect has a defined duration and interval, creating a smooth loading animation.
