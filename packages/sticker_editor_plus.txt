# Complete Example of Sticker Editor Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sticker_editor_plus/sticker_editor_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sticker Editor Plus Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: StickerEditorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class StickerEditorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StickerEditorScreenState createState() => _StickerEditorScreenState();
}

class _StickerEditorScreenState extends State<StickerEditorScreen> {
  // Initialize the StickerEditorController
  final StickerEditorController _controller = StickerEditorController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sticker Editor'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.save),
            onPressed: () {
              // Save the edited sticker
              _controller.saveSticker().then((value) {
                // Handle the saved sticker
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Sticker saved!')),
                );
              });
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: StickerEditor(
          controller: _controller,
          onStickerAdded: (sticker) {
            // Handle sticker addition
            print('Sticker added: ${sticker.id}');
          },
          onStickerRemoved: (sticker) {
            // Handle sticker removal
            print('Sticker removed: ${sticker.id}');
          },
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Add a new sticker
          _controller.addSticker(Sticker.fromImage('path/to/image.png'));
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to StickerEditorScreen, which contains the sticker editor.
// 4. The StickerEditorScreen initializes a StickerEditorController to manage stickers.
// 5. The AppBar includes a save button that saves the edited sticker when pressed.
// 6. The body contains the StickerEditor widget, which displays the sticker editing interface.
// 7. A FloatingActionButton allows users to add a new sticker by providing an image path.
// 8. The onStickerAdded and onStickerRemoved callbacks handle sticker management events.
