# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Link Text Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **link_text** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  link_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` to allow for external links. Add the following lines to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>http</string>
    <string>https</string>
</array>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:link_text/link_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Link Text Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: LinkText(
            text: 'Visit Flutter at https://flutter.dev or email us at info@example.com',
            linkStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            onLinkTap: (link) {
              // Handle link tap
              print('Tapped on link: $link');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() => runApp(RealFlutter());
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a clickable text with links. The `onLinkTap` callback is triggered when a link is tapped.

# Complete Example of the Link Text Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:link_text/link_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Link Text Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: LinkText(
            text: 'Visit Flutter at https://flutter.dev or email us at info@example.com',
            linkStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            onLinkTap: (link) {
              // Handle link tap
              print('Tapped on link: $link');
              // Here you can add logic to open the link in a browser or perform other actions
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() => runApp(RealFlutter());

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which is the root of the application.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, providing a structure for the app with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child, which is a LinkText widget.
// 5. The LinkText widget displays a string with clickable links. The text includes a URL and an email address.
// 6. The linkStyle property customizes the appearance of the links, making them blue and bold.
// 7. The onLinkTap callback is triggered when a link is tapped, allowing you to handle the action (e.g., opening a browser).
// 8. The application runs and displays the clickable text, enhancing user interaction.
```

In summary, the **link_text** package provides a straightforward way to create interactive text in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, you can easily integrate clickable links into your app, enhancing user engagement and functionality.
