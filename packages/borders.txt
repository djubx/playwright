**Setting Up the Borders Package**
---------------------------------

To use the Borders package in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  borders: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:borders/borders.dart';
```
**Using the Borders Package**
---------------------------

To use the Borders package, simply wrap your widget with the `Border` widget:
```dart
Border(
  child: Text('Hello World'),
  border: BorderSide(
    width: 2,
    color: Colors.blue,
  ),
)
```
This will add a blue border with a width of 2 pixels to the `Text` widget.

**Platform-Specific Details**
---------------------------

The Borders package is compatible with both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details to keep in mind:

* On Android, the border is drawn using the `Canvas` class.
* On iOS, the border is drawn using the `CALayer` class.

**Configurations and Optimizations**
-----------------------------------

To optimize the performance of the Borders package, you can use the following configurations:

* Use the `cache` property to cache the border drawing.
* Use the `clip` property to clip the border to the widget's bounds.

import 'package:borders/borders.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Borders Package Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Borders Package Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Add a border to a Text widget
              Border(
                child: Text('Hello World'),
                border: BorderSide(
                  width: 2,
                  color: Colors.blue,
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Add a border to a Button widget
              Border(
                child: ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {},
                  child: Text('Click Me'),
                ),
                border: BorderSide(
                  width: 2,
                  color: Colors.red,
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Add a border to a CircleAvatar widget
              Border(
                child: CircleAvatar(
                  radius: 50,
                  backgroundImage: NetworkImage('https://picsum.photos/200/300'),
                ),
                border: BorderSide(
                  width: 2,
                  color: Colors.green,
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 2. The Center widget contains a Column widget with three children: a Text widget, a Button widget, and a CircleAvatar widget.
// 3. Each child widget is wrapped with a Border widget, which adds a border to the widget.
// 4. The border is customizable and can be changed by modifying the BorderSide properties.
// 5. The user can interact with the widgets as usual, and the borders will remain visible.

// Final summary: The code flows by first creating a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// The Center widget contains a Column widget with three children, each wrapped with a Border widget.
// The Border widget adds a customizable border to each child widget.
