# Collection Ext Flutter Package
=====================================

The `collection_ext` Flutter package provides a set of extensions for working with collections in Dart. It offers a range of features that can simplify and improve the performance of your code when working with collections.

## When to Use
--------------

You should consider using the `collection_ext` package in the following scenarios:

*   When you need to perform complex operations on collections, such as filtering, sorting, or grouping.
*   When you want to improve the performance of your code by using optimized collection algorithms.
*   When you need to work with large datasets and want to take advantage of lazy loading and other performance optimizations.

## Features
------------

The `collection_ext` package offers the following features:

*   **Extensions for Iterable, List, Set, and Map**: The package provides a range of extensions for working with different types of collections, including `Iterable`, `List`, `Set`, and `Map`.
*   **Filtering and Sorting**: The package offers methods for filtering and sorting collections, including `where`, `whereNot`, `sortBy`, and `sortByDescending`.
*   **Grouping and Partitioning**: The package provides methods for grouping and partitioning collections, including `groupBy`, `partition`, and `splitWhen`.
*   **Lazy Loading**: The package offers support for lazy loading, allowing you to load data only when it is needed.

# Tutorial: Using the Collection Ext Package
=============================================

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project
-----------------------------------------

To use the `collection_ext` package, you need to add it to your project. You can do this by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  collection_ext: ^1.0.0
```

## Step 2: Import the Package
---------------------------

Once you have added the package to your project, you need to import it in your Dart file. You can do this by adding the following line at the top of your file:

```dart
import 'package:collection_ext/collection_ext.dart';
```

## Step 3: Use the Package
-------------------------

Now you can use the `collection_ext` package in your code. Here is an example of how you can use the `where` method to filter a list:

```dart
void main() {
  List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  List<int> evenNumbers = numbers.where((number) => number % 2 == 0).toList();
  print(evenNumbers); // prints [2, 4]
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details
---------------------------

The `collection_ext` package works on all platforms supported by Flutter, including Android, iOS, and web.

```dart
// Import the collection_ext package
import 'package:collection_ext/collection_ext.dart';

// Define the RealFlutter class
class RealFlutter {
  // Define a method to demonstrate the where method
  void demonstrateWhereMethod() {
    // Create a list of numbers
    List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
    // Use the where method to filter the list
    List<int> evenNumbers = numbers.where((number) => number % 2 == 0).toList();
    
    // Print the result
    print(evenNumbers); // prints [2, 4]
  }
  
  // Define a method to demonstrate the sortBy method
  void demonstrateSortByMethod() {
    // Create a list of numbers
    List<int> numbers = [4, 2, 5, 1, 3];
    
    // Use the sortBy method to sort the list
    List<int> sortedNumbers = numbers.sortBy((number) => number).toList();
    
    // Print the result
    print(sortedNumbers); // prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  }
  
  // Define a method to demonstrate the groupBy method
  void demonstrateGroupByMethod() {
    // Create a list of numbers
    List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
    // Use the groupBy method to group the list
    Map<int, List<int>> groupedNumbers = numbers.groupBy((number) => number % 2);
    
    // Print the result
    print(groupedNumbers); // prints {1: [1, 3, 5], 0: [2, 4]}
  }
}

// Create an instance of the RealFlutter class
void main() {
  RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();
  
  // Call the methods to demonstrate the collection_ext package
  realFlutter.demonstrateWhereMethod();
  realFlutter.demonstrateSortByMethod();
  realFlutter.demonstrateGroupByMethod();
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The RealFlutter class is defined with methods to demonstrate the where, sortBy, and groupBy methods.
// 2. An instance of the RealFlutter class is created in the main method.
// 3. The methods to demonstrate the collection_ext package are called on the instance of the RealFlutter class.
// 4. The results are printed to the console.
