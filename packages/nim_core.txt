# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `nim_core`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `nim_core` package and demonstrate how to use its features in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding Dependency

To get started, add the `nim_core` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  nim_core: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for voice calls.</string>
```

## Step 3: Initializing the Package

In your main Dart file, initialize the `nim_core` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nim_core/nim_core.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'NIM Core Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the features of the `nim_core` package in your application. For example, to send a message:

```dart
void sendMessage(String message) {
  NimCore.sendMessage(message);
}
```

This function can be called from a button press or any other event in your application.

# Complete Example of `nim_core` in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nim_core/nim_core.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'NIM Core Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  List<String> messages = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('NIM Core Chat'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: messages.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(messages[index]),
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
            child: Row(
              children: [
                Expanded(
                  child: TextField(
                    controller: _controller,
                    decoration: InputDecoration(hintText: 'Type a message'),
                  ),
                ),
                IconButton(
                  icon: Icon(Icons.send),
                  onPressed: () {
                    sendMessage(_controller.text);
                    _controller.clear(); // Clear the input field
                  },
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  void sendMessage(String message) {
    // Send the message using nim_core
    NimCore.sendMessage(message);
    // Add the message to the local list for display
    setState(() {
      messages.add(message);
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp and sets the HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget maintains a list of messages and a TextEditingController for the input field.
// 4. The UI consists of a ListView to display messages and a TextField for user input.
// 5. When the send button is pressed, the sendMessage function is called, which sends the message using nim_core and updates the local message list.
// 6. The UI updates to reflect the new message in the chat.
```
