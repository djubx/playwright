# Exploring the "dateable" Flutter Package

The **dateable** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to manage and manipulate dates and times effectively. It provides a simple and intuitive API for handling date-related functionalities, making it easier to work with date formats, calculations, and comparisons. 

## When to Use "dateable"

You might consider using the **dateable** package in scenarios such as:
- Building applications that require date selection and manipulation, like calendars or event planners.
- Implementing features that involve date comparisons, such as deadlines or expiration dates.
- Formatting dates for display in various locales and formats.

## Key Features

- **Date Manipulation**: Easily add or subtract days, months, or years from a given date.
- **Date Formatting**: Format dates into various string representations based on user locale or preferences.
- **Comparison Utilities**: Compare two dates to determine which is earlier, later, or if they are the same.
- **Time Zone Support**: Handle dates across different time zones seamlessly.

With these features, **dateable** simplifies the complexities often associated with date handling in Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the "dateable" Package

## Installation

To get started with the **dateable** package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dateable: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to handle any specific permissions related to date and time access, although the **dateable** package itself does not require special permissions.

## Basic Usage

Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to manipulate and format dates using **dateable**.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dateable/dateable.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: DateableExample(),
    );
  }
}

class DateableExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a date object for today
    DateTime today = DateTime.now();
    
    // Add 5 days to today's date
    DateTime futureDate = today.add(Duration(days: 5));
    
    // Format the future date
    String formattedDate = Dateable.format(futureDate, format: 'yyyy-MM-dd');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dateable Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Future Date: $formattedDate'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a date 5 days from today, formatted as `yyyy-MM-dd`.

# Complete Example of Using the "dateable" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dateable/dateable.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: DateableExample(),
    );
  }
}

class DateableExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a date object for today
    DateTime today = DateTime.now();
    
    // Add 5 days to today's date
    DateTime futureDate = today.add(Duration(days: 5));
    
    // Format the future date
    String formattedDate = Dateable.format(futureDate, format: 'yyyy-MM-dd');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dateable Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Future Date: $formattedDate'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp and sets DateableExample as the home widget.
// 3. In DateableExample, we create a DateTime object representing the current date and time.
// 4. We then add 5 days to the current date using the add method.
// 5. The future date is formatted into a string using the Dateable.format method with the specified format.
// 6. Finally, the formatted future date is displayed in the center of the screen within a Text widget.
