// This is the main entry point of the application.
// The MyApp widget is created and run using the runApp function.

// The MyApp widget is a stateless widget that returns a MaterialApp.
// The MaterialApp has a title, theme, and home property.
// The home property is set to the RealFlutter widget.

// The RealFlutter widget is a stateful widget that has a DateTime property called _date.
// The _date property is initialized to the current date and time.

// The build method of the RealFlutter widget returns a Scaffold.
// The Scaffold has an appBar, body, and floatingActionButton property.
// The appBar property is set to an AppBar with a title.
// The body property is set to a Center widget with a Column child.
// The Column has three children: a Text widget, a Text widget, and an ElevatedButton.

// The first Text widget displays the text "Selected Date:".
// The second Text widget displays the formatted date string using the dateable package.
// The ElevatedButton has an onPressed property that calls the _selectDate function when pressed.

// The _selectDate function is an async function that shows a DatePicker.
// The DatePicker has an initialDate, firstDate, and lastDate property.
// The initialDate property is set to the _date property.
// The firstDate property is set to a DateTime object representing the year 2020.
// The lastDate property is set to a DateTime object representing the year 2025.

// When the user selects a date using the DatePicker, the _date property is updated.
// The setState function is called to rebuild the widget tree.

// This is the end of the application flow.
