## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Using the Package

Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use an icon from the `iconoir_flutter` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iconoir_flutter/iconoir_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Iconoir Flutter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: IconoirIcons.home, // Using an icon from the package
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the `iconoir_flutter` package and use one of its icons in a simple Flutter application. You can replace `IconoirIcons.home` with any other icon from the package.

# Complete Example of iconoir_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iconoir_flutter/iconoir_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Iconoir Flutter Demo', // Title of the application
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue, // Primary color theme
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Iconoir Flutter Example'), // AppBar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Centering the column
            children: <Widget>[
              IconoirIcons.home, // Displaying the home icon
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              IconoirIcons.settings, // Displaying the settings icon
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              IconoirIcons.user, // Displaying the user icon
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which is the root of the application.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, we define the theme and home widget (Scaffold).
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with a title and a body that centers a column of icons.
// 5. The column displays three icons (home, settings, user) from the iconoir_flutter package, with spacing in between.
```
