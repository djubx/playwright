## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_custom_month_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml

```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the month picker.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_custom_month_picker/flutter_custom_month_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom Month Picker Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MonthPickerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class MonthPickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MonthPickerDemoState createState() => _MonthPickerDemoState();
}

class _MonthPickerDemoState extends State<MonthPickerDemo> {
  // Variable to hold the selected month and year
  DateTime? selectedDate;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Custom Month Picker'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected month and year
            Text(
              selectedDate == null
                  ? 'No Month Selected'
                  : 'Selected Month: ${selectedDate!.month}/${selectedDate!.year}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open the month picker
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Show the month picker dialog
                showMonthPicker(
                  context: context,
                  initialDate: selectedDate ?? DateTime.now(),
                  firstDate: DateTime(2000),
                  lastDate: DateTime(2100),
                ).then((date) {
                  // Update the selected date when a date is picked
                  if (date != null) {
                    setState(() {
                      selectedDate = date;
                    });
                  }
                });
              },
              child: Text('Pick a Month'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the flutter_custom_month_picker package.
// 
// 1. **Main Function**: The entry point of the application, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. **RealFlutter Class**: A StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. **MonthPickerDemo Class**: A StatefulWidget that manages the state of the selected month and year.
// 4. **State Management**: The selectedDate variable holds the currently selected month and year.
// 5. **UI Layout**: The UI consists of a Text widget to display the selected month and a button to open the month picker.
// 6. **Month Picker Dialog**: When the button is pressed, the month picker dialog is shown, allowing the user to select a month and year.
// 7. **Updating State**: Once a date is selected, the state is updated to reflect the new selection, and the UI is rebuilt to show the selected month and year.

In summary, this application allows users to select a month and year using a custom month picker. The selected date is displayed on the screen, providing a clear and user-friendly interface for date selection.
