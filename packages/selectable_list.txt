# Selectable List Flutter Package

The `selectable_list` package is a powerful Flutter library that allows developers to create lists with selectable items. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where users need to select multiple items from a list, such as in settings, forms, or any application that requires user input from a list of options.

## When to Use

You might consider using the `selectable_list` package in the following scenarios:
- Creating a multi-select dropdown for user preferences.
- Building a checklist for tasks or items.
- Implementing a selection interface for filtering data.

## Features

- **Multi-Selection**: Allows users to select multiple items from a list.
- **Customizable UI**: Provides options to customize the appearance of the list and its items.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications.
- **State Management**: Built-in support for managing the selection state of items.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Selectable List

## Installation

To use the `selectable_list` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  selectable_list: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities.

## Basic Usage

To use the `selectable_list` package, you can create a simple Flutter widget that utilizes the `SelectableList` widget provided by the package. Below is a basic example of how to implement it.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:selectable_list/selectable_list.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Selectable List Example')),
        body: SelectableList(
          items: [
            'Item 1',
            'Item 2',
            'Item 3',
            'Item 4',
          ],
          onSelectionChanged: (selectedItems) {
            // Handle the selection change
            print('Selected items: $selectedItems');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple selectable list with four items. The `onSelectionChanged` callback is triggered whenever the selection changes, allowing you to handle the selected items accordingly.

# Complete Example of Selectable List

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:selectable_list/selectable_list.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Selectable List Example')),
        body: SelectableList(
          items: [
            'Item 1', // First item in the list
            'Item 2', // Second item in the list
            'Item 3', // Third item in the list
            'Item 4', // Fourth item in the list
          ],
          onSelectionChanged: (selectedItems) {
            // This callback is triggered when the selection changes
            // Here we print the selected items to the console
            print('Selected items: $selectedItems');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter widget
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
3. The body contains a SelectableList widget, which displays a list of items.
4. Users can select items from the list, and the onSelectionChanged callback is triggered whenever the selection changes.
5. The selected items are printed to the console, allowing developers to see the current selection.
