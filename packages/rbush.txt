# Overview of the rbush Flutter Package

The `rbush` package is a high-performance spatial index for 2D rectangles, designed to efficiently store and query spatial data. It is particularly useful in applications that require fast access to spatial information, such as mapping, game development, and any scenario where you need to manage a large number of rectangles.

## When to Use rbush
- **Geospatial Applications**: When you need to manage geographical data, such as points on a map.
- **Game Development**: For collision detection between game objects.
- **Data Visualization**: When rendering large datasets that require efficient querying.

## Key Features
- **Fast Insertion and Deletion**: Efficiently add and remove rectangles from the index.
- **Spatial Queries**: Quickly find all rectangles that intersect with a given rectangle.
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, ensuring that it does not bloat your application.

The `rbush` package is a powerful tool for any Flutter developer looking to manage spatial data efficiently.

# Setting Up and Using rbush in Flutter

## Installation
To add the `rbush` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rbush: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
The `rbush` package is platform-agnostic, meaning it works seamlessly on both Android and iOS without any additional configuration. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

## Basic Usage
To use the `rbush` package, you will typically follow these steps:

1. **Import the Package**:
   ```dart
   import 'package:rbush/rbush.dart';
   ```

2. **Create an Instance of the rbush**:
   ```dart
   final rbush = RBush<int>();
   ```

3. **Insert Rectangles**:
   ```dart
   rbush.insert(Rectangle(0, 0, 10, 10), 1); // Insert a rectangle with ID 1
   ```

4. **Query for Intersections**:
   ```dart
   final results = rbush.search(Rectangle(5, 5, 15, 15)); // Query for intersecting rectangles
   ```

5. **Remove Rectangles**:
   ```dart
   rbush.remove(Rectangle(0, 0, 10, 10), 1); // Remove the rectangle with ID 1
   ```

This basic setup allows you to manage and query spatial data efficiently in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using rbush in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rbush/rbush.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'RBush Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('RBush Spatial Index Example'),
        ),
        body: SpatialIndexDemo(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SpatialIndexDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SpatialIndexDemoState createState() => _SpatialIndexDemoState();
}

class _SpatialIndexDemoState extends State<SpatialIndexDemo> {
  final RBush<int> rbush = RBush<int>(); // Create an instance of RBush
  List<Rectangle> rectangles = []; // List to hold rectangles

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Insert some rectangles into the rbush
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      final rect = Rectangle(i * 10.0, i * 10.0, 10.0, 10.0);
      rbush.insert(rect, i); // Insert rectangle with ID i
      rectangles.add(rect); // Add to the list for display
    }
  }

  void _search() {
    // Perform a search for rectangles that intersect with a given rectangle
    final searchRect = Rectangle(5, 5, 15, 15);
    final results = rbush.search(searchRect); // Query for intersecting rectangles
    print('Intersecting rectangles: $results'); // Print results to console
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _search, // Trigger search on button press
          child: Text('Search for Intersections'),
        ),
        Expanded(
          child: CustomPaint(
            painter: RectanglePainter(rectangles), // Custom painter to draw rectangles
            child: Container(),
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Custom painter to visualize rectangles
class RectanglePainter extends CustomPainter {
  final List<Rectangle> rectangles;

  RectanglePainter(this.rectangles);

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final paint = Paint()
      ..color = Colors.blue
      ..style = PaintingStyle.fill;

    for (var rect in rectangles) {
      canvas.drawRect(
        Rect.fromLTWH(rect.x, rect.y, rect.width, rect.height),
        paint, // Draw each rectangle
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return true; // Always repaint
  }
}
```

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and the main UI.
// Inside the SpatialIndexDemo stateful widget, we create an instance of RBush to manage our rectangles.
// In initState, we populate the rbush with 10 rectangles, each with a unique ID.
// The _search method queries the rbush for rectangles that intersect with a specified rectangle and prints the results.
// The build method creates a button to trigger the search and a CustomPaint widget to visualize the rectangles.
// The RectanglePainter class is responsible for drawing the rectangles on the canvas.
// Each rectangle is drawn in blue, and the canvas is updated whenever the state changes.
