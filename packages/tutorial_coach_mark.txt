# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Tutorial Coach Mark Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `tutorial_coach_mark` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tutorial_coach_mark: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:tutorial_coach_mark/tutorial_coach_mark.dart';
```

## Step 3: Setting Up the Coach Mark

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can create a `TutorialCoachMark` instance and show it when the app starts or when a specific action occurs. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to set it up:

```dart
void showTutorial(BuildContext context) {
  // Create a list of coach marks
  List<TutorialCoachMark> tutorialCoachMarks = [];

  // Define the coach mark for a specific widget
  tutorialCoachMarks.add(
    TutorialCoachMark(
      targets: [
        TargetFocus(
          identify: "Target 1",
          keyTarget: GlobalKey(), // Use a GlobalKey to identify the widget
          contents: [
            ContentTarget(
              align: AlignContent.top,
              child: Text("This is the first feature!"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ],
      onFinish: () {
        print("Tutorial finished");
      },
    ),
  );

  // Show the tutorial
  TutorialCoachMark.showTutorial(context, tutorialCoachMarks);
}
```

## Step 5: Triggering the Tutorial

You can call the `showTutorial` function in your app's main widget or after a specific user action, such as a button press.

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    showTutorial(context);
  },
  child: Text("Show Tutorial"),
)
```

This setup will allow you to create a guided experience for your users, helping them navigate through your app's features effectively.

# Complete Example of Using the Tutorial Coach Mark Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tutorial_coach_mark/tutorial_coach_mark.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tutorial Coach Mark Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // GlobalKey to identify the widget for the tutorial
  final GlobalKey _targetKey = GlobalKey();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // A button that will trigger the tutorial
            ElevatedButton(
              key: _targetKey, // Assign the key to the button
              onPressed: () {
                showTutorial(context);
              },
              child: Text("Show Tutorial"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to show the tutorial
  void showTutorial(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a list of coach marks
    List<TutorialCoachMark> tutorialCoachMarks = [];

    // Define the coach mark for the button
    tutorialCoachMarks.add(
      TutorialCoachMark(
        targets: [
          TargetFocus(
            identify: "Target 1",
            keyTarget: _targetKey, // Use the GlobalKey to identify the button
            contents: [
              ContentTarget(
                align: AlignContent.top,
                child: Text("This button triggers the tutorial!"),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ],
        onFinish: () {
          print("Tutorial finished");
        },
      ),
    );

    // Show the tutorial
    TutorialCoachMark.showTutorial(context, tutorialCoachMarks);
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a HomeScreen as its home.
// 3. The HomeScreen contains a button that, when pressed, triggers the showTutorial function.
// 4. The showTutorial function creates a list of TutorialCoachMark instances, defining the target widget and the content to display.
// 5. The tutorial is displayed, guiding the user through the app's features.
