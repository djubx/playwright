# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Rocket Package

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_rocket`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_rocket: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement `flutter_rocket` in your app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_rocket/flutter_rocket.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Rocket Demo',
      home: RocketHome(),
    );
  }
}

class RocketHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Rocket Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to Flutter Rocket!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that utilizes the `flutter_rocket` package. You can expand upon this by incorporating more features from the package as needed.

# Complete Example of Flutter Rocket in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_rocket/flutter_rocket.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Rocket Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RocketHome(),
    );
  }
}

class RocketHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RocketHomeState createState() => _RocketHomeState();
}

class _RocketHomeState extends State<RocketHome> {
  // State variable to hold the count
  int _counter = 0;

  // Method to increment the counter
  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++; // Increment the counter
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Rocket Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            Text(
              '$_counter', // Display the counter value
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter, // Call increment method on press
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: Icon(Icons.add), // Icon for the button
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RocketHome, which is a StatefulWidget.
4. In RocketHome, a state variable _counter is initialized to 0.
5. The _incrementCounter method updates the state by incrementing _counter.
6. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the current count and a button.
7. When the FloatingActionButton is pressed, it calls _incrementCounter, updating the UI with the new count.
