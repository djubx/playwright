# Setting Up the Flutter Stripe Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_stripe` package, including platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_stripe` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_stripe: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_stripe).

## Step 2: Configure for Android

1. **Update Android Manifest**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Add Stripe API Key**: In the same file, add your Stripe publishable key in the `application` tag:

   ```xml
   <meta-data
       android:name="com.stripe.apiKey"
       android:value="your_publishable_key"/>
   ```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Add Stripe API Key**: Add your Stripe publishable key in the `Info.plist`:

   ```xml
   <key>StripePublishableKey</key>
   <string>your_publishable_key</string>
   ```

## Step 4: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, initialize the Stripe package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_stripe/flutter_stripe.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  Stripe.publishableKey = 'your_publishable_key';
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Create Payment Methods

You can now create payment methods using the `flutter_stripe` package. Refer to the official documentation for detailed examples on creating payment intents and handling transactions.

By following these steps, you will have successfully set up the `flutter_stripe` package in your Flutter application, ready to handle payments securely and efficiently.

# Complete Example of Using Flutter Stripe

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_stripe/flutter_stripe.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize Stripe with your publishable key
  Stripe.publishableKey = 'your_publishable_key';
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Stripe Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  // Function to handle payment
  Future<void> _handlePayment() async {
    try {
      // Create a payment method
      final paymentMethod = await Stripe.instance.createPaymentMethod(
        PaymentMethodParams.card(
          // Collect card details from user input
          billingDetails: BillingDetails(
            email: 'email@example.com',
            phone: '+1234567890',
            name: 'John Doe',
          ),
        ),
      );

      // Here you would typically send the paymentMethod.id to your server
      // to create a payment intent and confirm the payment.

      // For demonstration, we will just print the payment method ID
      print('Payment Method ID: ${paymentMethod.id}');
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle error
      print('Error: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Stripe Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _handlePayment,
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app initializes and sets the Stripe publishable key.
// 2. The main widget, RealFlutter, builds the MaterialApp and sets the home to PaymentScreen.
// 3. In PaymentScreen, when the user taps the "Pay Now" button, the _handlePayment function is called.
// 4. Inside _handlePayment, a payment method is created using the card details.
// 5. The payment method ID is printed to the console, which can be sent to the server for further processing.
```
