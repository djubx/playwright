# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Floating Menu Panel

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **floating_menu_panel** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  floating_menu_panel: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:floating_menu_panel/floating_menu_panel.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup
To use the floating menu panel, you need to create a `FloatingMenuPanel` widget. Here’s a basic setup:

```dart
FloatingMenuPanel(
  items: [
    FloatingMenuItem(
      icon: Icons.add,
      label: 'Add',
      onTap: () {
        // Handle add action
      },
    ),
    FloatingMenuItem(
      icon: Icons.edit,
      label: 'Edit',
      onTap: () {
        // Handle edit action
      },
    ),
  ],
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if your menu actions require them (e.g., internet access).

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to adjust the `Info.plist` file to include any required permissions, especially if your menu actions involve accessing device features.

## Step 4: Customization
You can customize the appearance of the floating menu by modifying properties such as `backgroundColor`, `iconColor`, and `labelColor`. Here’s an example:

```dart
FloatingMenuPanel(
  backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
  iconColor: Colors.white,
  labelColor: Colors.white,
  items: [
    // Menu items as shown above
  ],
)
```

## Step 5: Testing
Run your application on both Android and iOS devices to ensure that the floating menu behaves as expected and is responsive to different screen sizes.

# Complete Example of Floating Menu Panel

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:floating_menu_panel/floating_menu_panel.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Floating Menu Panel Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Floating Menu Panel Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Press the floating menu button!'),
        ),
        // Adding the FloatingMenuPanel to the Scaffold
        floatingActionButton: FloatingMenuPanel(
          items: [
            FloatingMenuItem(
              icon: Icons.add,
              label: 'Add',
              onTap: () {
                // Handle add action
                print('Add action tapped');
              },
            ),
            FloatingMenuItem(
              icon: Icons.edit,
              label: 'Edit',
              onTap: () {
                // Handle edit action
                print('Edit action tapped');
              },
            ),
            FloatingMenuItem(
              icon: Icons.delete,
              label: 'Delete',
              onTap: () {
                // Handle delete action
                print('Delete action tapped');
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget displaying a message.
// 4. The FloatingMenuPanel is added as a floating action button, containing three menu items: Add, Edit, and Delete.
// 5. Each menu item has an onTap callback that prints a message to the console when tapped, demonstrating how to handle actions.
```

// Final Summary:
// The application starts by initializing the Flutter framework and setting up a basic UI with an AppBar and a centered message. The floating menu panel is integrated as a floating action button, providing users with quick access to three actions: Add, Edit, and Delete. Each action is linked to a callback that executes when the respective menu item is tapped, showcasing the package's functionality and ease of use.
