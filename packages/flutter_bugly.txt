# flutter_bugly: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_bugly` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_bugly` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_bugly: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <application>
       <meta-data
           android:name="com.tencent.bugly.APPID"
           android:value="YOUR_BUGLY_APP_ID" />
       <meta-data
           android:name="com.tencent.bugly.APPKEY"
           android:value="YOUR_BUGLY_APP_KEY" />
   </application>
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_BUGLY_APP_ID` and `YOUR_BUGLY_APP_KEY` with your actual Bugly credentials.

2. **Enable ProGuard** (optional): If you are using ProGuard, ensure that you add the necessary rules to keep Bugly classes.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Add Bugly SDK**: Follow the instructions on the Bugly website to integrate the Bugly SDK into your iOS project.

## Step 3: Initialize Bugly

In your main Dart file, initialize Bugly in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bugly/flutter_bugly.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Bugly with your App ID
  Bugly.init(androidAppId: "YOUR_BUGLY_APP_ID", iOSAppId: "YOUR_BUGLY_APP_ID");
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using Bugly

You can now use Bugly to log crashes and custom events. Hereâ€™s how to log a crash manually:

```dart
try {
  // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (e) {
  // Log the exception to Bugly
  Bugly.postException(e);
}
```

You can also log custom events:

```dart
Bugly.log("Custom event", "User clicked on button");
```

With these steps, you have successfully integrated `flutter_bugly` into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_bugly

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bugly/flutter_bugly.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Bugly with your App ID
  Bugly.init(androidAppId: "YOUR_BUGLY_APP_ID", iOSAppId: "YOUR_BUGLY_APP_ID");
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Bugly Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Bugly Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Simulate a crash
            throw Exception("This is a simulated crash!");
          },
          child: Text('Simulate Crash'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes Bugly with the provided App ID.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 4. When the user taps the "Simulate Crash" button, an exception is thrown.
// 5. The exception is automatically captured by Bugly, allowing developers to analyze the crash in the Bugly dashboard.
```

// The application starts by initializing Bugly with the provided App ID. 
// The main widget, MyApp, sets up the MaterialApp and displays the HomeScreen.
// The HomeScreen contains a button that, when pressed, simulates a crash by throwing an exception.
// This exception is captured by Bugly, which allows developers to view crash reports and analytics in the Bugly dashboard.
// This flow helps in monitoring app stability and improving user experience by addressing issues promptly.
