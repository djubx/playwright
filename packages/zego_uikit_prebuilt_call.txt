# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `zego_uikit_prebuilt_call`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `zego_uikit_prebuilt_call` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `zego_uikit_prebuilt_call` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  zego_uikit_prebuilt_call: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your app has the necessary permissions. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

Additionally, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to add permissions in the `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`. Add the following entries:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio calls.</string>
```

## Step 4: Initialize the SDK

Before using the package, you need to initialize the ZEGOCLOUD SDK. This is typically done in the `main()` function of your Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zego_uikit_prebuilt_call/zego_uikit_prebuilt_call.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the ZEGOCLOUD SDK with your App ID and App Sign
  ZegoUIKitPrebuiltCall.init(appID: YOUR_APP_ID, appSign: YOUR_APP_SIGN);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Using the Prebuilt Call UI

You can now use the prebuilt call UI in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate a call:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('ZEGOCLOUD Call Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Start a call with a unique room ID
              Navigator.push(
                context,
                MaterialPageRoute(
                  builder: (context) => ZegoUIKitPrebuiltCall(
                    appID: YOUR_APP_ID,
                    appSign: YOUR_APP_SIGN,
                    roomID: 'test_room',
                    userID: 'user_1',
                    userName: 'User 1',
                  ),
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Start Call'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application that allows users to start a call by pressing a button. The `ZegoUIKitPrebuiltCall` widget handles the call interface and functionality.

# Complete Example of Using `zego_uikit_prebuilt_call`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zego_uikit_prebuilt_call/zego_uikit_prebuilt_call.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the ZEGOCLOUD SDK with your App ID and App Sign
  ZegoUIKitPrebuiltCall.init(appID: YOUR_APP_ID, appSign: YOUR_APP_SIGN);
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('ZEGOCLOUD Call Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Start a call with a unique room ID
              Navigator.push(
                context,
                MaterialPageRoute(
                  builder: (context) => ZegoUIKitPrebuiltCall(
                    appID: YOUR_APP_ID,
                    appSign: YOUR_APP_SIGN,
                    roomID: 'test_room', // Unique room ID for the call
                    userID: 'user_1', // Unique user ID for the caller
                    userName: 'User 1', // Display name for the caller
                  ),
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Start Call'), // Button to initiate the call
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing the ZEGOCLOUD SDK with the provided App ID and App Sign.
// 2. The main widget, RealFlutter, builds a simple UI with an AppBar and a centered button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, it navigates to the ZegoUIKitPrebuiltCall widget.
// 4. The ZegoUIKitPrebuiltCall widget takes care of the call interface, allowing users to join the specified room.
// 5. Users can communicate via audio and video in the call, leveraging the features provided by the package.
