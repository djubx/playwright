**Final Summary:**

The `lazy_evaluation` package is a utility library that allows you to lazily evaluate expressions, which can be useful in a variety of scenarios. The package provides a `Lazy` class that delays the evaluation of an expression until its result is actually needed. The package also supports asynchronous computations out of the box.

In the example code, we create a `RealFlutter` class that demonstrates the usage of the `lazy_evaluation` package. We create a `Lazy` instance to delay the evaluation of an expression and use the `value` property to access the result of the computation. The example code also simulates an expensive computation and updates the state to re-evaluate the lazy value.

Overall, the `lazy_evaluation` package is a useful tool for optimizing performance and reducing computational overhead in Flutter applications.
