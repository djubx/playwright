# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Delightful Toast

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **delightful_toast** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  delightful_toast: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to use features that require user permissions. However, for basic toast functionality, no additional configuration is necessary.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display a toast message:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:delightful_toast/delightful_toast.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Delightful Toast Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show a success toast
              DelightfulToast.showToast(
                'Data saved successfully!',
                backgroundColor: Colors.green,
                textColor: Colors.white,
                duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Toast'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a toast message will appear at the bottom of the screen.

                    backgroundColor: Colors.red,

                    duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Show Error Toast'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Show an info toast
                  DelightfulToast.showToast(
                    'This is an info message.',
                    backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
                    textColor: Colors.white,
                    duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Show Info Toast'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds a Column of buttons.
// 4. Each button, when pressed, triggers a toast message using DelightfulToast.showToast().
// 5. The showToast method takes parameters for the message, background color, text color, and duration.
// 6. Depending on the button pressed, different toast messages (success, error, info) are displayed at the bottom of the screen.
