# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_paystack_payment

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_paystack_payment` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_paystack_payment` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_paystack_payment: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, you need to add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

Also, ensure that you have the correct Paystack public key in your application. You can obtain this from your Paystack dashboard.

## Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Initialize Paystack

In your Flutter application, you need to initialize Paystack with your public key. This is typically done in the `main` function or the first screen of your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_paystack_payment/flutter_paystack_payment.dart';

void main() {
  PaystackPlugin.initialize(publicKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY");
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Implement Payment

You can now implement the payment functionality in your app. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate a payment:

```dart
void startPayment() async {
  final charge = Charge()
    ..amount = 10000 // Amount in kobo
    ..email = "customer@example.com"
    ..currency = "NGN";

  final response = await PaystackPlugin.checkout(context,
      charge: charge,
      method: CheckoutMethod.card,
      fullscreen: true);

  if (response.status) {
    // Payment was successful
    print("Payment successful: ${response.reference}");
  } else {
    // Payment failed
    print("Payment failed: ${response.message}");
  }
}
```

## Step 6: Testing

Make sure to test your payment integration thoroughly. Use the test card numbers provided by Paystack to simulate transactions without real money.

# Complete Example of flutter_paystack_payment

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_paystack_payment/flutter_paystack_payment.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Paystack with your public key
  PaystackPlugin.initialize(publicKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY");
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Paystack Payment Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Paystack Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Start the payment process when the button is pressed
            startPayment(context);
          },
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void startPayment(BuildContext context) async {
    // Create a Charge object with the payment details
    final charge = Charge()
      ..amount = 10000 // Amount in kobo (10000 kobo = 100 NGN)
      ..email = "customer@example.com" // Customer's email
      ..currency = "NGN"; // Currency

    // Initiate the checkout process
    final response = await PaystackPlugin.checkout(context,
        charge: charge,
        method: CheckoutMethod.card, // Specify the payment method
        fullscreen: true); // Fullscreen checkout

    // Check the response status
    if (response.status) {
      // Payment was successful
      print("Payment successful: ${response.reference}");
      // You can navigate to a success screen or show a success message
    } else {
      // Payment failed
      print("Payment failed: ${response.message}");
      // You can show an error message to the user
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes Paystack with the public key.
// 2. The main screen displays a button labeled "Pay Now."
// 3. When the button is pressed, the startPayment function is called.
// 4. A Charge object is created with the payment details (amount, email, currency).
// 5. The Paystack checkout process is initiated.
// 6. The user is presented with the payment interface.
// 7. Upon completion, the response is checked for success or failure.
// 8. Based on the response, appropriate actions are taken (e.g., showing messages).
```

// Final Summary:
// The application initializes the Paystack payment gateway with the public key. It presents a simple UI with a button to initiate payment. When the button is pressed, it creates a Charge object with the necessary payment details and calls the Paystack checkout method. The user is then taken to the Paystack payment interface, and upon completion, the app checks the response to determine if the payment was successful or failed, allowing for appropriate user feedback.
