# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Bouncing Button Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **bouncing_button** package, you first need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bouncing_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the bouncing button, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:bouncing_button/bouncing_button.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Bouncing Button

You can now use the `BouncingButton` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
BouncingButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Action to perform on button press
    print("Button Pressed!");
  },
  child: Text("Click Me"),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing the Button

You can customize the button's appearance and animation by using various properties:

```dart
BouncingButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Action to perform on button press
    print("Button Pressed!");
  },
  child: Text("Click Me"),
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 200), // Duration of the bounce effect
  scale: 1.2, // Scale factor for the bounce
  curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Animation curve
)
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate and customize the **bouncing_button** package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Bouncing Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bouncing_button/bouncing_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bouncing Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bouncing Button Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: BouncingButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print("Button Pressed!");
            },
            child: Text("Click Me"),
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 200), // Duration of the bounce effect
            scale: 1.2, // Scale factor for the bounce
