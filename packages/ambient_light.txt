# Ambient Light Flutter Package

The `ambient_light` Flutter package is designed to help developers access the ambient light sensor data on mobile devices. This package is particularly useful for applications that require light level detection, such as adaptive brightness settings, photography apps, or any app that needs to adjust its UI based on the surrounding light conditions.

## When to Use This Package
- **Adaptive UI**: Adjust the brightness or theme of your app based on the ambient light.
- **Photography Apps**: Provide users with information about the light conditions for better photo capturing.
- **Health and Fitness Apps**: Monitor light exposure for wellness applications.

## Features
- Access to real-time ambient light sensor data.
- Simple API for easy integration into Flutter applications.
- Platform support for both Android and iOS.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Ambient Light Package

## Installation
To use the `ambient_light` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ambient_light: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ambient_light).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permission to access the ambient light sensor:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BODY_SENSORS"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, no additional configuration is required, but ensure that your app's deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0.

## Using the Package
To use the `ambient_light` package, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:ambient_light/ambient_light.dart';
```

2. Create a method to listen for ambient light changes:

```dart
void listenToAmbientLight() {
  AmbientLight().lightSensorStream.listen((lightLevel) {
    // Handle the light level data
    print('Current ambient light level: $lightLevel');
  });
}
```

3. Call this method in your widget's lifecycle, such as in `initState()`.

This setup will allow you to receive real-time updates on the ambient light levels.

# Complete Example of Using the Ambient Light Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ambient_light/ambient_light.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _lightLevel = 0.0; // Variable to hold the current light level

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start listening to the ambient light sensor
    listenToAmbientLight();
  }

  void listenToAmbientLight() {
    // Listen to the ambient light sensor stream
    AmbientLight().lightSensorStream.listen((lightLevel) {
      // Update the state with the new light level
      setState(() {
        _lightLevel = lightLevel; // Update the light level
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Ambient Light Sensor Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Current Ambient Light Level: $_lightLevel lux',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the ambient light level.
// 3. In the initState method, we call listenToAmbientLight to start listening for changes in the ambient light sensor.
// 4. The listenToAmbientLight method subscribes to the lightSensorStream provided by the AmbientLight package.
// 5. Whenever the light level changes, the listener updates the _lightLevel variable and calls setState to refresh the UI.
// 6. The build method displays the current ambient light level in the center of the screen.

### Summary
In this blog post, we explored the `ambient_light` Flutter package, which allows developers to access ambient light sensor data. We covered the installation process, platform-specific configurations, and provided a complete example demonstrating how to implement the package in a Flutter application. The example showcased how to listen for changes in ambient light levels and update the UI accordingly. This package is particularly useful for applications that require adaptive UI features based on environmental light conditions.
