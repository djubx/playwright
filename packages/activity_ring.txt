# Activity Ring Flutter Package

The **activity_ring** Flutter package is a powerful tool for developers looking to create visually appealing and interactive activity rings in their applications. This package is particularly useful for fitness and health-related apps, where visualizing progress towards goals can enhance user engagement and motivation.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the **activity_ring** package in scenarios such as:
- Fitness tracking applications that display user activity levels.
- Health apps that visualize daily step counts or calorie burn.
- Any application that requires a circular progress indicator to represent completion or achievement of a goal.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily customize the colors, stroke width, and other visual aspects of the activity ring.
- **Animation Support**: The package supports smooth animations, making the transitions visually appealing.
- **Multiple Rings**: You can display multiple rings to represent different metrics (e.g., steps, calories, active minutes).

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Activity Ring Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **activity_ring** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  activity_ring: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access health data. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSHealthShareUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to health data.</string>
<key>NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires permission to update health data.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Activity Ring

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the activity ring in your app.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:activity_ring/activity_ring.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Activity Ring Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Activity Ring Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ActivityRing(
            // Setting the progress to 75%
            progress: 0.75,
            // Customizing the appearance
            ringColor: Colors.blue,
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
            strokeWidth: 20,
            // Adding a label in the center
            child: Text(
              '75%',
              style: TextStyle(
                fontSize: 24,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Activity Ring Demo'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the ActivityRing widget.
// 5. The ActivityRing widget is configured with a progress of 75%, a blue ring color, a grey background, and a stroke width of 20.
// 6. A Text widget is placed in the center of the ring to display the percentage of progress.
// 7. The app will display a circular progress indicator representing 75% completion visually.
```
