# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using ribbon_widget

## Installation
To use the `ribbon_widget` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ribbon_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you plan to use any features that require user permissions. However, the `ribbon_widget` package does not require any special permissions.

## Basic Usage
To use the `ribbon_widget`, you can wrap any widget with the `Ribbon` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ribbon_widget/ribbon_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Ribbon Widget Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Ribbon(
          color: Colors.red,
          title: 'New',
          child: Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 200,
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple `Container` with a ribbon that says "New" on it.

# Complete Example of ribbon_widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ribbon_widget/ribbon_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Ribbon Widget Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Wrapping the Container with Ribbon widget
          child: Ribbon(
            // Setting the color of the ribbon
            color: Colors.red,
            // Title displayed on the ribbon
            title: 'New',
            // The child widget to which the ribbon is attached
            child: Container(
              width: 200, // Width of the container
              height: 200, // Height of the container
              color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the container
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. Inside the `build` method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Ribbon Widget Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered, and a Ribbon widget is created.
// 5. The Ribbon widget has a red color and displays the title 'New'.
// 6. The child of the Ribbon is a Container with a width and height of 200 pixels and a blue background.
// 7. When the app runs, it displays a blue square with a red ribbon on top, indicating a new item.
