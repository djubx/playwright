# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the TradingView TA Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `tradingview_ta` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `tradingview_ta` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tradingview_ta: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to fetch and display technical analysis data.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:tradingview_ta/tradingview_ta.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class (which we will define in the next section) and use it to fetch technical analysis data.

3. Display the data in your UI.

This will be demonstrated in the complete example section below.

# Complete Example of Using the TradingView TA Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tradingview_ta/tradingview_ta.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'TradingView TA Example',
      home: TradingViewHome(),
    );
  }
}

class TradingViewHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TradingViewHomeState createState() => _TradingViewHomeState();
}

class _TradingViewHomeState extends State<TradingViewHome> {
  // Declare a variable to hold the technical analysis data
  TechnicalAnalysis? analysis;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch technical analysis data for a specific symbol
    fetchTechnicalAnalysis();
  }

  // Function to fetch technical analysis data
  Future<void> fetchTechnicalAnalysis() async {
    // Create an instance of the TradingViewTA class
    final tradingViewTA = TradingViewTA();

    // Fetch analysis for the symbol 'AAPL'
    analysis = await tradingViewTA.getAnalysis('AAPL');

    // Update the UI after fetching data
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('TradingView TA Example'),
      ),
      body: analysis == null
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator while fetching data
          : Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
              child: Column(
                crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
                children: [
                  Text(
                    'Technical Analysis for ${analysis!.symbol}',
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                  ),
                  SizedBox(height: 20),
                  Text('Recommendation: ${analysis!.recommendation}'),
                  SizedBox(height: 10),
                  Text('Support: ${analysis!.support}'),
                  SizedBox(height: 10),
                  Text('Resistance: ${analysis!.resistance}'),
                  SizedBox(height: 10),
                  Text('Indicators:'),
                  ...analysis!.indicators.map((indicator) {
                    return Text('- $indicator');
                  }).toList(),
                ],
              ),
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and its home.
// 3. TradingViewHome is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the technical analysis data.
// 4. In the initState method, fetchTechnicalAnalysis is called to retrieve data when the widget is first created.
// 5. fetchTechnicalAnalysis creates an instance of TradingViewTA and fetches analysis for the 'AAPL' symbol.
// 6. Once the data is fetched, setState is called to update the UI.
// 7. The build method displays a loading indicator while data is being fetched, and once available, it shows the technical analysis results.
