# flutter_soloud Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `flutter_soloud`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_soloud: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       compileOptions {
           sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
           targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key to allow audio playback:

   ```xml
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your microphone for audio playback.</string>
   ```

2. **Enable Background Modes**: In Xcode, go to your project settings, select the "Capabilities" tab, and enable "Background Modes". Check the "Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture" option.

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_soloud/flutter_soloud.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `flutter_soloud` package to play a sound:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: AudioPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class AudioPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AudioPlayerScreenState createState() => _AudioPlayerScreenState();
}

class _AudioPlayerScreenState extends State<AudioPlayerScreen> {
  late SoLoud soloud;
  late int soundHandle;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    soloud = SoLoud();
    soloud.init();
    soundHandle = soloud.load("assets/sound.mp3"); // Load your audio file
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    soloud.deinit();
    super.dispose();
  }

  void playSound() {
    soloud.play(soundHandle);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Audio Player")),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: playSound,
          child: Text("Play Sound"),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the SoLoud engine, load an audio file, and play it when the button is pressed.

# Complete Example of flutter_soloud

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_soloud/flutter_soloud.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: AudioPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class AudioPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AudioPlayerScreenState createState() => _AudioPlayerScreenState();
}

class _AudioPlayerScreenState extends State<AudioPlayerScreen> {
  late SoLoud soloud; // Declare the SoLoud instance
  late int soundHandle; // Handle for the loaded sound

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    soloud = SoLoud(); // Initialize SoLoud
    soloud.init(); // Initialize the audio engine
    soundHandle = soloud.load("assets/sound.mp3"); // Load the audio file
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    soloud.deinit(); // Deinitialize the audio engine
    super.dispose();
  }

  void playSound() {
    soloud.play(soundHandle); // Play the loaded sound
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Audio Player")), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: playSound, // Play sound on button press
          child: Text("Play Sound"), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp and sets AudioPlayerScreen as the home.
// 3. AudioPlayerScreen initializes the SoLoud audio engine in initState.
// 4. It loads an audio file from the assets and stores the handle.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the playSound method is called.
// 6. playSound uses the SoLoud instance to play the loaded sound.
// 7. On dispose, the audio engine is deinitialized to free resources.
```
