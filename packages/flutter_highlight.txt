# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_highlight`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `flutter_highlight`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_highlight: ^0.7.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use `flutter_highlight` to display a code snippet.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_highlight/flutter_highlight.dart';
import 'package:flutter_highlight/themes/monokai-sublime.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Highlight Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: HighlightView(
            '''
            void main() {
              runApp(MyApp());
            }
            ''',
            language: 'dart', // Specify the language
            theme: monokaiSublimeTheme, // Use a predefined theme
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(12), // Add padding around the code
            textStyle: TextStyle(
              fontFamily: 'Courier',
              fontSize: 16,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Import Statements**: Import the necessary packages, including `flutter_highlight` and a theme.
- **RealFlutter Class**: This is the main class of the application, extending `StatelessWidget`.
- **MaterialApp**: The root widget of the application, providing material design.
- **HighlightView**: This widget is used to display the highlighted code. You specify the code, language, theme, padding, and text style.

With these steps, you can easily integrate `flutter_highlight` into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of `flutter_highlight`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_highlight/flutter_highlight.dart';
import 'package:flutter_highlight/themes/monokai-sublime.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Highlight Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: HighlightView(
            '''
            void main() {
              runApp(MyApp());
            }
            ''',
            language: 'dart', // Specify the language for syntax highlighting
            theme: monokaiSublimeTheme, // Use a predefined theme for styling
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(12), // Add padding around the code block
            textStyle: TextStyle(
              fontFamily: 'Courier', // Set the font family for the code
              fontSize: 16, // Set the font size for the code
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Flutter Highlight Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a `HighlightView` widget.
// 5. The `HighlightView` displays a Dart code snippet with syntax highlighting.
// 6. The language is set to 'dart', and the Monokai Sublime theme is applied for styling.
// 7. Padding is added around the code block, and the text style is customized with a Courier font and a font size of 16.
// 8. The result is a visually appealing display of the code snippet, making it easy to read and understand.
