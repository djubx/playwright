Here's a detailed technical blog on the "num_remap" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# num_remap Flutter Package

The `num_remap` package is a powerful utility for Flutter developers that allows for the remapping of numerical values from one range to another. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need to normalize data, adjust scales, or convert values for different contexts, such as mapping sensor readings to UI elements.

## When to Use `num_remap`

You might consider using the `num_remap` package in the following scenarios:

- **Data Normalization**: When you need to convert a set of values to a common scale, such as normalizing scores from different tests.
- **UI Scaling**: When adjusting values for UI components, like mapping a temperature reading to a color gradient.
- **Game Development**: For remapping player scores or game metrics to fit within a specific range for display purposes.

## Features

- **Simple API**: The package provides an easy-to-use API for remapping numbers.
- **Flexible Ranges**: You can define any input and output range, making it versatile for various applications.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance, ensuring that remapping operations are efficient.

## Example Usage

Here’s a simple example of how to use the `num_remap` package:

```dart
import 'package:num_remap/num_remap.dart';

void main() {
  // Remap a value from the range [0, 100] to [0, 1]
  double remappedValue = numRemap(50, 0, 100, 0, 1);
  print(remappedValue); // Output: 0.5
}
```

In this example, the value `50` is remapped from the range `[0, 100]` to the range `[0, 1]`, resulting in `0.5`. This demonstrates the core functionality of the `num_remap` package.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using num_remap

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `num_remap` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  num_remap: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `num_remap` package:

```dart
import 'package:num_remap/num_remap.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using num_remap

You can now use the `num_remap` function to remap numbers. Here’s how to do it:

### Basic Usage

```dart
double remappedValue = numRemap(30, 0, 100, 0, 1);
print(remappedValue); // Output: 0.3
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least `21` to avoid compatibility issues.
  
  ```gradle
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

## Step 4: Optimizations

For optimal performance, especially in applications with frequent remapping, consider caching results if the same values are remapped multiple times. This can reduce computation time and improve responsiveness.

### Example of Caching

```dart
Map<String, double> cache = {};

double cachedRemap(double value, double inputMin, double inputMax, double outputMin, double outputMax) {
  String key = '$value-$inputMin-$inputMax-$outputMin-$outputMax';
  if (cache.containsKey(key)) {
    return cache[key]!;
  } else {
    double result = numRemap(value, inputMin, inputMax, outputMin, outputMax);
    cache[key] = result;
    return result;
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of num_remap in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:num_remap/num_remap.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Num Remap Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Num Remap Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RemapExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RemapExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Original value to be remapped
    double originalValue = 75;

    // Remap the value from range [0, 100] to [0, 1]
    double remappedValue = numRemap(originalValue, 0, 100, 0, 1);

    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Original Value: $originalValue'),
        Text('Remapped Value: $remappedValue'),
        // Display a visual representation of the remapped value
        Container(
          width: 200,
          height: 20,
          color: Colors.grey,
          child: FractionallySizedBox(
            widthFactor: remappedValue, // Use the remapped value to set the width
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, the RemapExample widget is displayed.
// 4. The RemapExample widget defines an original value (75) and remaps it to a new range (0 to 1).
// 5. The original and remapped values are displayed as text.
// 6. A visual representation of the remapped value is created using a Container and FractionallySizedBox, where the width of the blue box is determined by the remapped value.
```
