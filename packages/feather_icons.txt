# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Feather Icons

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the feather_icons package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  feather_icons: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the feather_icons package:

```dart
import 'package:feather_icons/feather_icons.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Icons in Your Application

You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use a Feather icon in a `Container` widget:

```dart
Container(
  child: Icon(
    FeatherIcons.home, // Using the home icon from feather_icons
    size: 30.0, // Setting the size of the icon
    color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
  ),
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'

# Complete Example of Using Feather Icons

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:feather_icons/feather_icons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Feather Icons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Feather Icons in Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a home icon
              Icon(
                FeatherIcons.home,
                size: 50.0,
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a user icon
              Icon(
                FeatherIcons.user,
                size: 50.0,
                color: Colors.green,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a settings icon
              Icon(
                FeatherIcons.settings,
                size: 50.0,
                color: Colors.red,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 5. Each Icon widget uses a different Feather icon (home, user, settings) with specified sizes and colors.
// 6. SizedBox widgets are used to add spacing between the icons for better visual separation.
```
