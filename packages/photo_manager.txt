# Overview of the photo_manager Flutter Package

The `photo_manager` package is a powerful tool for managing and accessing photos and videos on both Android and iOS devices in Flutter applications. It provides a unified API to interact with the device's media library, allowing developers to retrieve, manipulate, and display media files seamlessly.

## When to Use

You should consider using the `photo_manager` package in scenarios such as:
- Building a gallery application that requires access to the user's photo and video library.
- Creating an app that allows users to upload or share media files.
- Developing applications that need to display media content from the device in a structured manner.

## Key Features

- **Access to Media Files**: Retrieve images and videos from the device's gallery.
- **Media Metadata**: Access metadata such as creation date, location, and more.
- **Permission Handling**: Automatically handles permissions for accessing media files.
- **Image and Video Selection**: Provides functionality to select multiple images and videos.
- **Support for Different Media Types**: Works with various media formats, including images, videos, and GIFs.

The `photo_manager` package is essential for any Flutter application that requires media management capabilities, providing a robust and efficient way to interact with the device's media library.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the photo_manager Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `photo_manager` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  photo_manager: ^2.5.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configuring Permissions

### Android

For Android, you need to add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires permission to save photos to your library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to access and display images from the device's gallery.

# Complete Example of Using the photo_manager Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:photo_manager/photo_manager.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<AssetEntity> _mediaList = []; // List to hold media assets

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchMedia(); // Fetch media on initialization
  }

  // Function to fetch media from the gallery
  Future<void> _fetchMedia() async {
    // Request permission to access the media library
    final PermissionState permission = await PhotoManager.requestPermissionExtend();
    
    if (permission.isAuth) {
      // If permission is granted, fetch the media
      List<AssetEntity> media = await PhotoManager.getAssetList(
        type: AssetType.image, // Specify the type of media to fetch
      );
      setState(() {
        _mediaList = media; // Update the state with the fetched media
      });
    } else {
      // Handle the case when permission is denied
      print("Permission denied");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Photo Manager Example'), // App title
        ),
        body: _mediaList.isEmpty
            ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator if no media
            : GridView.builder(
                gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
                  crossAxisCount: 3, // Number of columns in the grid
                ),
                itemCount: _mediaList.length, // Total number of media items
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  return AssetEntityImage(
                    _mediaList[index], // Display each media item
                    fit: BoxFit.cover, // Fit the image in the grid cell
                  );
                },
              ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize a stateful widget to manage the media list.
// 3. On initialization, the _fetchMedia function is called to request permission and fetch media.
// 4. If permission is granted, we retrieve the list of images from the gallery and update the state.
// 5. The build method displays a loading indicator while fetching media.
// 6. Once media is fetched, it displays the images in a grid format using GridView.builder.
// 7. Each image is displayed using AssetEntityImage, which is part of the photo_manager package.
