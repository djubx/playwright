# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_svprogresshud

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_svprogresshud` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_svprogresshud: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_svprogresshud/flutter_svprogresshud.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to ensure proper functioning:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to show a loading HUD:

```dart
// Show the loading HUD
SVProgressHUD.show();

// Simulate a network request
await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));

// Dismiss the HUD
SVProgressHUD.dismiss();
```

### Customization

You can customize the HUD as follows:

```dart
SVProgressHUD.setDefaultStyle(SVProgressHUDStyle.dark);
SVProgressHUD.setForegroundColor(Colors.white);
SVProgressHUD.setBackgroundColor(Colors.black);
```

## Step 5: Handling Success and Error States

To show success or error messages, you can use:

```dart
// Show success message
SVProgressHUD.showSuccessWithStatus("Operation Successful!");

// Show error message
SVProgressHUD.showErrorWithStatus("An error occurred!");
```

This setup allows you to provide a seamless user experience by indicating the status of operations clearly.

# Complete Example of flutter_svprogresshud

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_svprogresshud/flutter_svprogresshud.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SVProgressHUD Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SVProgressHUD Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Show the loading HUD
            SVProgressHUD.show();

            // Simulate a network request
            await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));

            // Dismiss the HUD
            SVProgressHUD.dismiss();

            // Show success message
            SVProgressHUD.showSuccessWithStatus("Operation Successful!");
          },
          child: Text('Start Operation'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a button that, when pressed, shows a loading HUD.
// 4. The app simulates a network request with a 2-second delay.
// 5. After the delay, the HUD is dismissed, and a success message is displayed.
// 6. This flow provides clear feedback to the user about the operation's status.
```
