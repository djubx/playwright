# Tutorial: Setting Up `tbib_secure_screen` in Your Flutter Project

In this section, we'll walk through the process of integrating the `tbib_secure_screen` package into a Flutter project, including platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `tbib_secure_screen` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tbib_secure_screen: ^latest_version
```

Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Android Configuration

For Android, no additional configuration is required. The package automatically handles the necessary settings to prevent screen capture.

## Step 4: iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your app's `Info.plist` file includes the following key to prevent screen recording:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

This setting helps manage background tasks, which can be relevant for security features.

## Step 5: Using the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:tbib_secure_screen/tbib_secure_screen.dart';
```

Initialize the `RealFlutter` class and use its methods to enable or disable secure screen features as needed.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tbib_secure_screen/tbib_secure_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Secure Screen Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: SecureScreenExample(),
    );
  }
}

class SecureScreenExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SecureScreenExampleState createState() => _SecureScreenExampleState();
}

class _SecureScreenExampleState extends State<SecureScreenExample> {
  // Initialize the RealFlutter class
  final RealFlutter _secureScreen = RealFlutter();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Enable secure screen to prevent screenshots and recordings
    _secureScreen.enableSecureScreen();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Disable secure screen when the widget is disposed
    _secureScreen.disableSecureScreen();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Secure Screen Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Screen capture is disabled!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts by running the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a home screen set to SecureScreenExample.
// 3. SecureScreenExample is a stateful widget that manages the secure screen feature.
// 4. In the initState method, the secure screen is enabled using RealFlutter's enableSecureScreen method.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with a centered text indicating that screen capture is disabled.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, the secure screen is disabled to clean up resources.
