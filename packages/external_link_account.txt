# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `external_link_account` Package

## Installation
To get started with the `external_link_account` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  external_link_account: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/external_link_account).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries to allow external links:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:external_link_account/external_link_account.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and use its methods to open links or manage accounts.

### Example Usage
```dart
RealFlutter().openLink('https://example.com');
```

This will open the specified URL in the user's default web browser.

With these steps, you are now ready to integrate the `external_link_account` package into your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the `external_link_account` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:external_link_account/external_link_account.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'External Link Account Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('External Link Account Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Create an instance of RealFlutter
            RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();
            // Open an external link
            realFlutter.openLink('https://example.com');
          },
          child: Text('Open External Link'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code defines a simple Flutter application with a button.
// When the button is pressed, it creates an instance of the RealFlutter class.
// It then calls the openLink method with a specified URL, which opens the link
// in the user's default web browser. The app consists of a MaterialApp with a 
// HomePage that contains a button in the center of the screen.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->
```

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application starts with the `main()` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
- `MyApp` sets up a `MaterialApp` with a title and a home page.
- The `HomePage` widget contains an `ElevatedButton`.
- When the button is pressed, an instance of `RealFlutter` is created, and the `openLink` method is called with a URL.
- This action opens the specified URL in the user's default web browser, demonstrating the core functionality of the `external_link_account` package.
