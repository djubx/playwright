              size: 100,

              overlay: Icon(Icons.check_circle),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Create a rectangular avatar view with a custom border color
            AvatarView(
              shape: AvatarShape.rectangle,
              size: 100,
              avatar: Image.asset('assets/profile_picture.jpg'),
              borderColor: Colors.red,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a material app.
// 2. The app displays a scaffold with an app bar and a body.
// 3. The body contains a column with three avatar views.
// 4. Each avatar view displays a different shape (circular, square, rectangular) and overlay (text, icon, none).
// 5. The user can view the different avatar views and their customizations.

// In summary, this code demonstrates the usage of the avatar_view package to create custom avatar views in a Flutter app.
// The app displays three different avatar views with various shapes and overlays, showcasing the package's features.
