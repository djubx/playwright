# Tutorial: Using the Multiline Flutter Package
=============================================

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To use the `multiline` package, you need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multiline: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `multiline` package:

```dart
import 'package:multiline/multiline.dart';
```

## Step 3: Create a Multiline Text Field

To create a multiline text field, use the `MultilineTextField` widget:

```dart
MultilineTextField(
  controller: _controller,
  minLines: 1,
  maxLines: 5,
)
```

You can customize the text field by passing in various properties, such as `minLines`, `maxLines`, `style`, and more.

## Platform-Specific Details

The `multiline` package works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to adjust the text field's properties to achieve the desired look and feel on each platform.

For example, on Android, you may want to set the `minLines` property to 1 to ensure that the text field starts with a single line. On iOS, you may want to set the `maxLines` property to null to allow the text field to expand indefinitely.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multiline/multiline.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Multiline Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  final _controller = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Multiline Demo'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Create a multiline text field with a minimum of 1 line and a maximum of 5 lines
            MultilineTextField(
              controller: _controller,
              minLines: 1,
              maxLines: 5,
              // Customize the text style
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 16),
            // Create a button to clear the text field
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                _controller.clear();
              },
              child: Text('Clear'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a multiline text field.
// 2. The user can type in the text field, and the text will wrap to the next line when the maximum width is reached.
// 3. The user can press the "Clear" button to clear the text field.
// 4. The text field will start with a minimum of 1 line and can expand up to a maximum of 5 lines.
// 5. The text style is customized to have a font size of 18.

// In summary, this code creates a simple multiline text field with a clear button, demonstrating the basic functionality of the `multiline` package.
