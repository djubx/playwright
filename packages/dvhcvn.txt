# Using the dvhcvn Flutter Package
================================

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To use the `dvhcvn` package, you need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line:

```yml
dependencies:
  dvhcvn: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Import the Package

To use the package, you need to import it into your Dart file. Add the following line at the top of your file:

```dart
import 'package:dvhcvn/dvhcvn.dart';
```

## Step 3: Use the Package

The `dvhcvn` package provides several functions for converting between different address formats. Here are a few examples:

*   `getProvinceName(String provinceId)`: returns the full name of the province with the given ID
*   `getDistrictName(String provinceId, String districtId)`: returns the full name of the district with the given ID in the given province
*   `getWardName(String provinceId, String districtId, String wardId)`: returns the full name of the ward with the given ID in the given district and province

You can use these functions to convert addresses as needed.

### Platform-Specific Details

The `dvhcvn` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you need to configure the package differently for each platform.

#### Android

To use the `dvhcvn` package on Android, you need to add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

This permission is required for the package to work properly.

#### iOS

To use the `dvhcvn` package on iOS, you need to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

This configuration is required for the package to work properly.

        ),

    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a screen containing three buttons.
// 2. The user clicks the "Get Province Name" button, which calls the _getProvinceName function.
// 3. The _getProvinceName function uses the getProvinceName function from the dvhcvn package to get the province name.
// 4. The province name is then displayed on the screen.
// 5. The user can repeat steps 2-4 for the district and ward names.
// 6. The app uses the dvhcvn package to convert the province, district, and ward IDs to their corresponding names.
