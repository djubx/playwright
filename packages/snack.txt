Here's a detailed technical blog on the "snack" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Snack Flutter Package

The Snack package for Flutter is a lightweight and flexible solution for displaying snackbars in your Flutter applications. Snackbars are brief messages that provide feedback about an operation in a way that doesn’t interrupt the user’s flow. They can be used to inform users about the success or failure of an action, or to provide additional context.

## When to Use Snack

You should consider using the Snack package when:
- You need to display transient messages to users without interrupting their workflow.
- You want to provide feedback on user actions, such as form submissions or data updates.
- You require a customizable and easy-to-use solution for displaying snackbars.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily customize the look and feel of the snackbars to match your app's theme.
- **Flexible Duration**: Control how long the snackbar is displayed on the screen.
- **Action Buttons**: Add action buttons to your snackbars for user interaction.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with your existing Flutter application.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Snack Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Snack package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  snack: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Snack Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to display a snackbar using the Snack package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:snack/snack.dart'; // Import the snack package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Snack Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Display a snackbar when the button is pressed
            Snack.show(
              context,
              message: 'This is a snackbar message!',
              duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
              action: SnackAction(
                label: 'Undo',
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle the action when the button is pressed
                  print('Undo action pressed');
                },
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Snackbar'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a snackbar will appear at the bottom of the screen with a message and an action button.

# Complete Example of the Snack Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:snack/snack.dart'; // Import the snack package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Snack Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Display a snackbar when the button is pressed
            Snack.show(
              context,
              message: 'This is a snackbar message!',
              duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration for which the snackbar is displayed
              action: SnackAction(
                label: 'Undo', // Label for the action button
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle the action when the button is pressed
                  print('Undo action pressed'); // Log the action
                },
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Snackbar'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a HomeScreen as its home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The Center widget holds an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the Snack.show method is called to display a snackbar.
// 6. The snackbar shows a message for 2 seconds and includes an action button labeled 'Undo'.
// 7. If the 'Undo' button is pressed, a message is printed to the console.
```
