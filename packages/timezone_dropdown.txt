# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Timezone Dropdown Package

## Installation
To use the `timezone_dropdown` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  timezone_dropdown: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires location services to determine the user's time zone automatically. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to set the correct time zone.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `timezone_dropdown` package, you can create a simple widget that utilizes the dropdown. Below is a basic example of how to implement it in your Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timezone_dropdown/timezone_dropdown.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Timezone Dropdown Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Select Your Timezone'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TimezoneDropdown(
            onChanged: (String? newValue) {
              // Handle the selected time zone
              print('Selected Timezone: $newValue');
            },
            // Optional: Set a default value
            initialValue: 'UTC',
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a dropdown for selecting time zones. The `onChanged` callback allows you to handle the selected time zone.

# Complete Example of Timezone Dropdown

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timezone_dropdown/timezone_dropdown.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Timezone Dropdown Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Select Your Timezone'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TimezoneDropdown(
            onChanged: (String? newValue) {
              // This function is called when a new time zone is selected
              print('Selected Timezone: $newValue'); // Print the selected time zone
            },
            initialValue: 'UTC', // Set the default time zone to UTC
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Select Your Timezone".
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the TimezoneDropdown widget.
// 5. The TimezoneDropdown widget displays a dropdown list of time zones.
// 6. When a user selects a time zone, the onChanged callback is triggered, printing the selected time zone to the console.
// 7. The initial value of the dropdown is set to 'UTC', which is displayed when the app first loads.
