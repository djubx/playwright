// The application flow starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` app.
// The `RealFlutter` app uses the `MaterialApp` widget to create a material design app.
// The `MaterialApp` widget has a `title` property that sets the title of the app.
// The `home` property sets the home page of the app, which is a `Scaffold` widget.
// The `Scaffold` widget has an `appBar` property that sets the app bar of the page.
// The `appBar` property is an `AppBar` widget that has a `title` property that sets the title of the app bar.
// The `body` property sets the body of the page, which is a `Center` widget.
// The `Center` widget has a `child` property that sets the child of the widget, which is a `CachedVideoPlayer` widget.
// The `CachedVideoPlayer` widget plays a video from the internet and caches it for offline use.

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// 1. The `main` function runs the `RealFlutter` app.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` app creates a material design app with a title and a home page.
// 3. The home page is a `Scaffold` widget with an app bar and a body.
// 4. The app bar has a title, and the body has a `Center` widget with a `CachedVideoPlayer` widget as its child.
// 5. The `CachedVideoPlayer` widget plays a video from the internet and caches it for offline use.
