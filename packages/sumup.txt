# Tutorial: Setting Up the "sumup" Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the "sumup" package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the "sumup" package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sumup: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
   ```

2. **Add the SumUp SDK**: Ensure that your `build.gradle` file includes the necessary dependencies for the SumUp SDK.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **CocoaPods**: Make sure to run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to install any necessary dependencies.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate a payment:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sumup/sumup.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('SumUp Payment Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Initiate payment process
              SumUp.startPayment(
                amount: 10.00,
                currency: 'EUR',
                onSuccess: (transactionId) {
                  // Handle successful payment
                  print('Payment successful: $transactionId');
                },
                onError: (error) {
                  // Handle payment error
                  print('Payment error: $error');
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that initiates a payment when pressed. The `SumUp.startPayment` method is called with the payment amount and currency, along with success and error callbacks.

# Complete Example of Using the "sumup" Package

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the "sumup" package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sumup/sumup.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SumUp Payment Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('SumUp Payment Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Initiate payment process
              SumUp.startPayment(
                amount: 10.00, // Amount to be charged
                currency: 'EUR', // Currency type
                onSuccess: (transactionId) {
                  // Handle successful payment
                  print('Payment successful: $transactionId');
                  // You can navigate to a success page or show a success message
                },
                onError: (error) {
                  // Handle payment error
                  print('Payment error: $error');
                  // You can show an error message to the user
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title "SumUp Payment Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the SumUp.startPayment method is called.
// 6. The payment amount and currency are specified, along with success and error callbacks.
// 7. If the payment is successful, the transaction ID is printed, and you can handle further actions.
// 8. If there is an error, the error message is printed, allowing you to inform the user.
```

In this complete example, we have a simple Flutter application that integrates the "sumup" package for payment processing. The application flow is straightforward, allowing users to initiate a payment with a button click. The success and error handling mechanisms are in place to provide feedback to the user.

## Final Summary

The "sumup" package provides a robust solution for integrating payment processing into Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions outlined in this blog, developers can easily implement payment functionality, enhancing their applications and providing a seamless user experience. The example provided demonstrates the essential features of the package, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit.
