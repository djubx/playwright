# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Sticker View Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **sticker_view** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sticker_view: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires access to the camera or photo library. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to add stickers.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
```

## Step 4: Using the Sticker View

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the sticker view in your app.

# Complete Example of Using the Sticker View Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sticker_view/sticker_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sticker View Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Sticker View Example'),
        ),
        body: StickerViewExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class StickerViewExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StickerViewExampleState createState() => _StickerViewExampleState();
}

class _StickerViewExampleState extends State<StickerViewExample> {
  // List to hold stickers
  List<Sticker> stickers = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Stack(
      children: [
        // Background container
        Container(
          color: Colors.grey[200],
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'Tap to add a sticker',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ),
        ),
        // Sticker view
        StickerView(
          stickers: stickers,
          onStickerAdded: (sticker) {
            // Add sticker to the list when added
            setState(() {
              stickers.add(sticker);
            });
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 3. The StickerViewExample widget is created, which manages the state of the stickers.
// 4. A Stack widget is used to layer the background and the sticker view.
// 5. The StickerView widget is initialized with an empty list of stickers.
// 6. When a sticker is added, the onStickerAdded callback updates the state to include the new sticker.
// 7. The app displays a simple interface where users can tap to add stickers to the canvas.
