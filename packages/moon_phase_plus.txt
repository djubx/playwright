<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Moon Phase Plus Flutter Package

The **moon_phase_plus** Flutter package is a powerful tool for developers looking to integrate lunar phase calculations into their applications. This package provides an easy-to-use API for determining the current moon phase, as well as the moon's age, illumination, and other related data. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the **moon_phase_plus** package in applications that require:
- Astronomy-related features, such as star-gazing apps.
- Gardening applications that depend on lunar cycles.
- Health and wellness apps that track lunar phases for holistic practices.
- Educational apps that teach users about astronomy and the moon's influence.

## Features
- **Moon Phase Calculation**: Easily determine the current phase of the moon (e.g., New Moon, Full Moon).
- **Moon Age**: Get the age of the moon in days.
- **Illumination Percentage**: Calculate the percentage of the moon's surface that is illuminated.
- **Date Flexibility**: Perform calculations for any given date, not just the current date.

With these features, developers can create rich, interactive experiences that leverage the moon's cycles.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Moon Phase Plus

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the **moon_phase_plus** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  moon_phase_plus: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:moon_phase_plus/moon_phase_plus.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package
You can now use the package to get moon phase information. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve the current moon phase:

```dart
void getCurrentMoonPhase() async {
  final now = DateTime.now();
  final moonPhase = await MoonPhase.getMoonPhase(now);
  print('Current Moon Phase: ${moonPhase.phase}');
}
```

This function retrieves the current moon phase and prints it to the console.

# Complete Example of Moon Phase Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:moon_phase_plus/moon_phase_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Moon Phase Plus Example',
      home: MoonPhaseHome(),
    );
  }
}

class MoonPhaseHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MoonPhaseHomeState createState() => _MoonPhaseHomeState();
}

class _MoonPhaseHomeState extends State<MoonPhaseHome> {
  String _moonPhase = 'Unknown'; // Variable to hold the moon phase

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getCurrentMoonPhase(); // Fetch the current moon phase on initialization
  }

  // Function to get the current moon phase
  void _getCurrentMoonPhase() async {
    final now = DateTime.now(); // Get the current date and time
    final moonPhase = await MoonPhase.getMoonPhase(now); // Fetch the moon phase
    setState(() {
      _moonPhase = moonPhase.phase; // Update the state with the moon phase
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Current Moon Phase'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Current Moon Phase: $_moonPhase', // Display the moon phase
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. MoonPhaseHome is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the current moon phase.
// 4. In the initState method, _getCurrentMoonPhase is called to fetch the current moon phase.
// 5. _getCurrentMoonPhase uses the MoonPhase.getMoonPhase method to get the moon phase for the current date.
// 6. The state is updated with the fetched moon phase, which triggers a rebuild of the widget.
// 7. The current moon phase is displayed in the center of the screen.
```
