# Overview of the popover_gtk Flutter Package

The `popover_gtk` package is a Flutter plugin designed to create popover menus in GTK applications. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to enhance their user interfaces with contextual menus that provide additional options without cluttering the main interface. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using `popover_gtk` in scenarios such as:
- Displaying additional options related to a specific UI element when a user interacts with it.
- Providing contextual help or information without navigating away from the current screen.
- Creating a more interactive and user-friendly experience in GTK-based Flutter applications.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Popovers**: Easily customize the appearance and behavior of popovers to fit your application's design.
- **Event Handling**: Manage user interactions with popovers, including opening, closing, and selecting options.
- **Integration with GTK**: Seamlessly integrates with GTK, making it a suitable choice for desktop applications built with Flutter.

Overall, `popover_gtk` is a powerful tool for enhancing user experience in Flutter applications targeting GTK platforms.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using popover_gtk

## Installation
To get started with the `popover_gtk` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  popover_gtk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/popover_gtk).

## Platform-Specific Details
### For Android
- Ensure that your Flutter project is set up for desktop support. You may need to configure your `AndroidManifest.xml` to support GTK if you are targeting Android devices.

### For iOS
- Similar to Android, ensure that your project is configured for desktop support. You may need to adjust your `Info.plist` file to accommodate any specific permissions or settings required by GTK.

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a popover:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:popover_gtk/popover_gtk.dart';
   ```

2. Create a popover and attach it to a widget:
   ```dart
   PopoverGtk popover = PopoverGtk(
     child: Text('This is a popover!'),
   );

   // Attach the popover to a button
   ElevatedButton(
     onPressed: () {
       popover.show(context);
     },
     child: Text('Show Popover'),
   );
   ```

This basic setup will allow you to display a popover when the button is pressed. You can further customize the popover's content and behavior as needed.

# Complete Example of Using popover_gtk

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:popover_gtk/popover_gtk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Popover GTK Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Popover GTK Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create a popover instance
              PopoverGtk popover = PopoverGtk(
                child: Column(
                  mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
                  children: [
                    Text('Option 1'),
                    Text('Option 2'),
                    Text('Option 3'),
                  ],
                ),
              );

              // Show the popover when the button is pressed
              popover.show(context);
            },
            child: Text('Show Popover'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Popover GTK Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, initializes a PopoverGtk instance.
// 6. The popover contains a Column with three text options.
// 7. The popover is displayed when the button is pressed, providing the user with additional options without navigating away from the main screen.
