# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `fwfh_webview`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `fwfh_webview` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `fwfh_webview` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fwfh_webview: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/fwfh_webview).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries to allow arbitrary loads (if necessary):

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement the `fwfh_webview` package.

# Complete Example of `fwfh_webview`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fwfh_webview/fwfh_webview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'fwfh_webview Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: WebViewExample(),
    );
  }
}

class WebViewExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WebViewExampleState createState() => _WebViewExampleState();
}

class _WebViewExampleState extends State<WebViewExample> {
  // Controller to manage the WebView
  late WebViewController _controller;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('WebView Example'),
      ),
      body: WebView(
        initialUrl: 'https://flutter.dev', // The initial URL to load
        onWebViewCreated: (WebViewController controller) {
          _controller = controller; // Initialize the controller
        },
        onPageFinished: (String url) {
          print('Page finished loading: $url'); // Log when the page finishes loading
        },
        onWebResourceError: (WebResourceError error) {
          print('Error loading page: ${error.description}'); // Log any loading errors
        },
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          _controller.reload(); // Reload the current page
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.refresh),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to WebViewExample, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In WebViewExample, a WebView is created with an initial URL.
// 5. The onWebViewCreated callback initializes the WebViewController.
// 6. The onPageFinished callback logs when a page has finished loading.
// 7. The onWebResourceError callback logs any errors that occur during loading.
// 8. A FloatingActionButton is provided to reload the current page when pressed.
```
