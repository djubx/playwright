# Overview of the `switch_when` Flutter Package

The `switch_when` package is a powerful utility for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of managing state transitions in a clean and efficient manner. It allows developers to switch between different states based on conditions, making it particularly useful for applications that require dynamic UI updates based on user interactions or data changes.

## When to Use `switch_when`

You might consider using `switch_when` in scenarios such as:
- Managing complex UI states that depend on multiple conditions.
- Implementing feature toggles where different UI components are displayed based on certain flags.
- Handling asynchronous data fetching where the UI needs to reflect loading, success, and error states.

## Key Features
- **Declarative Syntax**: Provides a clean and readable way to define state transitions.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that all possible states are accounted for, reducing runtime errors.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be easily integrated into existing Flutter applications without significant refactoring.

Overall, `switch_when` enhances the way developers manage state in Flutter applications, leading to more maintainable and understandable code.

# Setting Up and Using the `switch_when` Package

## Installation

To get started with the `switch_when` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  switch_when: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `switch_when` package, you will typically define a state and then use the `switchWhen` method to handle different UI states. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:switch_when/switch_when.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define a simple state
    final state = 'loading'; // This could be 'loading', 'success', or 'error'

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Switch When Example')),
        body: switchWhen(
          state,
          {
            'loading': () => Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()),
            'success': () => Center(child: Text('Data Loaded Successfully!')),
            'error': () => Center(child: Text('Error Loading Data')),
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the UI will display a loading indicator, a success message, or an error message based on the value of the `state` variable.

# Complete Example of Using `switch_when`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:switch_when/switch_when.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Define the current state of the application
  String _currentState = 'loading'; // Initial state is loading

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Simulate a network call
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
      // After 2 seconds, change the state to success
      setState(() {
        _currentState = 'success'; // Change state to success
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Switch When Example')),
        body: switchWhen(
          _currentState, // Pass the current state
          {
            'loading': () => Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()), // Loading state
            'success': () => Center(child: Text('Data Loaded Successfully!')), // Success state
            'error': () => Center(child: Text('Error Loading Data')), // Error state
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that manages its state.
// 3. In the initState method, a simulated network call is made using Future.delayed.
// 4. After 2 seconds, the state is updated to 'success', triggering a rebuild.
// 5. The build method uses switchWhen to display different UI based on the current state.
// 6. Initially, a loading indicator is shown, and after 2 seconds, the success message is displayed.
