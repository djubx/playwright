# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_install_app_plugin

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_install_app_plugin` and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `flutter_install_app_plugin` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_install_app_plugin: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INSTALL_PACKAGES"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow installation of apps:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Plugin
Now that we have set up the plugin, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initiate an app installation.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_install_app_plugin/flutter_install_app_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Install App Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Replace with your app's APK URL
              String apkUrl = 'https://example.com/path/to/your/app.apk';
              // Call the install method
              await FlutterInstallAppPlugin.installApp(apkUrl);
            },
            child: Text('Install App'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the app will attempt to install the APK from the specified URL.

# Complete Example of flutter_install_app_plugin

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_install_app_plugin/flutter_install_app_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Install App Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the URL of the APK to be installed
              String apkUrl = 'https://example.com/path/to/your/app.apk';
              // Call the install method from the plugin
              await FlutterInstallAppPlugin.installApp(apkUrl);
            },
            child: Text('Install App'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing a basic app structure.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the app's visual layout, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 6. The APK URL is defined, pointing to the location of the app to be installed.
// 7. The installApp method from the flutter_install_app_plugin is called with the APK URL.
// 8. The app attempts to install the APK, providing a seamless installation experience for the user.
