# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Internet Speed Meter Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **internet_speed_meter** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  internet_speed_meter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/internet_speed_meter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open the `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following lines to request permission for network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the internet speed meter in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:internet_speed_meter/internet_speed_meter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  InternetSpeedMeter _speedMeter;
  String _downloadSpeed = '0.0';
  String _uploadSpeed = '0.0';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _speedMeter = InternetSpeedMeter();
    _startSpeedMeter();
  }

  void _startSpeedMeter() {
    _speedMeter.startMonitoring((downloadSpeed, uploadSpeed) {
      setState(() {
        _downloadSpeed = downloadSpeed.toStringAsFixed(2);
        _uploadSpeed = uploadSpeed.toStringAsFixed(2);
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _speedMeter.stopMonitoring();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Internet Speed Meter')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Download Speed: $_downloadSpeed Mbps'),
            Text('Upload Speed: $_uploadSpeed Mbps'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays the current download and upload speeds. The `InternetSpeedMeter` class is used to start monitoring the speeds, and the results are displayed in the UI.

# Complete Example of Internet Speed Meter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:internet_speed_meter/internet_speed_meter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of InternetSpeedMeter
  InternetSpeedMeter _speedMeter;
  // Variables to hold download and upload speeds
  String _downloadSpeed = '0.0';
  String _uploadSpeed = '0.0';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the speed meter
    _speedMeter = InternetSpeedMeter();
    // Start monitoring internet speed
    _startSpeedMeter();
  }

  // Function to start monitoring internet speed
  void _startSpeedMeter() {
    _speedMeter.startMonitoring((downloadSpeed, uploadSpeed) {
      // Update the state with the new speeds
      setState(() {
        _downloadSpeed = downloadSpeed.toStringAsFixed(2); // Format download speed
        _uploadSpeed = uploadSpeed.toStringAsFixed(2);     // Format upload speed
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop monitoring when the widget is disposed
    _speedMeter.stopMonitoring();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Internet Speed Meter')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display download speed
            Text('Download Speed: $_downloadSpeed Mbps'),
            // Display upload speed
            Text('Upload Speed: $_uploadSpeed Mbps'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, an instance of InternetSpeedMeter is created.
// 3. The _startSpeedMeter method is called to begin monitoring internet speeds.
// 4. The speeds are updated in real-time using the setState method, which triggers a rebuild of the UI.
// 5. The download and upload speeds are displayed in the center of the screen.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, the monitoring is stopped to free up resources.
```

In summary, this blog provided a comprehensive overview of the **internet_speed_meter** Flutter package, including its features, setup instructions, and a complete example. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the speed meter, starts monitoring, and updates the UI with the current speeds, ensuring users are informed about their internet performance in real-time.
