# Tutorial: Setting Up CometChat Calls UI Kit

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `cometchat_calls_uikit` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `cometchat_calls_uikit` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cometchat_calls_uikit: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/cometchat_calls_uikit).

## Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

Additionally, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio calls.</string>
```

## Step 4: Initialize CometChat

Before using the package, you need to initialize CometChat in your application. This is typically done in the `main.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:cometchat_calls_uikit/cometchat_calls_uikit.dart';

void main() {
  CometChat.init("YOUR_APP_ID", "YOUR_REGION").then((value) {
    runApp(MyApp());
  }).catchError((error) {
    print("Error initializing CometChat: $error");
  });
}
```

Replace `YOUR_APP_ID` and `YOUR_REGION` with your CometChat application ID and region.

## Step 5: Using the Package

Once the setup is complete, you can start using the package to create voice and video calls. The package provides a simple API to initiate calls, manage call states, and handle incoming calls.

# Complete Example: Using CometChat Calls UI Kit

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the `cometchat_calls_uikit` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cometchat_calls_uikit/cometchat_calls_uikit.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize CometChat with your app ID and region
  CometChat.init("YOUR_APP_ID", "YOUR_REGION").then((value) {
    runApp(RealFlutter());
  }).catchError((error) {
    print("Error initializing CometChat: $error");
  });
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'CometChat Calls Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CallHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class CallHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('CometChat Calls'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Start a video call with a specific user
            CometChat.startCall(
              callType: CallType.video,
              receiverID: "RECEIVER_USER_ID", // Replace with the user ID you want to call
              receiverType: ReceiverType.user,
              // Optional parameters
              callOptions: CallOptions(
                // Customize call options if needed
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Start Video Call'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app initializes CometChat with the provided app ID and region.
// 2. The main widget, RealFlutter, sets up the MaterialApp with a home page.
// 3. The CallHomePage widget displays a button to start a video call.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the CometChat.startCall method is called,
//    initiating a video call with the specified user ID.
// 5. The call options can be customized as needed.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

## Summary of Application Flow

// The application starts by initializing CometChat with the provided credentials.
// Once initialized, it runs the main app, which consists of a simple UI with a button.
// When the user taps the button, it triggers the `CometChat.startCall` method,
// initiating a video call to the specified user ID. The call options can be adjusted
// to customize the call experience further. This setup provides a straightforward
// way to integrate calling features into a Flutter application using the CometChat UI Kit.
