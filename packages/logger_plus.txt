// This is the main entry point of the application.
// The logger is initialized with the debug level and console output.
// The MyApp widget is rendered, which contains the MyHomePage widget.
// The MyHomePage widget contains two buttons: one for logging a debug message and one for logging an error message.
// When a button is pressed, the corresponding log message is written to the console.

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user presses a button.
// 2. The onPressed callback is called.
// 3. The log message is written to the console using the LoggerPlus.log() method.
// 4. The log message is displayed in the console.

In summary, the code flows as follows:

1.  The user presses a button.
2.  The onPressed callback is called.
3.  The log message is written to the console using the `LoggerPlus.log()` method.
4.  The log message is displayed in the console.

This demonstrates the basic usage of the `logger_plus` package in a Flutter application.
