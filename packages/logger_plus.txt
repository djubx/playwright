# Logger Plus: A Comprehensive Overview

The `logger_plus` package is a powerful logging utility for Flutter applications that enhances the debugging experience by providing a simple and flexible way to log messages. It is particularly useful for developers who want to keep track of application behavior, errors, and performance metrics in a structured manner.

## When to Use Logger Plus
- **Debugging**: When you need to track down issues in your application.
- **Performance Monitoring**: To log performance metrics and analyze the app's behavior over time.
- **Error Tracking**: To capture and log errors for better troubleshooting.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Log Levels**: Supports various log levels such as verbose, debug, info, warning, error, and wtf (what a terrible failure).
- **Pretty Print**: Outputs logs in a human-readable format, making it easier to understand.
- **File Logging**: Option to log messages to a file for persistent storage.
- **Log Filtering**: Ability to filter logs based on log levels.
- **Integration with Flutter**: Seamlessly integrates with Flutter's logging system.

Overall, `logger_plus` is an essential tool for any Flutter developer looking to improve their logging capabilities and enhance the debugging process.

# Logger Plus: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To add `logger_plus` to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  logger_plus: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you plan to log to a file. You may need to add:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save logs.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use `logger_plus`, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:logger_plus/logger_plus.dart';
```

Then, you can create an instance of the logger and start logging:

```dart
final logger = LoggerPlus();

void main() {
  logger.i("This is an info log");
  logger.e("This is an error log");
}
```

You can customize the logger's behavior by setting different log levels and formats. For example:

```dart
final logger = LoggerPlus(
  level: Level.debug,
  printer: PrettyPrinter(),
);
```

This setup will allow you to see debug logs in a pretty format.

## Conclusion
With `logger_plus`, you can easily implement logging in your Flutter applications, making it easier to debug and monitor your app's performance.

# Complete Example of Logger Plus in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:logger_plus/logger_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Main application class
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create an instance of LoggerPlus
  final LoggerPlus logger = LoggerPlus();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Log an info message when the app starts
    logger.i("RealFlutter app started");

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Logger Plus Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Logger Plus Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log a debug message when the button is pressed
              logger.d("Button pressed!");
              // Simulate an error
              try {
                throw Exception("Simulated error");
              } catch (e) {
                // Log the error
                logger.e("An error occurred: $e");
              }
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. Inside RealFlutter, an instance of LoggerPlus is created.
// 3. When the app starts, an info log is generated indicating that the app has started.
// 4. The app displays a button in the center of the screen.
// 5. When the button is pressed, a debug log is generated.
// 6. An exception is simulated, and if caught, an error log is generated with the error message.
// 7. This demonstrates how to log different types of messages using logger_plus.
