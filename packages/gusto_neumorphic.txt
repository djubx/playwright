# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Gusto Neumorphic

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **gusto_neumorphic** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gusto_neumorphic: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using Gusto Neumorphic Widgets

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using its widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use a neumorphic button:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gusto_neumorphic/gusto_neumorphic.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: NeumorphicButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Handle button press
          },
          style: NeumorphicStyle(
            depth: 8, // Changes the depth of the button
            color: Colors.grey[300], // Background color
            shape: NeumorphicShape.convex, // Button shape
          ),
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple neumorphic button that responds to user interaction. You can customize the `NeumorphicStyle` properties to achieve the desired look and feel.

## Step 4: Running Your Application

After implementing the above code, run your application using:

```bash
flutter run
```

You should see a neumorphic button in the center of the screen. Pressing the button will trigger the `onPressed` callback.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the **gusto_neumorphic** package into your Flutter application and start creating beautiful, modern UIs.

# Complete Example of Gusto Neumorphic in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gusto_neumorphic/gusto_neumorphic.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gusto Neumorphic Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: NeumorphicHome(),
    );
  }
}

class NeumorphicHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Neumorphic Design'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            NeumorphicButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action for the first button
                print('First Button Pressed');
              },
              style: NeumorphicStyle(
                depth: 8, // Depth of the button
                color: Colors.grey[300], // Background color
                shape: NeumorphicShape.convex, // Button shape
              ),
              child: Text('First Button'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between buttons
            NeumorphicButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action for the second button
                print('Second Button Pressed');
              },
              style: NeumorphicStyle(
                depth: 8, // Depth of the button
                color: Colors.grey[300], // Background color
                shape: NeumorphicShape.convex, // Button shape
              ),
              child: Text('Second Button'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home widget is NeumorphicHome, which contains the main UI.
// 4. NeumorphicHome builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange two NeumorphicButtons vertically.
// 6. Each button has an onPressed callback that prints a message to the console when pressed.
// 7. The NeumorphicStyle is applied to each button, giving them a soft, 3D appearance.
```
