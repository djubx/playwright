Here's a detailed technical blog on the "event_taxi" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Event Taxi Flutter Package

The **event_taxi** package is a powerful tool for managing event-driven communication in Flutter applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to implement a publish-subscribe pattern, allowing different parts of your application to communicate without tight coupling. This is particularly useful in large applications where components need to interact but should remain independent.

## When to Use Event Taxi

You should consider using the **event_taxi** package in scenarios such as:

- **Decoupled Communication**: When you want to allow different parts of your application to communicate without direct references to each other.
- **Event Handling**: When you need to handle events that can occur at various points in your application, such as user interactions, data updates, or system notifications.
- **State Management**: When you want to manage state changes across different widgets without relying on a single state management solution.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: The package is lightweight and easy to integrate into existing projects.
- **Flexible**: Supports multiple event types and allows for custom event classes.
- **Asynchronous**: Built to handle asynchronous events, making it suitable for modern Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Event Taxi

## Step 1: Adding Dependency

To get started with the **event_taxi** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  event_taxi: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:event_taxi/event_taxi.dart';
```

## Step 3: Creating Event Classes

You can create custom event classes that extend `EventTaxi`. For example:

```dart
class MyCustomEvent implements EventTaxi {
  final String message;

  MyCustomEvent(this.message);
}
```

## Step 4: Publishing Events

To publish an event, use the `EventTaxi` instance:

```dart
EventTaxi().fire(MyCustomEvent("Hello from Event Taxi!"));
```

## Step 5: Subscribing to Events

To listen for events, you can subscribe to them in your widgets:

```dart
EventTaxi().subscribe<MyCustomEvent>((event) {
  print(event.message);
});
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

Ensure that your Android project is set up to use Kotlin if you are using any Kotlin-specific features. Update your `android/app/build.gradle` file to include:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 6: Optimizations

- **Event Filtering**: You can filter events based on specific criteria to reduce unnecessary processing.
- **Unsubscribing**: Always unsubscribe from events when they are no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.

# Complete Example of Using Event Taxi

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:event_taxi/event_taxi.dart';

// Custom event class to hold the message
class MyCustomEvent implements EventTaxi {
  final String message;

  MyCustomEvent(this.message);
}

// Main application class
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Event Taxi Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _message = "No message received yet.";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Subscribe to MyCustomEvent
    EventTaxi().subscribe<MyCustomEvent>((event) {
      setState(() {
        _message = event.message; // Update the message when event is received
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Unsubscribe from events to prevent memory leaks
    EventTaxi().unsubscribe<MyCustomEvent>();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Event Taxi Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_message), // Display the received message
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Publish a new event when the button is pressed
                EventTaxi().fire(MyCustomEvent("Hello from Event Taxi!"));
              },
              child: Text('Send Event'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, which initializes a message variable.
// 3. In the initState method, the HomeScreen subscribes to MyCustomEvent.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a new MyCustomEvent is published with a message.
// 5. The subscribed listener updates the _message variable, which triggers a UI rebuild.
// 6. The new message is displayed on the screen.
// 7. When the HomeScreen is disposed, it unsubscribes from the event to prevent memory leaks.
```
