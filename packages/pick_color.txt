## Setup Process

To get started with the `pick_color` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `pick_color` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     pick_color: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions if you plan to access the camera or photo library for color selection:

     ```xml
     <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
     <string>We need access to your photo library to select colors.</string>
     <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
     <string>We need access to your camera to select colors.</string>
     ```

## Using the Package

To use the `pick_color` package in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:pick_color/pick_color.dart';
   ```

2. **Implement the Color Picker**: You can create a simple color picker widget using the `PickColor` class provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

   ```dart
   PickColor(
     onColorSelected: (Color color) {
       // Handle the selected color
     },
   );
   ```

3. **Customize the Picker**: You can customize the appearance and behavior of the color picker by passing additional parameters to the `PickColor` widget.

By following these steps, you can easily integrate the `pick_color` package into your Flutter application and provide users with a seamless color selection experience.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pick_color/pick_color.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Color Picker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ColorPickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ColorPickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ColorPickerScreenState createState() => _ColorPickerScreenState();
}

class _ColorPickerScreenState extends State<ColorPickerScreen> {
  Color selectedColor = Colors.blue; // Default color

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Color Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the currently selected color
            Container(
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              color: selectedColor,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Selected Color',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open the color picker
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Open the color picker and wait for the selected color
                Color? color = await showDialog<Color>(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (BuildContext context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Pick a Color'),
                      content: SingleChildScrollView(
                        child: PickColor(
                          onColorSelected: (Color color) {
                            Navigator.of(context).pop(color); // Return selected color
                          },
                        ),
                      ),
                    );
                  },
                );

                // Update the state with the selected color
                if (color != null) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedColor = color; // Update the selected color
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Open Color Picker'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is ColorPickerScreen, which manages the state of the selected color.
// 4. The selected color is displayed in a container, and a button is provided to open the color picker.
// 5. When the button is pressed, an AlertDialog is shown with the PickColor widget.
// 6. The user selects a color, which is returned to the ColorPickerScreen.
// 7. The state is updated with the new color, and the UI reflects the change.
