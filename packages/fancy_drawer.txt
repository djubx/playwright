# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Fancy Drawer

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **fancy_drawer** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **fancy_drawer** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fancy_drawer: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using Fancy Drawer

Now that we have set up the package, let's implement it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to use the **fancy_drawer** package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fancy_drawer/fancy_drawer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fancy Drawer Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Declare a GlobalKey for the FancyDrawer
  final GlobalKey<FancyDrawerState> _drawerKey = GlobalKey<FancyDrawerState>();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FancyDrawer(
      key: _drawerKey,
      // The main content of the app
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Fancy Drawer Example'),
          // Open the drawer when the button is pressed
          leading: IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
            onPressed: () {
              _drawerKey.currentState?.openDrawer();
            },
          ),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Welcome to the Fancy Drawer Example!'),
        ),
      ),
      // The drawer content
      drawer: Container(
        width: 250,
        color: Colors.blueAccent,
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Drawer header
            Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
              child: Text(
                'Fancy Drawer',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ),
            // Drawer items
            ListTile(
              title: Text('Home', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
              onTap: () {
                // Handle navigation
                Navigator.pop(context);
              },
            ),
            ListTile(
              title: Text('Settings', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
              onTap: () {
                // Handle navigation
                Navigator.pop(context);
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to RealFlutter, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In RealFlutter, we create a GlobalKey for the FancyDrawer to control its state.
// 5. The build method returns a FancyDrawer widget, which contains a Scaffold.
// 6. The AppBar has a menu button that opens the drawer when pressed.
// 7. The body of the Scaffold displays a welcome message.
// 8. The drawer contains a header and two list items for navigation.
// 9. Tapping on a list item will close the drawer and can be extended to navigate to different screens.
