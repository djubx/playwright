// Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:
// 1. We create a material app with a title and a theme.
// 2. We create a stateful widget called RealFlutter.
// 3. We create an instance of the OverlayManager class.
// 4. We define a button that, when pressed, will show an overlay with a text widget.
// 5. We use the overlay manager's showOverlay method to display the overlay.
// 6. The overlay will be displayed on top of the current activity (on Android) or view controller (on iOS).

// And that's it! With this code, you should be able to display an overlay with a text widget using the overlay manager package.
