# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `list_picker` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `list_picker` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  list_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the `list_picker` in Your Application

You can now use the `list_picker` in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it.

# Complete Example of Using `list_picker`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:list_picker/list_picker.dart'; // Import the list_picker package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'List Picker Example',
      home: ListPickerExample(), // Set the home widget
    );
  }
}

class ListPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ListPickerExampleState createState() => _ListPickerExampleState();
}

class _ListPickerExampleState extends State<ListPickerExample> {
  List<String> items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Elderberry']; // List of items
  List<String> selectedItems = []; // List to hold selected items

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('List Picker Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Show the list picker when the button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (BuildContext context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Select Fruits'), // Dialog title
                      content: ListPicker<String>(
                        items: items, // Pass the list of items
                        selectedItems: selectedItems, // Pass the selected items
                        onChanged: (selected) {
                          setState(() {
                            selectedItems = selected; // Update selected items
                          });
                        },
                      ),
                      actions: [
                        TextButton(
                          onPressed: () {
                            Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                          },
                          child: Text('Done'), // Done button
                        ),
                      ],
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Pick Fruits'), // Button text
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Selected: ${selectedItems.join(', ')}'), // Display selected items
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. ListPickerExample is a stateful widget that manages the list of items and selected items.
// 4. When the "Pick Fruits" button is pressed, an AlertDialog is shown with the ListPicker.
// 5. The ListPicker displays the list of fruits and allows multiple selections.
// 6. When the user selects items, the selectedItems list is updated.
// 7. The "Done" button closes the dialog, and the selected items are displayed on the screen.
