# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using switch_tab

## Installation

To get started with the `switch_tab` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  switch_tab: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `switch_tab` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:switch_tab/switch_tab.dart';
```

You can then create a simple tabbed interface using the `SwitchTab` widget. Here’s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
SwitchTab(
  tabs: [
    Tab(text: 'Home'),
    Tab(text: 'Settings'),
  ],
  views: [
    HomeView(),
    SettingsView(),
  ],
)
```

This will create a tabbed interface with two tabs: Home and Settings, each linked to its respective view.

# Complete Example of switch_tab in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:switch_tab/switch_tab.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Switch Tab Example',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Switch Tab Example'),
      ),
      body: SwitchTab(
        // Define the tabs for navigation
        tabs: [
          Tab(text: 'Home'), // First tab
          Tab(text: 'Settings'), // Second tab
        ],
        // Define the views corresponding to each tab
        views: [
          HomeView(), // View for the Home tab
          SettingsView(), // View for the Settings tab
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// HomeView widget displaying content for the Home tab
class HomeView extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text(
        'Welcome to the Home Page!',
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// SettingsView widget displaying content for the Settings tab
class SettingsView extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text(
        'Adjust your settings here.',
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets MyHomePage as the home widget.
3. MyHomePage contains an AppBar and a SwitchTab widget.
4. The SwitchTab widget defines two tabs: 'Home' and 'Settings'.
5. Each tab is linked to a corresponding view: HomeView and SettingsView.
6. HomeView displays a welcome message, while SettingsView prompts the user to adjust settings.
7. When a user taps on a tab, the SwitchTab widget handles the transition and displays the appropriate view.
