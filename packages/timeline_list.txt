# Overview of the `timeline_list` Flutter Package

The `timeline_list` package is a powerful Flutter library designed to create visually appealing timelines in your applications. Timelines are a great way to present events in a chronological order, making it easier for users to understand the sequence of events or milestones. This package is particularly useful for applications that require a historical overview, project milestones, or any scenario where a timeline representation enhances user experience.

## When to Use `timeline_list`

You might consider using the `timeline_list` package in scenarios such as:
- **Event Tracking**: Displaying a series of events, such as a project timeline or historical events.
- **Milestone Representation**: Showcasing key milestones in a project or personal journey.
- **Storytelling**: Creating a narrative flow for applications that require a chronological presentation of information.

## Features

- **Customizable Timeline**: Easily customize the appearance of the timeline, including colors, shapes, and icons.
- **Vertical and Horizontal Layouts**: Supports both vertical and horizontal timelines, allowing flexibility in design.
- **Interactive Elements**: Add interactivity to timeline items, such as tapping for more information or navigating to different screens.
- **Responsive Design**: The package is designed to work well on various screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience across devices.

With these features, the `timeline_list` package provides a robust solution for developers looking to implement timelines in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `timeline_list` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `timeline_list` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  timeline_list: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a timeline using the `timeline_list` package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:timeline_list/timeline_list.dart';
```

2. Create a list of timeline events:

```dart
final List<TimelineModel> timelineItems = [
  TimelineModel(
    title: "Event 1",
    description: "Description of Event 1",
    icon: Icons.event,
    date: "2024-01-01",
  ),
  TimelineModel(
    title: "Event 2",
    description: "Description of Event 2",
    icon: Icons.event,
    date: "2024-02-01",
  ),
  // Add more events as needed
];
```

3. Use the `Timeline` widget to display the events:

```dart
Timeline(
  children: timelineItems.map((item) {
    return TimelineTile(
      title: item.title,
      subtitle: item.description,
      icon: Icon(item.icon),
      date: item.date,
    );
  }).toList(),
);
```

With these steps, you can create a basic timeline in your Flutter application. Customize the appearance and behavior as needed to fit your app's design.

# Complete Example of Using the `timeline_list` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timeline_list/timeline_list.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Timeline List Example',
      home: TimelinePage(),
    );
  }
}

class TimelinePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a list of timeline events
    final List<TimelineModel> timelineItems = [
      TimelineModel(
        title: "Event 1",
        description: "Description of Event 1",
        icon: Icons.event,
        date: "2024-01-01",
      ),
      TimelineModel(
        title: "Event 2",
        description: "Description of Event 2",
        icon: Icons.event,
        date: "2024-02-01",
      ),
      TimelineModel(
        title: "Event 3",
        description: "Description of Event 3",
        icon: Icons.event,
        date: "2024-03-01",
      ),
    ];

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Timeline Example'),
      ),
      body: Timeline(
        children: timelineItems.map((item) {
          return TimelineTile(
            title: item.title,
            subtitle: item.description,
            icon: Icon(item.icon),
            date: item.date,
          );
        }).toList(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page set to TimelinePage.
// 3. TimelinePage creates a list of TimelineModel objects representing events.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a structure with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a Timeline widget that displays the events.
// 6. Each TimelineModel is converted into a TimelineTile, which shows the title, description, icon, and date.
// 7. The app displays a vertical timeline of events, allowing users to see the sequence of events clearly.
