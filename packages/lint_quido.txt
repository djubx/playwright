# Setting Up Lint Quido: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Installation
To get started with the **lint_quido** package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Follow these steps:

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file.
2. Add the following dependency:

   ```yaml
   dev_dependencies:
     lint_quido: ^latest_version
   ```

3. Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Configuration
After installing the package, you need to configure it to suit your project's needs.

1. Create a new file named `analysis_options.yaml` in the root of your Flutter project.
2. Add your desired lint rules. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

   ```yaml
   include: package:lint_quido/lint.yaml

   linter:
     rules:
       - prefer_single_quotes
       - avoid_print
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
- Ensure that your Android project is set up to use the latest Gradle version to avoid compatibility issues.

### iOS
- For iOS, make sure your Xcode is updated to the latest version to ensure smooth integration.

## Running Linting
To run the linting process, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

This command will analyze your codebase and provide feedback based on the rules defined in your `analysis_options.yaml` file.

By following these steps, you can effectively set up and configure the **lint_quido** package in your Flutter project, ensuring high code quality and maintainability.

# Complete Example of Lint Quido in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Lint Quido Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Lint Quido Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // This is a sample print statement that can be flagged by linting
              print('Hello, Lint Quido!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class extends StatelessWidget, which means it is immutable and can be rebuilt.
// 3. The build method returns a MaterialApp widget, which is the root of the application.
// 4. Inside the MaterialApp, we define the title and theme of the app.
// 5. The home property is set to a Scaffold widget, which provides a structure for the visual interface.
// 6. An AppBar is created with a title, and the body contains a Center widget.
// 7. The Center widget holds an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, executes a print statement.
// 8. The print statement is an example of code that could be flagged by the linting rules defined in analysis_options.yaml.
