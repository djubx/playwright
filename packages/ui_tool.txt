# Setting Up and Using the `ui_tool` Package

## Installation

To add the `ui_tool` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ui_tool: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `ui_tool` package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:ui_tool/ui_tool.dart';
```

You can then start using the pre-built widgets in your Flutter application. For example, to create a simple button using `ui_tool`:

```dart
CustomButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  child: Text('Click Me'),
);
```

This button can be styled and customized using the properties provided by the `ui_tool` package.

# Complete Example of Using the `ui_tool` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ui_tool/ui_tool.dart'; // Importing the ui_tool package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'UI Tool Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue, // Setting the primary color
      ),
      home: HomePage(), // Setting the home page
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('UI Tool Demo'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CustomButton( // Using a CustomButton from ui_tool
          onPressed: () {
            // Action to perform on button press
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                title: Text('Button Pressed!'), // Dialog title
                content: Text('You have pressed the button.'), // Dialog content
                actions: [
                  TextButton(
                    onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(), // Close dialog
                    child: Text('OK'), // Button to close dialog
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home page is set to HomePage, which contains the main UI.
// 4. HomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered CustomButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, an AlertDialog is shown with a message.
// 6. The dialog has an OK button that closes it when pressed.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->
```

### Summary of Application Flow
The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget. This widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with a title and theme, and it designates `HomePage` as the home screen. The `HomePage` contains a `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a centered `CustomButton`. When the button is pressed, an `AlertDialog` appears, confirming the button press, and it can be dismissed by tapping the OK button. This flow demonstrates how to effectively use the `ui_tool` package to create a simple yet interactive UI in Flutter.
