### Setup

To use the `animated_float_action_button` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  animated_float_action_button: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to get the package.

### Basic Usage

To use the package, you need to import it and create an instance of the `AnimatedFloatActionButton` widget:

```dart
import 'package:animated_float_action_button/animated_float_action_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedFloatActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            print('Button pressed!');
          },
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Customization

You can customize the animation duration and curve by using the `animationDuration` and `animationCurve` properties:

```dart
AnimatedFloatActionButton(
  onPressed: () {
    print('Button pressed!');
  },
  child: Icon(Icons.add),
  animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  animationCurve: Curves.easeInOut,
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

The package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to adjust the `animationDuration` and `animationCurve` properties to get the desired animation effect on each platform.

### Required Configurations or Optimizations

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_float_action_button/animated_float_action_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Float Action Button Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a Scaffold with a Center child
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        // Create an AnimatedFloatActionButton with an Icon child
        child: AnimatedFloatActionButton(
          // Set the onPressed callback
          onPressed: () {
            print('Button pressed!');
          },
          // Set the child widget
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
          // Set the animation duration
          animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
          // Set the animation curve
          animationCurve: Curves.easeInOut,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by running the main function, which creates a MyApp instance.
// The MyApp instance creates a MaterialApp with a RealFlutter instance as its home.
// The RealFlutter instance creates a Scaffold with a Center child.
// The Center child contains an AnimatedFloatActionButton with an Icon child.
// When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is called, printing 'Button pressed!' to the console.
// The animation duration and curve are set to 500 milliseconds and easeInOut, respectively.
