# Overview of the sat_scraping Flutter Package

The `sat_scraping` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to scrape data from websites. This package simplifies the process of extracting information from HTML documents, making it easier to gather data for applications that require web content. 

## When to Use This Package
- **Data Collection**: When you need to gather data from websites for analysis or display in your app.
- **Content Aggregation**: If your app aggregates content from multiple sources, `sat_scraping` can help you pull in that data efficiently.
- **Dynamic Content**: For applications that require real-time data from web pages, this package can facilitate scraping.

## Features
- **HTML Parsing**: Easily parse HTML documents to extract specific elements.
- **XPath Support**: Utilize XPath queries to navigate through the HTML structure.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Perform scraping operations asynchronously to keep your app responsive.
- **Customizable**: Tailor the scraping process to fit your specific needs with flexible configurations.

Overall, `sat_scraping` is an essential package for Flutter developers looking to integrate web scraping capabilities into their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using sat_scraping

## Installation
To get started with the `sat_scraping` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sat_scraping: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have internet permissions set in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow arbitrary loads:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `sat_scraping` package, you will typically follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:sat_scraping/sat_scraping.dart';
   ```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class (or your custom class) to manage scraping operations.

3. Use the provided methods to fetch and parse HTML content.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to scrape data from a website:

```dart
void main() async {
  // Create an instance of the RealFlutter class
  RealFlutter scraper = RealFlutter();

  // Fetch HTML content from a URL
  String url = 'https://example.com';
  String htmlContent = await scraper.fetchHtml(url);

  // Parse the HTML content
  var parsedData = scraper.parseHtml(htmlContent, '//h1/text()');

  // Print the scraped data
  print(parsedData);
}
```

This example demonstrates fetching HTML content from a specified URL and extracting the text of the first `<h1>` element using an XPath query.

With these steps, you can effectively set up and utilize the `sat_scraping` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using sat_scraping

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sat_scraping/sat_scraping.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Web Scraping Example',
      home: ScrapingPage(),
    );
  }
}

class ScrapingPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ScrapingPageState createState() => _ScrapingPageState();
}

class _ScrapingPageState extends State<ScrapingPage> {
  String scrapedData = 'Fetching data...'; // Placeholder for scraped data

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    fetchData(); // Call the fetchData method when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Method to fetch and parse data
  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    RealFlutter scraper = RealFlutter(); // Create an instance of RealFlutter
    String url = 'https://example.com'; // URL to scrape data from

    // Fetch HTML content from the URL
    String htmlContent = await scraper.fetchHtml(url);

    // Parse the HTML content using XPath
    var parsedData = scraper.parseHtml(htmlContent, '//h1/text()');

    // Update the state with the scraped data
    setState(() {
      scrapedData = parsedData.isNotEmpty ? parsedData[0] : 'No data found';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Web Scraping Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(scrapedData), // Display the scraped data
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The ScrapingPage widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. In the _ScrapingPageState, the fetchData method is called during initState.
// 4. fetchData creates an instance of RealFlutter and fetches HTML content from the specified URL.
// 5. The HTML content is parsed to extract the text of the first <h1> element using XPath.
// 6. The state is updated with the scraped data, which is then displayed in the center of the screen.
