# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Circular Widgets

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the **circular_widgets** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  circular_widgets: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:circular_widgets/circular_widgets.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Circular Widgets
You can now use the circular widgets in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a circular button:

```dart
CircularButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Action when button is pressed
  },
  color: Colors.blue,
  size: 60.0,
  child: Icon(Icons.add, color: Colors.white),
);
```

This button will have a blue circular background with a white plus icon in the center.

# Complete Example of Circular Widgets

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:circular_widgets/circular_widgets.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Circular Widgets Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Circular Widgets Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Creating a circular button
              CircularButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action when button is pressed
                  print('Circular Button Pressed!');
                },
                color: Colors.blue,
                size: 80.0,
                child: Icon(Icons.add, color: Colors.white),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between buttons
              // Creating a circular image
              CircularImage(
                image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/profile.jpg'),
                size: 100.0,
                borderColor: Colors.blue,
                borderWidth: 4.0,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Circular Widgets Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, a CircularButton is created with an onPressed action that prints a message to the console.
// 6. A SizedBox is used to add space between the button and the next widget.
// 7. A CircularImage widget is created to display a circular profile image from a network URL.
// 8. The CircularImage has a border defined by the borderColor and borderWidth properties.
