Here's a detailed technical blog on the "text_form_field_validator" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `text_form_field_validator` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of validating user input in text fields. It provides a set of pre-defined validators that can be easily integrated into your forms, ensuring that the data collected from users meets specific criteria before submission.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `text_form_field_validator` package when:
- You need to validate user input in forms, such as login or registration forms.
- You want to ensure that the data entered by users adheres to specific formats (e.g., email, password strength).
- You prefer a clean and maintainable codebase by utilizing reusable validation logic.

## Features
- **Pre-defined Validators**: Includes common validators like email, password, and required field checks.
- **Custom Validators**: Allows you to create your own validation logic.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate with Flutter's `TextFormField` widget.
- **Error Handling**: Automatically displays error messages when validation fails.

By leveraging this package, developers can enhance user experience by providing immediate feedback on input errors, thus improving the overall quality of data collected.

# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `text_form_field_validator` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     text_form_field_validator: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
   - **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure you have the latest version of Xcode.

## Using the Package

To use the `text_form_field_validator`, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:text_form_field_validator/text_form_field_validator.dart';
   ```

2. **Create a Form**: Use the `TextFormField` widget along with the validators provided by the package. Hereâ€™s an example of how to implement a simple form with validation:

   ```dart
   TextFormField(
     validator: EmailValidator(errorText: 'Enter a valid email'),
     decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
   )
   ```

3. **Custom Validators**: If the pre-defined validators do not meet your needs, you can create custom validators. For example:

   ```dart
   String? customValidator(String? value) {
     if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
       return 'This field cannot be empty';
     }
     return null; // Return null if validation passes
   }
   ```

4. **Form Submission**: Handle form submission by checking if the form is valid:

   ```dart
   if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) {
     // Process data
   }
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively implement form validation in your Flutter applications using the `text_form_field_validator` package.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_form_field_validator/text_form_field_validator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Text Form Field Validator Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Form Validation Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: MyForm(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyFormState createState() => _MyFormState();
}

class _MyFormState extends State<MyForm> {
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>(); // Key to identify the form

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Form(
      key: _formKey, // Assign the key to the form
      child: Column(
        children: <Widget>[
          // Email field with validation
          TextFormField(
            validator: EmailValidator(errorText: 'Enter a valid email'), // Email validation
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
          ),
          // Password field with validation
          TextFormField(
            validator: RequiredValidator(errorText: 'Password is required'), // Required field validation
            obscureText: true, // Hide password input
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Password'),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between fields and button
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Validate the form
              if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) {
                // If the form is valid, display a snackbar
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Processing Data')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Submit'), // Button to submit the form
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body contains a Padding widget that wraps the MyForm widget.
// 4. MyForm is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the form.
// 5. The form is created with a GlobalKey to manage its state and validation.
// 6. Two TextFormField widgets are created: one for email and one for password, each with their respective validators.
// 7. An ElevatedButton is provided to submit the form. When pressed, it validates the form.
// 8. If the form is valid, a SnackBar is displayed indicating that the data is being processed.
