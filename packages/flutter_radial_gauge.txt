# Flutter Radial Gauge Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_radial_gauge` package is a powerful Flutter library that allows developers to create beautiful and customizable radial gauges. These gauges can be used to represent various types of data visually, such as performance metrics, speedometers, or any other value that can be represented in a circular format. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the `flutter_radial_gauge` package in scenarios such as:
- Displaying real-time data in a visually appealing way.
- Creating dashboards for applications that require monitoring of metrics.
- Building interactive applications where user input can change the gauge's value.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily customize the gauge's colors, labels, and ticks to match your application's theme.
- **Multiple Gauge Types**: Supports different types of gauges, including linear and circular.
- **Animation Support**: Provides smooth animations for value changes, enhancing user experience.
- **Interactive**: Allows user interaction, enabling users to change values directly on the gauge.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

Overall, the `flutter_radial_gauge` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to add visually appealing and functional gauges to their Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Radial Gauge Package

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_radial_gauge` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_radial_gauge: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_radial_gauge).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a radial gauge:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_radial_gauge/flutter_radial_gauge.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Radial Gauge Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: RadialGauge(
            axes: [
              RadialAxis(
                minimum: 0,
                maximum: 100,
                ranges: [
                  GaugeRange(startValue: 0, endValue: 50, color: Colors.green),
                  GaugeRange(startValue: 50, endValue: 75, color: Colors.yellow),
                  GaugeRange(startValue: 75, endValue: 100, color: Colors.red),
                ],
                pointers: [
                  NeedlePointer(value: 70),
                ],
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple radial gauge with three color ranges and a needle pointer indicating a value of 70. 

With this setup, you can start building more complex gauges by adding more features and customizations as needed.

# Complete Example of Flutter Radial Gauge

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Radial Gauge Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: RadialGauge(
            // Define the axes for the radial gauge
            axes: [
              RadialAxis(
                minimum: 0, // Minimum value of the gauge
                maximum: 100, // Maximum value of the gauge
                ranges: [
                  // Define color ranges for the gauge
                  GaugeRange(startValue: 0, endValue: 50, color: Colors.green),
                  GaugeRange(startValue: 50, endValue: 75, color: Colors.yellow),
                  GaugeRange(startValue: 75, endValue: 100, color: Colors.red),
                ],
                pointers: [
                  // Define the needle pointer
                  NeedlePointer(value: 70), // Set the needle value
                ],
                annotations: [
                  // Add annotations to display the current value
                  GaugeAnnotation(
                    widget: Text(
                      '70',
                      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                    ),
                    positionFactor: 0.5, // Position of the annotation
                    angle: 90, // Angle of the annotation
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a RadialGauge is created with a single RadialAxis.
// 4. The RadialAxis is configured with a minimum and maximum value, along with three color ranges to indicate different levels.
// 5. A NeedlePointer is added to represent the current value (70) on the gauge.
// 6. An annotation is included to display the current value in the center of the gauge.
// 7. The application is responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes, providing a visually appealing gauge.
