# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `introduction_slider` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `introduction_slider` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  introduction_slider: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `introduction_slider` in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:introduction_slider/introduction_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Introduction Slider Demo',
      home: IntroductionSlider(
        slides: [
          // Slide 1
          Slide(
            title: "Welcome to RealFlutter",
            description: "This is an introduction to our app.",
            backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
          ),
          // Slide 2
          Slide(
            title: "Feature 1",
            description: "Learn about our first feature.",
            backgroundColor: Colors.green,
          ),
          // Slide 3
          Slide(
            title: "Feature 2",
            description: "Discover our second feature.",
            backgroundColor: Colors.red,
          ),
        ],
        onDone: () {
          // Navigate to the main application screen
          Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
            MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => MainScreen()),
          );
        },
        onSkip: () {
          // Navigate to the main application screen
          Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
            MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => MainScreen()),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Main application screen after the introduction
class MainScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Main Screen"),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text("Welcome to the main application!"),
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
  Application Flow Explanation:
  1. The app starts with the `main()` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
  2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a MaterialApp with an `IntroductionSlider` as the home.
  3. The `IntroductionSlider` contains three slides, each with a title and description.
  4. When the user reaches the last slide and clicks "Done" or "Skip", they are navigated to the `MainScreen`.
  5. The `MainScreen` displays a simple message welcoming the user to the main application.
