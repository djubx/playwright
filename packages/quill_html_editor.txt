# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Quill HTML Editor

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **quill_html_editor** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **quill_html_editor** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  quill_html_editor: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/quill_html_editor).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the `NSAppTransportSecurity` settings in your `Info.plist` file to allow HTTP requests if your application requires it:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple Flutter application that uses the Quill HTML Editor.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:quill_html_editor/quill_html_editor.dart';
```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the editor:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Controller for the Quill editor
  QuillEditorController _controller = QuillEditorController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Quill HTML Editor Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Quill Editor
          QuillHtmlEditor(
            controller: _controller,
            height: 400,
            toolbar: QuillToolbar.basic(),
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Get the HTML content from the editor
              String htmlContent = _controller.getHtml();
              print(htmlContent); // Print the HTML content
            },
            child: Text('Get HTML Content'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Quill HTML editor with a toolbar and a button to retrieve the HTML content.

# Complete Example of Quill HTML Editor

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:quill_html_editor/quill_html_editor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Quill HTML Editor Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Controller for the Quill editor
  QuillEditorController _controller = QuillEditorController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Quill HTML Editor Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Quill Editor
          QuillHtmlEditor(
            controller: _controller, // Assign the controller to the editor
            height: 400, // Set the height of the editor
            toolbar: QuillToolbar.basic(), // Use a basic toolbar
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Get the HTML content from the editor
              String htmlContent = _controller.getHtml();
              print(htmlContent); // Print the HTML content to the console
            },
            child: Text('Get HTML Content'), // Button to retrieve HTML
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a stateful widget that creates a Quill editor using QuillHtmlEditor.
// 4. The Quill editor is controlled by _controller, which allows us to retrieve the HTML content.
// 5. The editor is displayed with a basic toolbar for text formatting options.
// 6. An ElevatedButton is provided to get the HTML content from the editor when pressed.
// 7. When the button is pressed, the HTML content is printed to the console.
```
