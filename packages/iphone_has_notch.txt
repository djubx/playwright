# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the iPhone Has Notch Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `iphone_has_notch` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  iphone_has_notch: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your app's `Info.plist` file includes the following key to allow for proper notch detection:

```xml
<key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>
<true/>
```

This setting allows the app to manage the status bar appearance based on the view controller, which is essential for accurate notch detection.

### Android Configuration

While the package is primarily focused on iOS, it is good practice to ensure that your Android app is set up correctly. Make sure your `AndroidManifest.xml` includes the following:

```xml
<application
    android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
    android:theme="@style/AppTheme">
    ...
</application>
```

This ensures that your app can handle various network requests without issues.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to check if the device has a notch:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iphone_has_notch/iphone_has_notch.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Check if the device has a notch
    bool hasNotch = IphoneHasNotch.hasNotch;

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('iPhone Has Notch Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            hasNotch ? 'This device has a notch!' : 'This device does not have a notch!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the necessary packages, check for a notch, and display a message accordingly.

# Complete Example: Main File

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iphone_has_notch/iphone_has_notch.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Check if the device has a notch
    bool hasNotch = IphoneHasNotch.hasNotch;

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('iPhone Has Notch Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            hasNotch ? 'This device has a notch!' : 'This device does not have a notch!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function takes an instance of RealFlutter and starts the app.
// 3. In the RealFlutter class, we build the UI using the MaterialApp widget.
// 4. We check if the device has a notch using the IphoneHasNotch.hasNotch property.
// 5. Based on the result, we display a message in the center of the screen indicating whether the device has a notch or not.
// 6. The AppBar displays the title of the application at the top of the screen.
```
