# Eko Jitsi Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the eko_jitsi package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To get started, add the eko_jitsi package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  eko_jitsi: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/eko_jitsi).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys for camera and microphone usage:
   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your microphone for audio during calls.</string>
   ```

## Basic Usage

To use the eko_jitsi package, you can create a simple video call interface. Hereâ€™s how to initiate a video call:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:eko_jitsi/eko_jitsi.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Eko Jitsi Video Call')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Start a video call with a unique room name
              JitsiMeet.joinMeeting(
                roomName: 'testRoom',
                userDisplayName: 'User Name',
              );
            },
            child: Text('Join Video Call'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a button that, when pressed, initiates a video call in a room named "testRoom".

# Eko Jitsi Flutter Package: Complete Example

Here is a complete example of a Flutter application using the eko_jitsi package. This example demonstrates how to set up a video call and manage participants.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:eko_jitsi/eko_jitsi.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Eko Jitsi Video Call')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Start a video call with a unique room name
              JitsiMeet.joinMeeting(
                roomName: 'testRoom',
                userDisplayName: 'User Name',
                userEmail: 'user@example.com', // Optional
                userAvatarURL: 'https://example.com/avatar.png', // Optional
              );
            },
            child: Text('Join Video Call'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with a MaterialApp widget that contains a Scaffold.
// 2. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 3. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, calls the JitsiMeet.joinMeeting method.
// 5. The joinMeeting method takes parameters such as roomName, userDisplayName, userEmail, and userAvatarURL to customize the video call experience.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the user is taken to the video call interface in the specified room.
