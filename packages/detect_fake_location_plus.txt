## When to Use This Package
- **Ride-Sharing Applications**: To ensure that drivers are at the correct location.
- **Location-Based Games**: To prevent cheating by detecting fake GPS locations.
- **Geolocation Services**: To maintain the integrity of user data and prevent fraud.

## Key Features
- **Detection of Spoofed Locations**: The package can identify if the location data is coming from a fake source.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick implementation in existing projects.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Detect Fake Location Plus

## Installation
To get started with the `detect_fake_location_plus` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  detect_fake_location_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/detect_fake_location_plus).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the package, you can follow these steps in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:detect_fake_location_plus/detect_fake_location_plus.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and call the necessary methods to check for fake locations.

This package provides a straightforward API to check the authenticity of the location data. 

Now that you have set up the package, let's move on to a complete example demonstrating its usage.

# Complete Example: Using Detect Fake Location Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:detect_fake_location_plus/detect_fake_location_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Detect Fake Location Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _locationStatus = "Checking location...";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _checkLocation();
  }

  // Method to check the current location
  Future<void> _checkLocation() async {
    // Create an instance of the DetectFakeLocation class
    DetectFakeLocation fakeLocationDetector = DetectFakeLocation();

    // Get the current location
    bool isFake = await fakeLocationDetector.isFakeLocation();

    // Update the status based on the result
    setState(() {
      _locationStatus = isFake ? "Fake location detected!" : "Location is genuine.";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Detect Fake Location'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _locationStatus,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages its state through _RealFlutterState.
// 4. In the initState method, _checkLocation is called to check the authenticity of the location.
// 5. _checkLocation creates an instance of DetectFakeLocation and calls isFakeLocation to determine if the location is fake.
// 6. The result is used to update the _locationStatus variable, which is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 7. The UI updates to show whether the location is genuine or fake based on the detection result.
