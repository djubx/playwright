# Tutorial: Setting Up Snappy List View

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **snappy_list_view** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **snappy_list_view** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  snappy_list_view: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using Snappy List View

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple Flutter application that uses the **snappy_list_view**. 

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:snappy_list_view/snappy_list_view.dart';
```

2. Create a basic Flutter app structure and use the `SnappyListView` widget to display a list of items.

# Complete Example: Snappy List View in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:snappy_list_view/snappy_list_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Snappy List View Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: SnappyListViewExample(),
    );
  }
}

class SnappyListViewExample extends StatelessWidget {
  // Sample data for the list
  final List<String> items = List.generate(100, (index) => 'Item $index');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Snappy List View'),
      ),
      body: SnappyListView.builder(
        itemCount: items.length, // Total number of items
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          // Building each item in the list
          return Card(
            margin: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
            child: ListTile(
              title: Text(items[index]), // Displaying item text
              onTap: () {
                // Action on item tap
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Tapped on ${items[index]}')),
                );
              },
            ),
          );
        },
        physics: BouncingScrollPhysics(), // Custom scroll physics
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to SnappyListViewExample, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. SnappyListViewExample creates a list of 100 items.
// 5. The SnappyListView.builder is used to create a scrollable list of items.
// 6. Each item is displayed in a Card widget with a ListTile.
// 7. Tapping on an item shows a SnackBar with the tapped item's name.
// 8. The BouncingScrollPhysics provides a snappy scrolling effect.
```
