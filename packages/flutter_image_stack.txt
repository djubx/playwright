# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_image_stack

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `flutter_image_stack` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_image_stack: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions for accessing the photo library if you plan to load images from the user's device. Update your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement an image stack.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_image_stack/flutter_image_stack.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Stack Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ImageStack(
            // List of image URLs or asset paths
            imageList: [
              'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
              'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
              'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
            ],
            // Number of images to show in the stack
            totalCount: 3,
            // Customization options
            imageRadius: 50,
            imageBorderWidth: 2,
            imageBorderColor: Colors.white,
            // Optional: Add a background color
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **ImageStack Widget**: This is the main widget that creates the image stack.
- **imageList**: A list of image URLs or asset paths that you want to display.
- **totalCount**: Specifies how many images to show in the stack.
- **imageRadius**: Sets the radius of the images, creating a circular effect.
- **imageBorderWidth** and **imageBorderColor**: Customize the border around each image.
- **backgroundColor**: Sets a background color for the stack.

With this setup, you can easily create a visually appealing image stack in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_image_stack

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_image_stack/flutter_image_stack.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Stack Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ImageStack(
            // List of image URLs or asset paths
            imageList: [
              'https://example.com/image1.jpg', // First image
              'https://example.com/image2.jpg', // Second image
              'https://example.com/image3.jpg', // Third image
            ],
            // Number of images to show in the stack
            totalCount: 3, // Display all three images
            // Customization options
            imageRadius: 50, // Circular images with a radius of 50
            imageBorderWidth: 2, // Border width of 2 pixels
            imageBorderColor: Colors.white, // White border color
            // Optional: Add a background color
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Light grey background
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the app's visual layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a Center widget is used to center the ImageStack widget.
// 5. The ImageStack widget takes a list of image URLs, the total count of images to display, and customization options for the images.
// 6. The images are displayed in a stacked format, with circular shapes and a white border, all centered in the app's body.
