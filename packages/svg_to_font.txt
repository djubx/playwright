This allows for the use of vector graphics as icons in your Flutter applications, providing scalability and flexibility without losing quality. The package is particularly useful when you want to maintain a consistent icon style across your app while minimizing the number of image assets.

## When to Use This Package
- **Iconography**: When you need to use multiple icons that are designed in SVG format.
- **Performance**: To reduce the number of image files in your project, which can improve loading times and performance.
- **Scalability**: SVGs are vector-based, meaning they can be scaled to any size without losing quality, making them ideal for responsive designs.

## Key Features

# Setting Up and Using the svg_to_font Package

## Installation
To get started with the `svg_to_font` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  svg_to_font: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/svg_to_font).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions if you plan to use any external resources:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Using the Package
After installation, you can start using the package to convert SVG files into a font. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

1. Create a directory in your project to store your SVG files, e.g., `assets/svg/`.
2. Use the command line to run the conversion:
   ```bash
   flutter pub run svg_to_font:svg_to_font --input assets/svg/ --output assets/fonts/ --font-name MyCustomIcons
   ```

This command will generate a font file in the specified output directory.

3. Add the generated font to your `pubspec.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   fonts:
     - family: MyCustomIcons
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/MyCustomIcons.ttf
   ```

4. Now you can use your custom icons in your Flutter widgets:
   ```dart
   Icon(
     IconData(0xe900, fontFamily: 'MyCustomIcons'),
     size: 40,
     color: Colors.blue,
   );
   ```

# Complete Example of Using svg_to_font

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SVG to Font Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('SVG to Font Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Using the custom icon from the generated font
              Icon(
                IconData(0xe900, fontFamily: 'MyCustomIcons'), // Custom icon
                size: 100, // Size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between icons
              Text(
                'Custom Icon from SVG Font', // Text below the icon
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Text style
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'SVG to Font Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, an Icon widget is created using the custom icon from the generated font.
// 6. The IconData constructor is used to specify the icon code (0xe900) and the font family ('MyCustomIcons').
// 7. A Text widget is added below the icon to provide a label.
// 8. The app displays the custom icon and its label in the center of the screen.
