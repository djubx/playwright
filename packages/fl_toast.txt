# fl_toast Flutter Package

The `fl_toast` package is a lightweight and customizable toast notification library for Flutter applications. Toasts are brief messages that pop up on the screen to provide feedback to the user without interrupting their current activity. This package allows developers to easily implement toast notifications in their apps, enhancing user experience by providing timely feedback.

## When to Use `fl_toast`

You should consider using the `fl_toast` package in scenarios such as:
- Displaying success messages after a user action (e.g., form submission).
- Notifying users of errors or warnings (e.g., failed network requests).
- Providing contextual information without requiring user interaction.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily customize the background color, text style, and duration of the toast.
- **Positioning**: Control where the toast appears on the screen (top, center, bottom).
- **Animation**: Smooth animations for showing and hiding toasts.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.

With these features, `fl_toast` provides a robust solution for implementing toast notifications in your Flutter apps.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using fl_toast

## Step 1: Adding Dependency

To get started with `fl_toast`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fl_toast: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using fl_toast in Your Application

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display a toast message:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fl_toast/fl_toast.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('fl_toast Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a toast message when the button is pressed
            FlToast.showToast(
              context: context,
              message: 'Hello, this is a toast message!',
              duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
              position: ToastPosition.bottom,
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Toast'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a toast message will appear at the bottom of the screen for 2 seconds.

# Complete Example of fl_toast

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fl_toast/fl_toast.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the application with the RealFlutter class
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(), // Set the home screen of the app
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('fl_toast Example')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a toast message when the button is pressed
            FlToast.showToast(
              context: context, // Provide the context for the toast
              message: 'Hello, this is a toast message!', // Message to display
              duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration for which the toast is visible
              position: ToastPosition.bottom, // Position of the toast on the screen
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Toast'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter class.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The Center widget holds an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, FlToast.showToast is called to display a toast message.
// 6. The toast appears at the bottom of the screen for 2 seconds, providing feedback to the user.
```
