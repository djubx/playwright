```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:suggest_a_feature/suggest_a_feature.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Suggest a Feature Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  SuggestAFeature _suggestAFeature = SuggestAFeature();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Suggest a Feature Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the suggest a feature dialog
            _suggestAFeature.showDialog(context);
          },
          child: Text('Suggest a Feature'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The user clicks the "Suggest a Feature" button
// 2. The suggest a feature dialog is shown
// 3. The user enters their feature suggestion and clicks submit
// 4. The onSubmitted callback is called with the feature suggestion
// 5. The feature suggestion is received and handled by the developer
```

// Summary: The code flows by first creating a SuggestAFeature instance and configuring it. Then, the suggest a feature dialog is shown when the user clicks the button. The user enters their feature suggestion and clicks submit, which calls the onSubmitted callback with the feature suggestion. Finally, the feature suggestion is received and handled by the developer.
