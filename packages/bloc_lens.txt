// The app starts by creating a new instance of the RealFlutterBloc.
// This bloc is responsible for handling the business logic and data flows of the app.
// The app then creates a new instance of the MyApp widget, passing the bloc as a parameter.
// The MyApp widget uses the BlocBuilder to build the app's UI based on the state of the bloc.
// The BlocBuilder listens to the bloc's events and transitions, and rebuilds the UI accordingly.
// In this example, the UI is a simple Scaffold with an AppBar and a Centered Text widget.
// The Text widget displays the text 'Hello, World!'.
// The app's UI is updated automatically whenever the bloc's state changes.

// This is a basic example of how to use the bloc_lens package in a Flutter app.
// You can add more complex logic and data flows to the bloc as needed.
// You can also use the bloc to handle specific events and states, and optimize its performance.
