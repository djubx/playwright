# Big Decimal Flutter Package

The `big_decimal` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers who need to handle high-precision decimal arithmetic. This package is particularly useful in financial applications, scientific calculations, or any scenario where floating-point precision is critical. 

## When to Use This Package
- **Financial Applications**: When dealing with currency calculations where precision is paramount.
- **Scientific Calculations**: For applications that require high precision in mathematical computations.
- **Data Analysis**: When processing large datasets that involve decimal values.

## Features
- **High Precision**: Supports arbitrary precision for decimal numbers.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with precision.
- **Comparison Operations**: Easily compare decimal values.
- **String Conversion**: Convert between strings and decimal values seamlessly.

The `big_decimal` package is an essential tool for developers looking to ensure accuracy in their applications where decimal values are involved.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Big Decimal Package

## Installation
To use the `big_decimal` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  big_decimal: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No special configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Using the Package
To use the `big_decimal` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:big_decimal/big_decimal.dart';
```

You can then create instances of `BigDecimal` and perform various operations. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void main() {
  BigDecimal a = BigDecimal.fromString("10.5");
  BigDecimal b = BigDecimal.fromString("2.3");

  // Performing addition
  BigDecimal sum = a.add(b);
  print("Sum: $sum"); // Output: Sum: 12.8
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create `BigDecimal` instances and perform basic arithmetic operations. You can explore more operations like subtraction, multiplication, and division similarly.

# Complete Example of Using Big Decimal

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:big_decimal/big_decimal.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Big Decimal Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Big Decimal Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: BigDecimalExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class BigDecimalExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Creating BigDecimal instances
    BigDecimal a = BigDecimal.fromString("10.5");
    BigDecimal b = BigDecimal.fromString("2.3");

    // Performing arithmetic operations
    BigDecimal sum = a.add(b); // Addition
    BigDecimal difference = a.subtract(b); // Subtraction
    BigDecimal product = a.multiply(b); // Multiplication
    BigDecimal quotient = a.divide(b); // Division

    // Displaying results
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text("A: $a"),
        Text("B: $b"),
        Text("Sum: $sum"),
        Text("Difference: $difference"),
        Text("Product: $product"),
        Text("Quotient: $quotient"),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains the BigDecimalExample widget, which performs operations using the big_decimal package.
// 4. Inside BigDecimalExample, two BigDecimal instances (a and b) are created from string values.
// 5. Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are performed on these instances.
// 6. The results of these operations are displayed in a Column widget, centered on the screen.
