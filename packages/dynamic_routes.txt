# Dynamic Routes: A Flutter Package for Flexible Navigation

The `dynamic_routes` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement flexible and dynamic routing in their applications. This package allows you to define routes in a more programmatic way, making it easier to manage complex navigation scenarios, especially in larger applications.

## When to Use `dynamic_routes`

- **Dynamic Navigation**: When your app requires navigation that changes based on user input or data.
- **Complex Routing**: For applications with multiple nested routes or deep linking requirements.
- **Modular Architecture**: When building modular applications where routes can be defined in separate modules.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Route Generation**: Create routes based on runtime data.
- **Nested Routing**: Support for nested routes, allowing for complex navigation structures.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate with existing Flutter applications.
- **Custom Route Transitions**: Define custom animations for route transitions.

# Setting Up and Using the `dynamic_routes` Package

## Installation

To get started with the `dynamic_routes` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dynamic_routes: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations. Typically, no additional configurations are required for routing.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `Info.plist` file is configured correctly, especially if you are using deep linking. You may need to add URL schemes if your app requires it.

## Basic Usage

To use the `dynamic_routes` package, you will need to set up a `Router` and define your routes. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:dynamic_routes/dynamic_routes.dart';
```

2. Define your routes in a `Map`:

```dart
final Map<String, WidgetBuilder> routes = {
  '/home': (context) => HomeScreen(),
  '/details': (context) => DetailsScreen(),
};
```

3. Use the `DynamicRouter` in your `MaterialApp`:

```dart
MaterialApp(
  title: 'Dynamic Routes Example',
  initialRoute: '/home',
  onGenerateRoute: DynamicRouter.generateRoute(routes),
);
```

This setup allows you to navigate to different screens dynamically based on the route name.

# Complete Example of Using `dynamic_routes`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dynamic_routes/dynamic_routes.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define the routes for the application
    final Map<String, WidgetBuilder> routes = {
      '/home': (context) => HomeScreen(),
      '/details': (context) => DetailsScreen(),
    };

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dynamic Routes Example',
      initialRoute: '/home', // Set the initial route
      onGenerateRoute: DynamicRouter.generateRoute(routes), // Use DynamicRouter for route generation
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the details screen when the button is pressed
            Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/details');
          },
          child: Text('Go to Details'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Details screen widget
class DetailsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Details')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is the details screen.'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with defined routes.
// 3. The initial route is set to '/home', which displays the HomeScreen.
// 4. In the HomeScreen, when the button is pressed, it navigates to the DetailsScreen using the route name '/details'.
// 5. The DetailsScreen displays a simple message indicating that the user is on the details page.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->
```

### Summary of Application Flow
The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget. The `MaterialApp` is configured with dynamic routes, allowing navigation between the `HomeScreen` and `DetailsScreen`. When the user taps the button on the `HomeScreen`, the app navigates to the `DetailsScreen`, demonstrating the dynamic routing capabilities of the `dynamic_routes` package. This structure allows for easy expansion and modification of routes as the application grows.
