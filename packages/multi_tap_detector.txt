# Multi Tap Detector Flutter Package

The `multi_tap_detector` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to enhance user interaction by detecting multiple taps on the screen. This package is particularly useful in applications where gesture recognition is crucial, such as games, interactive applications, or any app that requires precise touch input.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `multi_tap_detector` package in scenarios such as:

- **Gaming Applications**: Where multiple taps can trigger different actions or events.
- **Interactive UI Elements**: For applications that require quick responses to user taps, like buttons or sliders.
- **Gesture-Based Navigation**: In apps that utilize gestures for navigation or control.

## Features

- **Multi-Tap Detection**: Detects multiple taps in quick succession.
- **Customizable Tap Thresholds**: Allows developers to set the time interval for what constitutes a "multi-tap."
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to add to any Flutter project with minimal setup.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

With these features, the `multi_tap_detector` package provides a robust solution for enhancing user experience through gesture recognition.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Multi Tap Detector

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `multi_tap_detector` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multi_tap_detector: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:multi_tap_detector/multi_tap_detector.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup

You can use the `MultiTapDetector` widget to wrap around any widget you want to detect taps on. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

```dart
MultiTapDetector(
  onTap: () {
    // Handle single tap
  },
  onDoubleTap: () {
    // Handle double tap
  },
  onTripleTap: () {
    // Handle triple tap
  },
  child: YourWidget(), // Replace with your widget
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to adjust your `Info.plist` to ensure proper permissions for touch events, although typically no special permissions are required for basic tap detection.

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: Ensure that the widget wrapped by `MultiTapDetector` is lightweight to maintain smooth performance.
- **Testing**: Test on various devices to ensure consistent tap detection across different screen sizes and resolutions.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `multi_tap_detector` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Multi Tap Detector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multi_tap_detector/multi_tap_detector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Multi Tap Detector Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Multi Tap Detector'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: MultiTapDetector(
            onTap: () {
              // Handle single tap
              print('Single Tap Detected');
            },
            onDoubleTap: () {
              // Handle double tap
              print('Double Tap Detected');
            },
            onTripleTap: () {
              // Handle triple tap
              print('Triple Tap Detected');
            },
            child: Container(
              width: 200,
              height: 200,
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Tap Me!',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we use MultiTapDetector to wrap a Container.
// 5. The MultiTapDetector listens for single, double, and triple taps.
// 6. When a tap is detected, the corresponding callback is executed, printing a message to the console.
// 7. The Container is styled with a blue background and contains a centered text "Tap Me!".
// 8. Users can interact with the Container, and the app responds to their taps accordingly.
```
