# fcm_channels_manager Flutter Package

The `fcm_channels_manager` package is a powerful tool for managing Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) channels in Flutter applications. It allows developers to create, manage, and utilize different notification channels, which is particularly useful for Android devices. This package simplifies the process of handling notifications, ensuring that users receive timely and relevant updates.

## When to Use This Package
- **Multi-Channel Notifications**: When your application needs to send notifications for different purposes (e.g., promotions, alerts, updates), managing these through separate channels can enhance user experience.
- **User Preferences**: If your app allows users to customize their notification preferences, this package can help manage those settings effectively.
- **Platform-Specific Features**: When you want to leverage platform-specific notification features, especially on Android, this package provides the necessary tools.

## Features
- **Channel Creation**: Easily create notification channels for Android.
- **Channel Management**: Update or delete existing channels as needed.
- **Customizable Settings**: Set channel importance, sound, vibration, and more.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: While primarily focused on Android, it integrates well with FCM for iOS.

Overall, `fcm_channels_manager` is an essential package for Flutter developers looking to enhance their notification handling capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using fcm_channels_manager

## Installation
To get started with `fcm_channels_manager`, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fcm_channels_manager: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/fcm_channels_manager).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Firebase Setup**: Ensure that your Flutter project is set up with Firebase. Follow the [official Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) for guidance.
2. **AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and services in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <!-- Add this line -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.firebase.messaging.default_notification_channel_id"
            android:value="your_default_channel_id" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

3. **Create Notification Channels**: Use the `fcm_channels_manager` to create channels in your application.

### iOS
1. **Firebase Setup**: Similar to Android, ensure Firebase is configured for your iOS app.
2. **AppDelegate.swift**: Make sure to request permission for notifications in your `AppDelegate.swift`:

```swift
import Firebase
import UserNotifications

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
    override func application(
        _ application: UIApplication,
        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        FirebaseApp.configure()
        
        // Request permission for notifications
        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .badge, .sound]) { granted, error in
            // Handle permission
        }
        
        return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
    }
}
```

## Using the Package
Once the setup is complete, you can start using the package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a notification channel and send a notification.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fcm_channels_manager/fcm_channels_manager.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'FCM Channels Manager Demo',
      home: NotificationHome(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NotificationHomeState createState() => _NotificationHomeState();
}

class _NotificationHomeState extends State<NotificationHome> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Create a notification channel
    FCMChannelsManager.createChannel(
      channelId: 'high_importance_channel',
      channelName: 'High Importance Notifications',
      channelDescription: 'This channel is used for high importance notifications.',
      importance: Importance.high,
    );
  }

  void _sendNotification() {
    // Send a notification using the created channel
    FCMChannelsManager.sendNotification(
      channelId: 'high_importance_channel',
      title: 'Hello!',
      body: 'This is a notification from the FCM Channels Manager.',
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('FCM Channels Manager Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _sendNotification,
          child: Text('Send Notification'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of fcm_channels_manager

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fcm_channels_manager/fcm_channels_manager.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'FCM Channels Manager Demo',
      home: NotificationHome(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NotificationHomeState createState() => _NotificationHomeState();
}

class _NotificationHomeState extends State<NotificationHome> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Create a notification channel with high importance
    FCMChannelsManager.createChannel(
      channelId: 'high_importance_channel', // Unique ID for the channel
      channelName: 'High Importance Notifications', // User-friendly name
      channelDescription: 'This channel is used for high importance notifications.', // Description of the channel
      importance: Importance.high, // Set the importance level
    );
  }

  void _sendNotification() {
    // Function to send a notification using the created channel
    FCMChannelsManager.sendNotification(
      channelId: 'high_importance_channel', // Use the same channel ID
      title: 'Hello!', // Title of the notification
      body: 'This is a notification from the FCM Channels Manager.', // Body text of the notification
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('FCM Channels Manager Demo'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _sendNotification, // Trigger notification on button press
          child: Text('Send Notification'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets NotificationHome as the home widget.
// 3. In NotificationHome, the initState method is called, where a notification channel is created.
// 4. The channel is configured with a unique ID, name, description, and importance level.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered button.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the _sendNotification method is called, which sends a notification using the created channel.
// 7. The notification appears in the notification tray, demonstrating the functionality of the fcm_channels_manager package.
