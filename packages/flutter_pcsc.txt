# Setup and Usage Tutorial for flutter_pcsc

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `flutter_pcsc` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_pcsc: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_pcsc).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.NFC" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

2. **NFC Support**: Ensure that your Android device supports NFC and that it is enabled.

### iOS Configuration

1. **NFC Capability**: Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSNFCUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires NFC access to communicate with smart cards.</string>
```

2. **Enable NFC**: Ensure that your iOS device supports NFC and that it is enabled.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the `flutter_pcsc` package in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the Package**:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_pcsc/flutter_pcsc.dart';
```

2. **Initialize the PC/SC**:

You can initialize the PC/SC service and listen for card events as follows:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Initialize the PC/SC service
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    FlutterPcsc.start();
    FlutterPcsc.onCardDetected.listen((card) {
      // Handle card detection
      print('Card detected: ${card.uid}');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Smart Card Reader')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Waiting for card...')),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the PC/SC service and listens for card detection events.

# Complete Example of flutter_pcsc

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pcsc/flutter_pcsc.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Smart Card Reader',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String cardInfo = 'No card detected';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start the PC/SC service
    FlutterPcsc.start();

    // Listen for card detection events
    FlutterPcsc.onCardDetected.listen((card) {
      // Update the UI with card information
      setState(() {
        cardInfo = 'Card detected: ${card.uid}';
      });
    });

    // Listen for card removal events
    FlutterPcsc.onCardRemoved.listen((_) {
      // Update the UI when the card is removed
      setState(() {
        cardInfo = 'No card detected';
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Smart Card Reader')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(cardInfo, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp and sets the HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. In the HomeScreen, the PC/SC service is started in the initState method.
// 4. The app listens for card detection events and updates the UI with the card's UID when detected.
// 5. If a card is removed, the app updates the UI to indicate that no card is detected.
// 6. The UI displays the current status of card detection in the center of the screen.
```
