# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Camera Roll Uploader

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `camera_roll_uploader` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the `camera_roll_uploader` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  camera_roll_uploader: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/camera_roll_uploader).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission to access the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save images.</string>
```

## Using the Package

To use the `camera_roll_uploader`, you will need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:camera_roll_uploader/camera_roll_uploader.dart';
```

You can then create a function to select and upload images:

```dart
Future<void> uploadImages() async {
  // Select images from the camera roll
  List<Media> selectedImages = await CameraRollUploader.getImages();

  // Upload each selected image
  for (var image in selectedImages) {
    await CameraRollUploader.upload(image.path);
  }
}
```

This function allows users to select images from their camera roll and upload them to a server.

# Complete Example: A Functional Flutter Application

Below is a complete Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `camera_roll_uploader` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:camera_roll_uploader/camera_roll_uploader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Camera Roll Uploader',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Upload Images'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Call the uploadImages function when the button is pressed
            await uploadImages();
          },
          child: Text('Select and Upload Images'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<void> uploadImages() async {
    // Select images from the camera roll
    List<Media> selectedImages = await CameraRollUploader.getImages();

    // Check if any images were selected
    if (selectedImages.isNotEmpty) {
      // Upload each selected image
      for (var image in selectedImages) {
        // Upload the image and handle the response
        var response = await CameraRollUploader.upload(image.path);
        // Handle the response (e.g., show a success message)
        print('Uploaded: ${image.path}, Response: $response');
      }
    } else {
      // Show a message if no images were selected
      print('No images selected.');
    }
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains an AppBar and a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the uploadImages function is called.
// 5. The uploadImages function uses the CameraRollUploader to select images from the camera roll.
// 6. If images are selected, it iterates through each image and uploads it using the upload method.
// 7. The response from the upload is printed to the console, allowing for further handling (e.g., success messages).
// 8. If no images are selected, a message is printed to indicate this.
```
