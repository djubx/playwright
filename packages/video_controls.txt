# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Video Controls Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `video_controls` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `video_controls` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_controls: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet and read external storage if you are loading videos from the web or local storage:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file to allow access to the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement video controls.

# Complete Example: Implementing Video Controls

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_controls/video_controls.dart'; // Import the video_controls package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Video Controls Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: VideoPlayerScreen(), // Set the home screen to VideoPlayerScreen
    );
  }
}

// VideoPlayerScreen widget
class VideoPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoPlayerScreenState createState() => _VideoPlayerScreenState();
}

class _VideoPlayerScreenState extends State<VideoPlayerScreen> {
  late VideoController _controller; // Declare a VideoController

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = VideoController.network(
      'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // Replace with your video URL
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose(); // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Controls Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Video player widget
            VideoPlayer(_controller),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between video and controls
            // Video controls widget
            VideoControls(
              controller: _controller, // Pass the controller to VideoControls
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that plays a video with custom controls.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app and sets `MyApp` as the root widget.
// 2. `MyApp` builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, setting `VideoPlayerScreen` as the home screen.
// 3. `VideoPlayerScreen` is a stateful widget that manages the video playback.
// 4. In `initState`, a `VideoController` is created with a network video URL.
// 5. The `dispose` method ensures the controller is properly disposed of when the widget is removed.
// 6. The `build` method constructs the UI, including the video player and controls.
// 7. The `VideoControls` widget is linked to the `VideoController`, allowing users to play, pause, and control the video.
