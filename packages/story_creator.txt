# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "story_creator" Package

## Installation
To get started with the `story_creator` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  story_creator: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package. After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, especially if you are using media features. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to create stories.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to capture photos for stories.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `story_creator` package, you can create a simple story interface. Below is a basic example of how to implement it in your Flutter app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:story_creator/story_creator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Story Creator Example',
      home: StoryCreatorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class StoryCreatorScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Create Your Story'),
      ),
      body: StoryCreator(
        onCreate: (stories) {
          // Handle the created stories
          print('Stories created: $stories');
        },
        onError: (error) {
          // Handle any errors
          print('Error: $error');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that utilizes the `story_creator` package to allow users to create stories. The `StoryCreator` widget handles the story creation process and provides callbacks for success and error handling.

# Complete Example of Using the "story_creator" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:story_creator/story_creator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Story Creator Example',
      home: StoryCreatorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class StoryCreatorScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Create Your Story'),
      ),
      body: StoryCreator(
        onCreate: (stories) {
          // This callback is triggered when stories are successfully created
          print('Stories created: $stories');
        },
        onError: (error) {
          // This callback is triggered if there is an error during story creation
          print('Error: $error');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets the home to StoryCreatorScreen.
// 3. StoryCreatorScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body that includes the StoryCreator widget.
// 4. The StoryCreator widget provides two callbacks: onCreate and onError.
// 5. When the user creates a story, the onCreate callback is triggered, printing the created stories to the console.
// 6. If an error occurs during story creation, the onError callback is triggered, printing the error message to the console.
