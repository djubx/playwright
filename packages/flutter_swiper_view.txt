# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_swiper_view`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `flutter_swiper_view` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_swiper_view: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a swiper view.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_swiper_view/flutter_swiper_view.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that uses the `Swiper` class to display a list of items:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Swiper View Example'),
      ),
      body: Swiper(
        itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
          return Image.network(
            'https://example.com/image$index.jpg',
            fit: BoxFit.fill,
          );
        },
        itemCount: 5, // Number of items to display
        pagination: SwiperPagination(), // Pagination indicators
        control: SwiperControl(), // Control buttons
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application to see the swiper in action!

# Complete Example of `flutter_swiper_view`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_swiper_view/flutter_swiper_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Swiper View Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Swiper View Example'),
      ),
      body: Swiper(
        itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
          // Building each item in the swiper
          return Image.network(
            'https://example.com/image$index.jpg', // Replace with your image URL
            fit: BoxFit.fill, // Ensures the image fills the space
          );
        },
        itemCount: 5, // Total number of items in the swiper
        pagination: SwiperPagination(), // Displays pagination indicators
        control: SwiperControl(), // Adds control buttons for navigation
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main screen.
// 4. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Swiper widget.
// 5. The Swiper widget uses itemBuilder to create each item dynamically based on the index.
// 6. Images are fetched from a network source and displayed in the swiper.
// 7. Pagination and control buttons are added for better navigation through the items.
```
