# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Number Slide Animation Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `number_slide_animation` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  number_slide_animation: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `NumberSlideAnimation` widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:number_slide_animation/number_slide_animation.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Number Slide Animation Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: NumberSlideAnimation(
            number: 12345, // The number to animate
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the animation
            curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Animation curve
            textStyle: TextStyle(
              fontSize: 48,
              fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a number with a slide animation. The `NumberSlideAnimation` widget takes in the number to animate, the duration of the animation, the animation curve, and the text style.

# Complete Example of Number Slide Animation

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:number_slide_animation/number_slide_animation.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _currentNumber = 0; // Variable to hold the current number

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Simulate a number change every 2 seconds
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), _updateNumber);
  }

  void _updateNumber() {
    setState(() {
      _currentNumber += 100; // Increment the number by 100
    });
    // Call this function again after 2 seconds
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), _updateNumber);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Number Slide Animation Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: NumberSlideAnimation(
            number: _currentNumber, // Pass the current number to animate
            duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Duration of the animation
            curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Animation curve
            textStyle: TextStyle(
              fontSize: 48,
              fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current number.
// 3. In the initState method, we set up a delayed function to update the number every 2 seconds.
// 4. The _updateNumber method increments the current number by 100 and calls setState to trigger a rebuild.
// 5. The NumberSlideAnimation widget animates the transition of the current number with a specified duration and curve.
// 6. The animation continues indefinitely, updating the number every 2 seconds, providing a smooth visual experience.
```
