# Quick Notify Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **quick_notify** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  quick_notify: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for notifications:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
<key>NSUserNotificationUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires notification permissions to alert you about important updates.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using Quick Notify

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display a notification:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:quick_notify/quick_notify.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Quick Notify Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Display a notification when the button is pressed
              QuickNotify.show(
                title: 'Hello!',
                message: 'This is a notification from Quick Notify.',
                duration: Duration(seconds: 3),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Notification'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a notification will appear at the top of the screen for 3 seconds.

# Complete Example of Quick Notify

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:quick_notify/quick_notify.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Quick Notify Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Display a notification when the button is pressed
              QuickNotify.show(
                title: 'Hello!',
                message: 'This is a notification from Quick Notify.',
                duration: Duration(seconds: 3), // Notification duration
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Notification'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

/*
  Application Flow Explanation:
  
  1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
  2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
  3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
  4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
  5. The QuickNotify.show() method is called to display a notification with a title and message.
  6. The notification appears at the top of the screen for the specified duration (3 seconds).
  7. After 3 seconds, the notification automatically disappears, enhancing user experience without interrupting their workflow.
