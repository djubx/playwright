# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Super Sliver List Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **super_sliver_list** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  super_sliver_list: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/super_sliver_list).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:super_sliver_list/super_sliver_list.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Super Sliver List

You can now use the **SuperSliverList** widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
SuperSliverList(
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return ListTile(
      title: Text('Item $index'),
    );
  },
  itemCount: 100,
);
```

This code creates a sliver list with 100 items, each displaying its index.

## Conclusion

The **super_sliver_list** package is a powerful tool for creating efficient and customizable scrollable lists in Flutter. By following the steps above, you can easily integrate it into your application and start building high-performance lists.

# Complete Example of Using the Super Sliver List

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:super_sliver_list/super_sliver_list.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Super Sliver List Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Super Sliver List Example'),
        ),
        body: CustomScrollView(
          slivers: <Widget>[
            SliverToBoxAdapter(
              child: Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                child: Text(
                  'Welcome to the Super Sliver List Example!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            // Using SuperSliverList to display a list of items
            SuperSliverList(
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text('Item $index'),
                );
              },
              itemCount: 100, // Total number of items in the list
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Super Sliver List Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a CustomScrollView, which allows for slivers.
// 5. A SliverToBoxAdapter is used to display a welcome message at the top of the list.
// 6. The SuperSliverList widget is then used to create a scrollable list of 100 items.
// 7. Each item in the list is represented by a ListTile displaying its index.
