Here's a detailed technical blog on the "duck_router" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Duck Router Flutter Package

The **duck_router** package is a powerful routing solution for Flutter applications that simplifies navigation and enhances the overall user experience. It provides a declarative way to define routes, making it easier to manage complex navigation scenarios in your app.

## When to Use Duck Router

You should consider using the **duck_router** package when:
- You have a complex navigation structure with multiple routes and nested navigators.
- You want to improve the readability and maintainability of your routing code.
- You need to pass data between routes easily and efficiently.

## Key Features
- **Declarative Routing**: Define routes in a clear and concise manner.
- **Named Routes**: Easily navigate using named routes, which improves code readability.
- **Parameter Passing**: Pass parameters between routes seamlessly.
- **Nested Navigation**: Support for nested navigators, allowing for more complex UI structures.

Overall, the **duck_router** package is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to streamline their navigation logic and improve the user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Duck Router

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **duck_router** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **duck_router** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  duck_router: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/duck_router).

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart files where you want to use the router, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:duck_router/duck_router.dart';
```

## Step 3: Configure for Android and iOS

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations. Typically, no special configurations are needed for routing, but ensure your app's theme and other settings are correctly set.

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your `Info.plist` file is configured correctly. Again, routing does not require special configurations, but you should ensure that your app's settings are in place.

## Step 4: Define Routes

You can define your routes using the `DuckRouter` class. Hereâ€™s an example of how to set up your routes:

```dart
final router = DuckRouter(
  routes: {
    '/': (context) => HomeScreen(),
    '/details': (context) => DetailsScreen(),
  },
);
```

## Step 5: Use the Router in Your App

Wrap your `MaterialApp` with the `DuckRouter` widget:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    DuckRouter(
      router: router,
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

Now you can navigate between screens using the defined routes.

## Step 6: Navigating Between Routes

To navigate to a new route, use the `navigateTo` method:

```dart
DuckRouter.of(context).navigateTo('/details');
```

You can also pass parameters:

```dart
DuckRouter.of(context).navigateTo('/details', arguments: {'id': 1});
```

This will allow you to access the parameters in the `DetailsScreen`.

With these steps, you have successfully set up and configured the **duck_router** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Duck Router

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:duck_router/duck_router.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(
    DuckRouter(
      router: router,
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}

// Define the routes for the application
final router = DuckRouter(
  routes: {
    '/': (context) => HomeScreen(), // Home screen route
    '/details': (context) => DetailsScreen(), // Details screen route
  },
);

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Duck Router Example',
      home: HomeScreen(), // Set the home screen
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the details screen when the button is pressed
            DuckRouter.of(context).navigateTo('/details', arguments: {'id': 1});
          },
          child: Text('Go to Details'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Details screen widget
class DetailsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Retrieve the arguments passed from the previous screen
    final args = DuckRouter.of(context).getArguments();
    final id = args['id']; // Extract the 'id' parameter

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Details Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Details for item ID: $id'), // Display the item ID
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which initializes the DuckRouter.
// 2. The router defines two routes: the home screen and the details screen.
// 3. The MyApp widget sets the home screen as the initial screen.
// 4. The HomeScreen widget contains a button that, when pressed, navigates to the DetailsScreen.
// 5. The DetailsScreen retrieves the passed arguments and displays the item ID on the screen.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we have created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the **duck_router** package. The application consists of a home screen with a button that navigates to a details screen, passing an ID as an argument. The comments within the code explain the flow of the application step-by-step, making it easy to understand how the routing works.

### Final Summary
The application starts with the `main` function, initializing the `DuckRouter` with defined routes. The `MyApp` widget sets the home screen, which contains a button to navigate to the details screen. When the button is pressed, the app navigates to the `DetailsScreen`, passing an ID as an argument. The `DetailsScreen` retrieves this argument and displays it, demonstrating the seamless navigation and parameter passing capabilities of the **duck_router** package.
