              // Display a star icon
              HeroIcon(

            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a Material Design scaffold.
// 2. The scaffold contains an app bar with a title, and a body with a centered column.
// 3. The column contains three HeroIcon widgets, each displaying a different icon (bell, heart, and star).
// 4. The icons are displayed in a row, with a size of 24 pixels and a color that matches the theme.
// 5. The user can interact with the icons, but there is no specific functionality implemented in this demo.
// Overall, this demo showcases the basic usage of the Heroicons Flutter package and how to display icons in a Flutter app.
