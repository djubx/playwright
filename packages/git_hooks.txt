Here's a detailed technical blog on the "git_hooks" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Git Hooks Flutter Package

The `git_hooks` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to integrate Git hooks into their Flutter applications. Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commits, pushes, and receives. This package provides a way to automate tasks and enforce policies in your Flutter projects, enhancing your development workflow.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `git_hooks` package in scenarios such as:

- **Pre-commit Checks**: Automatically run tests or linters before allowing a commit.
- **Post-commit Actions**: Trigger notifications or deploy scripts after a successful commit.
- **Enforcing Code Standards**: Ensure that code adheres to specific standards before it is pushed to the repository.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Customizable Hooks**: Easily define and customize hooks for various Git events.
- **Integration with Flutter**: Leverage Flutter's capabilities to create a smooth development experience.

By using the `git_hooks` package, you can streamline your development process, reduce errors, and maintain code quality.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Git Hooks Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `git_hooks` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  git_hooks: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Configuring Git Hooks

### For Android

1. Navigate to your Android project directory:
   ```bash
   cd android
   ```

2. Create a directory for your hooks if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .git/hooks
   ```

3. Create a hook script (e.g., `pre-commit`) and make it executable:
   ```bash
   touch .git/hooks/pre-commit
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

4. Add your desired commands to the `pre-commit` script. For example:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh
   flutter test
   ```

### For iOS

1. Navigate to your iOS project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ios
   ```

2. Similar to Android, create a hooks directory if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .git/hooks
   ```

3. Create a hook script (e.g., `pre-push`) and make it executable:
   ```bash
   touch .git/hooks/pre-push
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
   ```

4. Add your desired commands to the `pre-push` script. For example:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh
   flutter analyze
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up your hooks, you can use the `git_hooks` package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to implement it in your main application file.

# Complete Example of Using Git Hooks in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:git_hooks/git_hooks.dart'; // Import the git_hooks package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Git Hooks Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Git Hooks in Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger a Git commit action
              GitHooks.commit('Your commit message here');
            },
            child: Text('Commit Changes'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers a Git commit action using the GitHooks.commit() method.
// 5. The commit message can be customized as needed, allowing for easy integration of Git hooks into the development workflow.
