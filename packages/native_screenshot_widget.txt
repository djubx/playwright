# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Native Screenshot Widget

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `native_screenshot_widget` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  native_screenshot_widget: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/native_screenshot_widget).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for saving images:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save screenshots.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save screenshots.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to capture a screenshot of a widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_screenshot_widget/native_screenshot_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Screenshot Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ScreenshotWidget(
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Text('Capture this widget!'),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () async {
                    // Capture the screenshot
                    final image = await ScreenshotWidget.capture();
                    // Save or share the image as needed
                  },
                  child: Text('Capture Screenshot'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that captures a screenshot of the widget when pressed.

# Complete Example of Native Screenshot Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_screenshot_widget/native_screenshot_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Screenshot Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ScreenshotWidget(
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                // Displaying a text widget to capture
                Text('Capture this widget!'),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () async {
                    // Capture the screenshot of the widget
                    final image = await ScreenshotWidget.capture();
                    // Here you can save or share the image
                    // For demonstration, we will just show a snackbar
                    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                      SnackBar(content: Text('Screenshot captured!')),
                    );
                  },
                  child: Text('Capture Screenshot'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds the main MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the Scaffold, we have an AppBar and a Center widget that contains our ScreenshotWidget.
// 3. The ScreenshotWidget wraps a Column containing a Text widget and an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. Inside the callback, we call ScreenshotWidget.capture() to take a screenshot of the widget.
// 6. After capturing the screenshot, we display a Snackbar to inform the user that the screenshot has been captured.
// 7. This simple flow allows users to capture and handle screenshots easily.
