# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Circular Gradient Spinner

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **circular_gradient_spinner** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  circular_gradient_spinner: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the spinner, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:circular_gradient_spinner/circular_gradient_spinner.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Spinner

You can now use the `CircularGradientSpinner` widget in your application. Below is an example of how to implement it in a simple Flutter app.

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
  
  ```gradle
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

## Step 5: Customizing the Spinner

You can customize the spinner by adjusting its properties such as size, gradient colors, and animation speed. Here’s a basic example:

```dart
CircularGradientSpinner(
  size: 100.0,
  gradientColors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
  duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
)
```

This will create a spinner of size 100 with a gradient transitioning from blue to purple over 2 seconds.

# Complete Example of Circular Gradient Spinner

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:circular_gradient_spinner/circular_gradient_spinner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Circular Gradient Spinner Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Circular Gradient Spinner'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: LoadingSpinner(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class LoadingSpinner extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CircularGradientSpinner(
      size: 100.0, // Set the size of the spinner
      gradientColors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple], // Define gradient colors
      duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Set the duration of the animation
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Circular Gradient Spinner".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers the LoadingSpinner widget.
// 5. LoadingSpinner is another StatelessWidget that builds the CircularGradientSpinner.
// 6. The spinner is configured with a size of 100, a gradient from blue to purple, and a 2-second animation duration.
// 7. When the app runs, the spinner will display in the center of the screen, animating continuously.
