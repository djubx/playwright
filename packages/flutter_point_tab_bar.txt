# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_point_tab_bar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_point_tab_bar` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_point_tab_bar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_point_tab_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the tab bar, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_point_tab_bar/flutter_point_tab_bar.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Tab Bar

Now, let's create a simple application that uses the `flutter_point_tab_bar`. Below is a basic example of how to implement it.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_point_tab_bar/flutter_point_tab_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Point Tab Bar Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Current index of the selected tab
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  // List of widgets to display for each tab
  final List<Widget> _children = [
    Center(child: Text('Home Tab')),
    Center(child: Text('Search Tab')),
    Center(child: Text('Profile Tab')),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Point Tab Bar Example'),
      ),
      body: _children[_currentIndex], // Display the selected tab's content
      bottomNavigationBar: PointTabBar(
        // Define the tabs
        tabs: [
          Tab(text: 'Home'),
          Tab(text: 'Search'),
          Tab(text: 'Profile'),
        ],
        // Set the current index
        currentIndex: _currentIndex,
        // Callback for when a tab is tapped
        onTap: (index) {
          setState(() {
            _currentIndex = index; // Update the current index
          });
        },
        // Customize the appearance of the tab bar
        indicatorColor: Colors.blue,
        labelColor: Colors.black,
        unselectedLabelColor: Colors.grey,
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. HomeScreen is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected tab.
// 4. The _currentIndex variable keeps track of which tab is currently selected.
// 5. The _children list contains the content for each tab.
// 6. The PointTabBar widget is used to create the tab bar at the bottom of the screen.
// 7. When a tab is tapped, the onTap callback updates the _currentIndex, causing the UI to rebuild and display the corresponding content.
```
