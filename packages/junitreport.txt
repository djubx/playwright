# JUnitReport Flutter Package

The `junitreport` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for the generation of JUnit-style test reports. This package is particularly useful for teams that want to integrate their Flutter testing with CI/CD pipelines, as JUnit reports are widely supported by various CI tools and can be easily parsed by many testing frameworks.

## When to Use

You should consider using the `junitreport` package when:
- You are working on a Flutter project that requires automated testing.
- You want to generate reports that can be easily integrated with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or CircleCI.
- You need a standardized format for your test results that can be shared across different teams or tools.

## Features

- **JUnit XML Report Generation**: Automatically generates JUnit-compatible XML reports from your Flutter test results.
- **Customizable Output**: Allows customization of the report output, including test names, durations, and results.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Seamlessly integrates with CI/CD pipelines, making it easier to track test results over time.
- **Support for Multiple Platforms**: Works on both Android and iOS, ensuring that your test reports are consistent across platforms.

By leveraging the `junitreport` package, you can enhance your testing workflow and ensure that your Flutter applications maintain high quality through rigorous testing.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the JUnitReport Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `junitreport` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `junitreport` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  junitreport: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Configuring for Android

For Android, you may need to ensure that your `build.gradle` file is set up correctly. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and make sure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    testOptions {
        unitTests.all {
            useJUnitPlatform()
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration ensures that your unit tests are compatible with JUnit.

## Step 3: Configuring for iOS

For iOS, ensure that your project is set up to run tests. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and check that your test targets are configured correctly.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your test files. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to generate a JUnit report in your test:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:junitreport/junitreport.dart';

void main() {
  group('Sample Tests', () {
    test('Test 1', () {
      expect(1 + 1, equals(2));
    });

    test('Test 2', () {
      expect(2 * 2, equals(4));
    });
  });

  // Generate the JUnit report
  JUnitReport.generate();
}
```

In this example, we define a group of tests and then call `JUnitReport.generate()` to create the report after the tests have run.

## Step 5: Running Tests

To run your tests and generate the report, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter test --reporter=junit
```

This command will execute your tests and generate a JUnit report in the specified output directory.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the `junitreport` package into your Flutter project and start generating JUnit-style test reports.

# Complete Example of Using the JUnitReport Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:junitreport/junitreport.dart';

void main() {
  // This is the main entry point of the Flutter application.
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'JUnit Report Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('JUnit Report Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Running tests with JUnit report generation!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Test cases for the application
void testApp() {
  group('RealFlutter Tests', () {
    testWidgets('Initial test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
      // Build our app and trigger a frame.
      await tester.pumpWidget(RealFlutter());

      // Verify that our app displays the correct title.
      expect(find.text('JUnit Report Example'), findsOneWidget);
      expect(find.text('Running tests with JUnit report generation!'), findsOneWidget);
    });
  });

  // Generate the JUnit report after tests
  JUnitReport.generate();
}

// Run the tests
void runTests() {
  testApp();
}

// Call the runTests function to execute the tests
runTests();
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, where we call runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a simple UI.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, we have an AppBar and a Center widget displaying a message.
// 4. The testApp function contains a group of widget tests for the RealFlutter application.
// 5. We use the testWidgets function to create a test that builds the app and checks for the presence of specific text.
// 6. After the tests are executed, we call JUnitReport.generate() to create the JUnit report.
// 7. Finally, the runTests function is called to execute the tests when the application runs.
```
