# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using m3_carousel

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `m3_carousel` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  m3_carousel: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:m3_carousel/m3_carousel.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Carousel

You can now use the `M3Carousel` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
M3Carousel(
  items: [
    Image.network('https://example.com/image1.jpg'),
    Image.network('https://example.com/image2.jpg'),
    Image.network('https://example.com/image3.jpg'),
  ],
  options: CarouselOptions(
    autoPlay: true,
    height: 200,
    enlargeCenterPage: true,
  ),
)
```

This code snippet creates a carousel that automatically plays through three images.

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'M3 Carousel Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('M3 Carousel Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: M3Carousel(
            items: [
              // Adding images to the carousel
              Image.network('https://example.com/image1.jpg'),
              Image.network('https://example.com/image2.jpg'),
              Image.network('https://example.com/image3.jpg'),
            ],
            options: CarouselOptions(
              autoPlay: true, // Enables automatic scrolling
              height: 200, // Sets the height of the carousel
              enlargeCenterPage: true, // Enlarges the center item
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, the M3Carousel is instantiated with a list of images.
// 5. The CarouselOptions are set to enable auto-play, define the height, and enlarge the center page.
// 6. The carousel displays the images, allowing users to swipe through them or watch them auto-scroll.
