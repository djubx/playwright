# Tutorial: Setting Up youtube_player_flutter_quill

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `youtube_player_flutter_quill` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `youtube_player_flutter_quill` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  youtube_player_flutter_quill: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/youtube_player_flutter_quill).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key to allow network access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:youtube_player_flutter_quill/youtube_player_flutter_quill.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

You can now use the `YoutubePlayer` widget in your application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
YoutubePlayer(
  controller: YoutubePlayerController(
    initialVideoId: 'dQw4w9WgXcQ', // Replace with your video ID
    flags: YoutubePlayerFlags(
      autoPlay: false,
      mute: false,
    ),
  ),
  showVideoProgressIndicator: true,
)
```

This code snippet creates a YouTube player that does not autoplay and is not muted by default.

# Complete Example of youtube_player_flutter_quill

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application using the `youtube_player_flutter_quill` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:youtube_player_flutter_quill/youtube_player_flutter_quill.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'YouTube Player Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late YoutubePlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the YoutubePlayerController with a video ID
    _controller = YoutubePlayerController(
      initialVideoId: 'dQw4w9WgXcQ', // Replace with your video ID
      flags: YoutubePlayerFlags(
        autoPlay: false, // Video will not autoplay
        mute: false, // Video will not be muted
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is disposed
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('YouTube Player Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the YoutubePlayer widget
          YoutubePlayer(
            controller: _controller,
            showVideoProgressIndicator: true, // Show progress indicator
            onReady: () {
              // Callback when the player is ready
              print('Player is ready.');
            },
          ),
          // Additional UI elements can be added here
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages the YoutubePlayerController.
// 4. In initState, the controller is initialized with a video ID and flags.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a YoutubePlayer widget.
// 6. The YoutubePlayer widget displays the video and allows user interaction.
// 7. When the widget is disposed, the controller is also disposed to free resources.
```
