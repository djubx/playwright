# Tutorial: Using the Custom Accordion Package
=============================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To use the `custom_accordion` package, you need to add it to your project. You can do this by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  custom_accordion: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

To use the `custom_accordion` package, you need to import it into your Dart file. You can do this by adding the following line at the top of your file:
```dart
import 'package:custom_accordion/custom_accordion.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create an Accordion Widget

To create an accordion widget, you can use the `CustomAccordion` class. Here is an example:
```dart
CustomAccordion(
  title: 'Accordion Title',
  content: 'Accordion content',
)
```
This will create a basic accordion widget with a title and content.

### Step 4: Customize the Accordion Widget

You can customize the accordion widget by using the various properties available. For example, you can change the style of the title and content using the `titleStyle` and `contentStyle` properties:
```dart
CustomAccordion(
  title: 'Accordion Title',
  content: 'Accordion content',
  titleStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
  contentStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
)
```
You can also add animation to the accordion widget using the `animationDuration` property:
```dart
CustomAccordion(
  title: 'Accordion Title',
  content: 'Accordion content',
  animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
)
```
### Platform-Specific Details

The `custom_accordion` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details to keep in mind:

* On Android, the accordion widget will use the default Android animation for expanding and collapsing content.
* On iOS, the accordion widget will use a custom animation for expanding and collapsing content.

### Required Configurations or Optimizations

There are no required configurations or optimizations for using the `custom_accordion` package. However, you may want to consider the following:

* Make sure to test the accordion widget on different devices and platforms to ensure that it works as expected.
* Consider adding a delay to the animation to make it more smooth and natural.

// This is the main file for the demo app.
// It creates a Material app with a home page that displays two accordion widgets.
// Each accordion widget has a title and content, and can be expanded and collapsed using the animation.

// The first accordion widget has a title style with a font size of 24, and a content style with a font size of 18.
// The second accordion widget has the same styles as the first one.

// The animation duration for both accordion widgets is set to 500 milliseconds.

// The app uses the CustomAccordion class from the custom_accordion package to create the accordion widgets.

// The CustomAccordion class takes several properties, including title, content, titleStyle, contentStyle, and animationDuration.

// The title and content properties are used to set the text for the accordion title and content.

// The titleStyle and contentStyle properties are used to set the styles for the accordion title and content.

// The animationDuration property is used to set the duration of the animation for expanding and collapsing the accordion content.

// The app uses the MaterialApp and Scaffold classes from the Flutter framework to create the app and its home page.

// The home page is created using the MyHomePage class, which is a stateful widget.

// The MyHomePage class creates a column with two accordion widgets, separated by a SizedBox with a height of 20.

// The app uses the Center class to center the column horizontally and vertically.

// The app uses the Theme class to set the primary swatch color to blue.

// The app uses the runApp function to run the app.
