# Exploring the Playify Flutter Package

The **Playify** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to integrate audio playback capabilities into their applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage audio files, whether they are local assets or streamed from the internet. Playify is particularly useful for applications that require background audio playback, such as music players, podcasts, or any app that needs to handle audio content seamlessly.

## When to Use Playify
- **Music Applications**: If you're building a music player app, Playify can help you manage playlists and audio controls.
- **Podcast Apps**: For apps that stream or play podcast episodes, Playify offers the necessary features to handle audio playback.
- **Games**: If your game requires background music or sound effects, Playify can manage audio playback efficiently.

## Key Features
- **Simple API**: Playify provides an easy-to-use API for audio playback.
- **Background Playback**: Supports audio playback even when the app is in the background.
- **Audio Controls**: Offers controls for play, pause, stop, and seek functionalities.
- **Stream and Local Support**: Can handle both local audio files and streaming audio from the internet.
- **Event Listeners**: Provides event listeners for tracking playback state changes.

# Setting Up and Using Playify

## Installation
To get started with Playify, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  playify: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/playify).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio playback.</string>
<key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your music library.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using Playify in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and control audio playback.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:playify/playify.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late Playify _playify;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _playify = Playify();
  }

  void _playAudio() {
    _playify.play('https://example.com/audio.mp3'); // Play audio from URL
  }

  void _pauseAudio() {
    _playify.pause(); // Pause audio playback
  }

  void _stopAudio() {
    _playify.stop(); // Stop audio playback
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Playify Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: _playAudio, child: Text('Play')),
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: _pauseAudio, child: Text('Pause')),
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: _stopAudio, child: Text('Stop')),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the Playify instance and provides buttons to control audio playback.

# Complete Example of Playify in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:playify/playify.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late Playify _playify; // Declare Playify instance
  bool _isPlaying = false; // Track playback state

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _playify = Playify(); // Initialize Playify
  }

  // Function to play audio
  void _playAudio() {
    _playify.play('https://example.com/audio.mp3'); // Play audio from URL
    setState(() {
      _isPlaying = true; // Update playback state
    });
  }

  // Function to pause audio
  void _pauseAudio() {
    _playify.pause(); // Pause audio playback
    setState(() {
      _isPlaying = false; // Update playback state
    });
  }

  // Function to stop audio
  void _stopAudio() {
    _playify.stop(); // Stop audio playback
    setState(() {
      _isPlaying = false; // Update playback state
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Playify Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Play button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _isPlaying ? null : _playAudio, // Disable if already playing
              child: Text('Play'),
            ),
            // Pause button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _isPlaying ? _pauseAudio : null, // Disable if not playing
              child: Text('Pause'),
            ),
            // Stop button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _isPlaying ? _stopAudio : null, // Disable if not playing
              child: Text('Stop'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The application starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// In the initState method, we initialize the Playify instance.
// The _playAudio method plays audio from a specified URL and updates the playback state.
// The _pauseAudio method pauses the audio and updates the state accordingly.
// The _stopAudio method stops the audio playback and updates the state.
// The build method creates a simple UI with three buttons: Play, Pause, and Stop.
// Each button is enabled or disabled based on the current playback state to prevent errors.
