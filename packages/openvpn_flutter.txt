# Setting Up and Using the OpenVPN Flutter Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `openvpn_flutter` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `openvpn_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  openvpn_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/openvpn_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Info.plist**: Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following keys to request permission for network access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Capabilities**: Ensure that your app has the necessary capabilities enabled for network access.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

### Basic Usage Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:openvpn_flutter/openvpn_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _status = "Disconnected";

  void _connectVPN() async {
    // Create a configuration for the VPN connection
    final config = OpenVPNConfig(
      config: "path/to/your/config.ovpn", // Path to your .ovpn file
      username: "your_username",
      password: "your_password",
    );

    // Attempt to connect to the VPN
    final result = await OpenVPNFlutter.connect(config);
    setState(() {
      _status = result ? "Connected" : "Connection Failed";
    });
  }

  void _disconnectVPN() async {
    // Disconnect from the VPN
    await OpenVPNFlutter.disconnect();
    setState(() {
      _status = "Disconnected";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("OpenVPN Flutter Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text("VPN Status: $_status"),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _connectVPN,
              child: Text("Connect VPN"),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _disconnectVPN,
              child: Text("Disconnect VPN"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of OpenVPN Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:openvpn_flutter/openvpn_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _status = "Disconnected"; // Variable to hold the VPN connection status

  void _connectVPN() async {
    // Create a configuration for the VPN connection
    final config = OpenVPNConfig(
      config: "path/to/your/config.ovpn", // Path to your .ovpn file
      username: "your_username", // Your VPN username
      password: "your_password", // Your VPN password
    );

    // Attempt to connect to the VPN
    final result = await OpenVPNFlutter.connect(config);
    setState(() {
      _status = result ? "Connected" : "Connection Failed"; // Update status based on connection result
    });
  }

  void _disconnectVPN() async {
    // Disconnect from the VPN
    await OpenVPNFlutter.disconnect();
    setState(() {
      _status = "Disconnected"; // Update status to disconnected
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("OpenVPN Flutter Example")), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text("VPN Status: $_status"), // Display current VPN status
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between elements
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _connectVPN, // Connect button
              child: Text("Connect VPN"),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _disconnectVPN, // Disconnect button
              child: Text("Disconnect VPN"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. The _RealFlutterState class manages the state of the VPN connection.
// 3. The _status variable holds the current connection status, initialized to "Disconnected".
// 4. The _connectVPN method creates an OpenVPNConfig object with the necessary credentials and attempts to connect to the VPN.
// 5. If the connection is successful, the status is updated to "Connected"; otherwise, it shows "Connection Failed".
// 6. The _disconnectVPN method disconnects from the VPN and updates the status to "Disconnected".
// 7. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the current VPN status and providing buttons to connect and disconnect from the VPN.
