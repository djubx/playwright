// This code creates a simple Flutter app that demonstrates the use of the Social Media Audio Recorder package.
// The app has two buttons: one to start and stop recording audio, and another to share the recorded audio file.
// When the user presses the "Start Recording" button, the app starts recording audio using the `startRecording` method.
// When the user presses the "Stop Recording" button, the app stops recording audio using the `stopRecording` method.
// When the user presses the "Share Audio" button, the app shares the recorded audio file using the `shareAudio` method.

// The app uses the `SocialMediaAudioRecorder` class to interact with the audio recorder, and the `init` method to initialize the recorder.
// The app also uses the `setState` method to update the UI when the recording state changes.

// Overall, this code provides a basic example of how to use the Social Media Audio Recorder package in a Flutter app.
