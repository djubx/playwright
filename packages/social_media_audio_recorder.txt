# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `social_media_audio_recorder`

## Installation
To get started with the `social_media_audio_recorder` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  social_media_audio_recorder: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/social_media_audio_recorder).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to record audio.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save recordings.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured the necessary permissions, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement audio recording functionality.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:social_media_audio_recorder/social_media_audio_recorder.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool isRecording = false;

  void startRecording() async {
    await SocialMediaAudioRecorder.startRecording();
    setState(() {
      isRecording = true;
    });
  }

  void stopRecording() async {
    await SocialMediaAudioRecorder.stopRecording();
    setState(() {
      isRecording = false;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Audio Recorder')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(isRecording ? 'Recording...' : 'Press the button to record'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: isRecording ? stopRecording : startRecording,
              child: Text(isRecording ? 'Stop Recording' : 'Start Recording'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple UI with a button to start and stop audio recording. The state of the recording is managed using a boolean variable `isRecording`.

# Complete Example of `social_media_audio_recorder`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:social_media_audio_recorder/social_media_audio_recorder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool isRecording = false; // State variable to track recording status

  // Function to start recording audio
  void startRecording() async {
    await SocialMediaAudioRecorder.startRecording(); // Start the recording
    setState(() {
      isRecording = true; // Update the state to indicate recording has started
    });
  }

  // Function to stop recording audio
  void stopRecording() async {
    await SocialMediaAudioRecorder.stopRecording(); // Stop the recording
    setState(() {
      isRecording = false; // Update the state to indicate recording has stopped
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Audio Recorder')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Center the column
          children: [
            // Display recording status
            Text(isRecording ? 'Recording...' : 'Press the button to record'),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between text and button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: isRecording ? stopRecording : startRecording, // Toggle recording
              child: Text(isRecording ? 'Stop Recording' : 'Start Recording'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that manages the recording state.
// The `startRecording` function initiates the audio recording and updates the UI.
// The `stopRecording` function stops the audio recording and updates the UI.
// The UI consists of a text widget that indicates whether the app is currently recording,
// and a button that toggles between starting and stopping the recording.
// When the button is pressed, it calls the appropriate function based on the current recording state.
// The app provides a simple interface for users to record audio clips easily.
