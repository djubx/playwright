# Delayed Display Flutter Package: An Overview

The `delayed_display` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to enhance the user interface of your Flutter applications by introducing animations with a delay. This package is particularly useful when you want to create engaging and dynamic UI elements that appear with a delay, adding a layer of sophistication to your app's design.

## When to Use Delayed Display

- **Onboarding Screens**: Gradually introduce elements to guide users through the onboarding process.
- **Splash Screens**: Create a more engaging splash screen by animating elements with a delay.
- **Content Reveal**: Use delayed animations to reveal content in a more visually appealing manner.

## Features

- **Customizable Delay**: Set the delay duration for each widget.
- **Flexible Animation**: Choose from a variety of animation curves to suit your design needs.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple integration with existing Flutter widgets.

The `delayed_display` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to add a touch of animation to their applications without the complexity of custom animation code.

# Setting Up and Using the Delayed Display Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `delayed_display` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `delayed_display` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     delayed_display: ^3.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Import the Package**: Import `delayed_display` in your Dart file where you plan to use it.

   ```dart
   import 'package:delayed_display/delayed_display.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

No additional configuration is required for Android. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 16 in the `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS

Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in the `ios/Podfile`.

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Using Delayed Display

To use the `delayed_display` package, wrap any widget with `DelayedDisplay` and configure the delay and animation properties.

```dart
DelayedDisplay(
  delay: Duration(seconds: 1),
  fadingDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  slidingBeginOffset: const Offset(0.0, 0.5),
  child: Text('Hello, Flutter!'),
)
```

This example will display the text "Hello, Flutter!" with a delay of one second, fading in over half a second, and sliding in from the bottom.

<-- MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:delayed_display/delayed_display.dart';

void main() => runApp(RealFlutter());

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Delayed Display Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Delayed Display Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // DelayedDisplay widget wraps the Text widget
              DelayedDisplay(
                delay: Duration(seconds: 1), // Delay before the widget appears
                fadingDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Duration of the fade-in effect
                slidingBeginOffset: const Offset(0.0, 0.5), // Start position for the sliding animation
                child: Text(
                  'Welcome to RealFlutter!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              DelayedDisplay(
                delay: Duration(seconds: 2), // Longer delay for the second widget
                fadingDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
                slidingBeginOffset: const Offset(0.0, -0.5), // Slide in from the top
                child: ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {},
                  child: Text('Get Started'),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter as the root widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a simple Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget to center its children.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to stack two children vertically.
// 5. Each child is wrapped in a DelayedDisplay widget to apply the delay and animation effects.
// 6. The first DelayedDisplay shows a Text widget with a 1-second delay, fading in and sliding up.
// 7. The second DelayedDisplay shows an ElevatedButton with a 2-second delay, fading in and sliding down.
// 8. The animations create a dynamic and engaging user interface experience.
