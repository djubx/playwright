# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Pencil Field Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **pencil_field** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pencil_field: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to save drawings to the device:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the photo library to save drawings.</string>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:pencil_field/pencil_field.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Pencil Field Widget
You can now use the `PencilField` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
PencilField(
  onDraw: (List<Offset> points) {
    // Handle the drawing points
  },
  brushColor: Colors.black,
  brushSize: 5.0,
  eraserMode: false,
)
```

This widget allows you to customize the drawing experience by setting the brush color and size, and toggling the eraser mode.

With these steps, you can successfully integrate the **pencil_field** package into your Flutter application and start creating interactive drawing features.

# Complete Example of Using the Pencil Field Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pencil_field/pencil_field.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pencil Field Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DrawingPage(),
    );
  }
}

class DrawingPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DrawingPageState createState() => _DrawingPageState();
}

class _DrawingPageState extends State<DrawingPage> {
  // Variable to hold the brush color
  Color brushColor = Colors.black;
  // Variable to hold the brush size
  double brushSize = 5.0;
  // Variable to toggle eraser mode
  bool eraserMode = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pencil Field Example'),
        actions: [
          // Button to toggle eraser mode
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(eraserMode ? Icons.brush : Icons.delete),
            onPressed: () {
              setState(() {
                eraserMode = !eraserMode; // Toggle eraser mode
              });
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // PencilField widget for drawing
          Expanded(
            child: PencilField(
              onDraw: (List<Offset> points) {
                // Handle the drawing points
              },
              brushColor: eraserMode ? Colors.white : brushColor, // Use white for eraser
              brushSize: brushSize,
              eraserMode: eraserMode,
            ),
          ),
          // Slider to adjust brush size
          Slider(
            value: brushSize,
            min: 1.0,
            max: 20.0,
            onChanged: (value) {
              setState(() {
                brushSize = value; // Update brush size
              });
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to DrawingPage, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In DrawingPage, we define variables for brush color, size, and eraser mode.
// 5. The AppBar contains a button to toggle eraser mode.
// 6. The body consists of a PencilField for drawing and a Slider to adjust the brush size.
// 7. The PencilField widget handles the drawing logic, using the current brush settings.
// 8. The Slider allows users to change the brush size dynamically.
// 9. The app updates the UI based on user interactions, providing a smooth drawing experience.
