# Setting Up and Using the `flutter_sms` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_sms` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_sms` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_sms: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, you need to add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to request permission to send SMS. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to contacts to send SMS.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the photo library to send SMS.</string>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to send an SMS.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sms/flutter_sms.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter SMS Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              _sendSMS("Hello from Flutter!", ["1234567890"]);
            },
            child: Text('Send SMS'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _sendSMS(String message, List<String> recipients) async {
    String result = await sendSMS(message: message, recipients: recipients)
        .catchError((onError) {
      print(onError);
    });
    print(result);
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that sends an SMS when pressed. The `_sendSMS` function is responsible for sending the SMS message.

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_sms`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sms/flutter_sms.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter SMS Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // When the button is pressed, call the _sendSMS function
              _sendSMS("Hello from Flutter!", ["1234567890"]);
            },
            child: Text('Send SMS'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to send SMS
  void _sendSMS(String message, List<String> recipients) async {
    // Attempt to send the SMS and handle any errors
    String result = await sendSMS(message: message, recipients: recipients)
        .catchError((onError) {
      print(onError); // Print any errors to the console
    });
    print(result); // Print the result of the SMS sending operation
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _sendSMS function is called with a message and a list of recipients.
// 5. The _sendSMS function uses the sendSMS method from the flutter_sms package to send the SMS.
// 6. If the SMS is sent successfully, the result is printed; if there is an error, it is caught and printed to the console.
