# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Link Preview

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **simple_link_preview** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **simple_link_preview** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_link_preview: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions to access the internet. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to allow arbitrary loads:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement link previews.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:simple_link_preview/simple_link_preview.dart';
```

2. Use the `LinkPreview` widget to display a link preview in your UI:

```dart
LinkPreview(
  url: 'https://flutter.dev',
  onPreviewDataFetched: (data) {
    // Handle the fetched data
    print(data);
  },
),
```

This widget will automatically fetch the link preview data and display it in your application.

# Complete Example of Simple Link Preview

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_link_preview/simple_link_preview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Link Preview Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Link Preview Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: LinkPreviewWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class LinkPreviewWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LinkPreview(
      url: 'https://flutter.dev', // The URL to fetch the preview for
      onPreviewDataFetched: (data) {
        // This callback is triggered when the preview data is fetched
        print(data); // You can handle the fetched data here
      },
      builder: (context, previewData) {
        // Build your custom UI using the fetched preview data
        return Card(
          child: Column(
            children: [
              Image.network(previewData?.image ?? ''), // Display the image if available
              Text(previewData?.title ?? 'No Title'), // Display the title
              Text(previewData?.description ?? 'No Description'), // Display the description
            ],
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body that centers the LinkPreviewWidget.
// 4. The LinkPreviewWidget uses the LinkPreview widget to fetch and display a preview of the specified URL.
// 5. When the preview data is fetched, it triggers the onPreviewDataFetched callback, where you can handle the data.
// 6. The builder function constructs a Card widget displaying the image, title, and description of the link preview.
```

// The above code demonstrates how to use the simple_link_preview package in a Flutter application. The application fetches a link preview for the specified URL and displays it in a card format. The flow starts from the main function, which initializes the app, and continues through the widget tree until the link preview is displayed. The use of callbacks allows for handling the fetched data effectively, making it easy to customize the UI based on the preview information.
