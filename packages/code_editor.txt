# Tutorial: Setting Up the Code Editor Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **code_editor** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **code_editor** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  code_editor: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/code_editor).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on the features you plan to use. For example, if you are using network features, you might need to add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:code_editor/code_editor.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage
You can now use the `CodeEditor` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
CodeEditor(
  language: 'dart', // Specify the programming language
  onChanged: (code) {
    // Handle code changes
    print('Code changed: $code');
  },
),
```

This basic setup will allow you to start using the code editor in your app. You can customize it further by exploring the various properties and methods provided by the package.

# Complete Example of a Flutter Application Using Code Editor

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:code_editor/code_editor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Code Editor Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CodeEditorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CodeEditorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CodeEditorScreenState createState() => _CodeEditorScreenState();
}

class _CodeEditorScreenState extends State<CodeEditorScreen> {
  String code = 'void main() {\n  print("Hello, World!");\n}'; // Initial code

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Code Editor'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
        child: CodeEditor(
          language: 'dart', // Set the language for syntax highlighting
          initialCode: code, // Load initial code
          onChanged: (newCode) {
            setState(() {
              code = newCode; // Update the code state on change
            });
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with RealFlutterApp.
// 2. RealFlutterApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to CodeEditorScreen, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In CodeEditorScreen, we define an initial code string that will be displayed in the editor.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a CodeEditor widget.
// 6. The CodeEditor widget is configured with the Dart language and the initial code.
// 7. When the code is changed in the editor, the onChanged callback updates the state with the new code.
// 8. The app displays the code editor, allowing users to edit and see their changes in real-time.
```

// Final Summary:
// The application starts with the main function, which initializes the Flutter app. The RealFlutterApp class sets up the MaterialApp and specifies the home screen as CodeEditorScreen. In CodeEditorScreen, we define an initial code snippet and use the CodeEditor widget to allow users to edit the code. The onChanged callback updates the state whenever the code changes, ensuring that the editor reflects the latest input. This simple app demonstrates the core functionality of the code_editor package, showcasing how to integrate a code editing feature into a Flutter application.
