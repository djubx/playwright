# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Breathing Collection Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **breathing_collection** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  breathing_collection: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires microphone access for audio feedback during breathing exercises:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio feedback during breathing exercises.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a breathing exercise using the **breathing_collection** package.

# Complete Example: Breathing Exercise App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:breathing_collection/breathing_collection.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Breathing Exercise App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: BreathingHome(), // Set the home widget
    );
  }
}

class BreathingHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BreathingHomeState createState() => _BreathingHomeState();
}

class _BreathingHomeState extends State<BreathingHome> {
  // Create a BreathingController to manage the breathing exercise
  final BreathingController _breathingController = BreathingController();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the breathing controller with a custom pattern
    _breathingController.setBreathingPattern(
      inhaleDuration: Duration(seconds: 4), // Inhale for 4 seconds
      holdDuration: Duration(seconds: 2),   // Hold for 2 seconds
      exhaleDuration: Duration(seconds: 6),  // Exhale for 6 seconds
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Breathing Exercise'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the breathing animation
            BreathingAnimation(
              controller: _breathingController,
              child: Container(
                width: 200,
                height: 200,
                decoration: BoxDecoration(
                  shape: BoxShape.circle,
                  color: Colors.blueAccent,
                ),
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Breathe',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Start the breathing exercise
                _breathingController.start();
              },
              child: Text('Start Breathing Exercise'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _breathingController.dispose(); // Dispose of the controller
    super.dispose();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The BreathingHome widget is the main screen, which initializes a BreathingController.
// 4. The breathing pattern is set in the initState method, defining inhale, hold, and exhale durations.
// 5. The build method creates a UI with a circular animation and a button to start the breathing exercise.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the breathing exercise starts, and the user is guided through the breathing pattern.
// 7. The controller is disposed of when the widget is removed from the widget tree to free up resources.
```
