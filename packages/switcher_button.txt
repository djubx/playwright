# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `switcher_button` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `switcher_button` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     switcher_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: No additional configuration is required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

## Using the Package

To use the `switcher_button` in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:switcher_button/switcher_button.dart';
   ```

2. **Create a Stateful Widget**: Since the toggle button will change state, create a StatefulWidget:

   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
   }

   class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
     bool _isSwitched = false; // Initial state of the switch

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Switcher Button Example')),
         body: Center(
           child: SwitcherButton(
             value: _isSwitched,
             onChange: (value) {
               setState(() {
                 _isSwitched = value; // Update the state
               });
             },
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Run Your Application**: Use `flutter run` to start your application and see the switcher button in action.

This setup will create a simple application with a toggle button that changes its state when pressed.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:switcher_button/switcher_button.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp widget that serves as the root of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Switcher Button Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Home screen of the app
    );
  }
}

// RealFlutter StatefulWidget to manage the switch state
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isSwitched = false; // Initial state of the switch

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Switcher Button Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: SwitcherButton(
          value: _isSwitched, // Current state of the switch
          onChange: (value) {
            setState(() {
              _isSwitched = value; // Update the state when toggled
            });
          },
          // Optional customization
          onColor: Colors.green, // Color when switched on
          offColor: Colors.red, // Color when switched off
          textOn: 'ON', // Text displayed when switched on
          textOff: 'OFF', // Text displayed when switched off
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home screen as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the switch.
// 4. The initial state of the switch is set to false (off).
// 5. The SwitcherButton widget is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 6. When the switch is toggled, the onChange callback updates the state.
// 7. The UI reflects the current state of the switch, changing colors and text accordingly.
```
