# Tutorial: Setting Up Enough Mail

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **enough_mail** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **enough_mail** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  enough_mail: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/enough_mail).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

This allows your app to make network requests.

## Step 3: Using Enough Mail

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:enough_mail/enough_mail.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class to handle email functionalities.

3. Use the methods provided by the package to send and receive emails.

# Complete Example of Enough Mail

Hereâ€™s a complete example demonstrating how to use the **enough_mail** package in a Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:enough_mail/enough_mail.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Enough Mail Example',
      home: EmailSender(),
    );
  }
}

class EmailSender extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EmailSenderState createState() => _EmailSenderState();
}

class _EmailSenderState extends State<EmailSender> {
  final String smtpServer = 'smtp.example.com'; // Your SMTP server
  final String username = 'your_email@example.com'; // Your email
  final String password = 'your_password'; // Your email password
  final String recipient = 'recipient@example.com'; // Recipient email

  // Function to send email
  Future<void> sendEmail() async {
    // Create an instance of the SMTP client
    final smtpClient = SmtpClient(smtpServer, username, password);

    // Create the email message
    final message = Message()
      ..from = Address(username, 'Your Name')
      ..recipients.add(recipient)
      ..subject = 'Test Email from Flutter'
      ..text = 'This is a test email sent from a Flutter application.';

    try {
      // Send the email
      await smtpClient.send(message);
      print('Email sent successfully!');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error sending email: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Send Email Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: sendEmail, // Call sendEmail when button is pressed
          child: Text('Send Email'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets EmailSender as the home widget.
// 3. EmailSender is a stateful widget that manages the email sending process.
// 4. The sendEmail function creates an SMTP client and constructs an email message.
// 5. When the user presses the "Send Email" button, the sendEmail function is called.
// 6. The email is sent using the SMTP client, and success or error messages are printed to the console.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that sends an email when a button is pressed. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the SMTP client, constructs the email message, and sends it upon user interaction. The console logs provide feedback on the success or failure of the email sending process.

This blog post provides a comprehensive overview of the **enough_mail** package, guiding you through its setup and usage in a Flutter application. With this knowledge, you can easily integrate email functionalities into your own projects.
