Here's a detailed technical blog on the "appscheme" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# AppScheme Flutter Package

The **AppScheme** Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to handle deep linking in their Flutter applications. Deep linking enables users to navigate directly to specific content within an app, enhancing user experience and engagement. This package simplifies the process of setting up and managing deep links across both Android and iOS platforms.

## When to Use AppScheme

You should consider using the AppScheme package when:
- You want to enable deep linking in your Flutter application.
- You need to handle incoming links from external sources, such as emails, social media, or web pages.
- You want to create a seamless user experience by directing users to specific content within your app.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple configuration process for both platforms.
- **Custom URL Schemes**: Define custom URL schemes for your app.
- **Event Handling**: Listen for incoming links and handle them appropriately.

With these features, the AppScheme package is an essential tool for any Flutter developer looking to enhance their app's navigation capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using AppScheme

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the AppScheme package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the AppScheme package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  appscheme: ^latest_version
```

Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure for Android

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following intent filter inside the `<activity>` tag:

```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="your_custom_scheme" />
</intent-filter>
```

Replace `your_custom_scheme` with your desired URL scheme.

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following configuration:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>your_custom_scheme</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

Again, replace `your_custom_scheme` with your desired URL scheme.

## Step 4: Initialize AppScheme in Your App

In your main Dart file, initialize the AppScheme package and set up a listener for incoming links:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appscheme/appscheme.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AppScheme Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    AppScheme.onLinkReceived.listen((link) {
      // Handle the incoming link here
      print('Received link: $link');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Screen')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to AppScheme Example')),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that listens for incoming links.

# Complete Example: AppScheme in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appscheme/appscheme.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AppScheme Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // This variable will hold the incoming link
  String _incomingLink = 'No link received yet';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Listen for incoming links
    AppScheme.onLinkReceived.listen((link) {
      // Update the state with the received link
      setState(() {
        _incomingLink = link;
      });
      // You can navigate to a specific screen based on the link
      // For example: Navigator.pushNamed(context, link);
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Welcome to AppScheme Example'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Incoming Link: $_incomingLink'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp and sets the HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. In the HomeScreen, we listen for incoming links in the initState method.
// 4. When a link is received, we update the _incomingLink variable and rebuild the UI to display the link.
// 5. The UI shows a welcome message and the incoming link, if any.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that listens for incoming deep links. The application displays the received link on the home screen, demonstrating how to handle deep linking using the AppScheme package. 

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application initializes and sets up a listener for incoming links.
- When a link is received, it updates the UI to display the link.
- This allows users to see the deep link content directly within the app, enhancing navigation and user experience.

This structured approach to using the AppScheme package provides a comprehensive understanding of its capabilities and implementation in a Flutter application.
