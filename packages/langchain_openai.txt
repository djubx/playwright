# Overview of the langchain_openai Flutter Package

The `langchain_openai` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to integrate OpenAI's language models into their applications. This package simplifies the process of making API calls to OpenAI, allowing developers to leverage advanced natural language processing capabilities without dealing with the complexities of HTTP requests and responses.

## When to Use This Package
- **Chatbots**: Create intelligent chatbots that can understand and respond to user queries.
- **Content Generation**: Automatically generate text content for blogs, articles, or social media.
- **Text Analysis**: Analyze and summarize large volumes of text data.
- **Interactive Applications**: Build applications that require user interaction through natural language.

## Key Features
- **Easy Integration**: Simplifies the process of connecting to OpenAI's API.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Handles API calls asynchronously, ensuring smooth user experiences.
- **Customizable Requests**: Allows developers to customize the parameters of their API requests.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling to manage API response issues effectively.

Overall, the `langchain_openai` package is an essential tool for developers looking to harness the power of OpenAI's language models in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using langchain_openai

## Installation
To get started with the `langchain_openai` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  langchain_openai: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/langchain_openai).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to make a request to OpenAI's API.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:langchain_openai/langchain_openai.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and make a request:

```dart
class RealFlutter {
  final LangChainOpenAI openAI;

  RealFlutter(this.openAI);

  Future<void> fetchResponse(String prompt) async {
    try {
      final response = await openAI.complete(prompt: prompt);
      print('Response: ${response.text}');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error: $e');
    }
  }
}
```

This setup allows you to send prompts to OpenAI and receive responses seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Using langchain_openai

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:langchain_openai/langchain_openai.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'LangChain OpenAI Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  final LangChainOpenAI openAI = LangChainOpenAI(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');
  String responseText = '';
  final TextEditingController controller = TextEditingController();

  // Function to fetch response from OpenAI
  Future<void> fetchResponse() async {
    final prompt = controller.text; // Get user input from the text field
    try {
      final response = await openAI.complete(prompt: prompt); // Call the API
      setState(() {
        responseText = response.text; // Update the response text
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        responseText = 'Error: $e'; // Handle errors
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('LangChain OpenAI Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: controller, // Bind the controller to the text field
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your prompt'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: fetchResponse, // Fetch response on button press
              child: Text('Get Response'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Response: $responseText'), // Display the response
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts with a simple Flutter app that has a text field and a button.
// The user enters a prompt in the text field and presses the button to get a response from OpenAI.
// The `fetchResponse` function is called when the button is pressed.
// It retrieves the text from the text field and sends it to the OpenAI API using the `complete` method.
// The response is then displayed on the screen.
// If an error occurs during the API call, it is caught and displayed instead of the response.
