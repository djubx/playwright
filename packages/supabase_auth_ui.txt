# Supabase Auth UI Flutter Package

The `supabase_auth_ui` package is a powerful tool for integrating authentication features into Flutter applications using Supabase as the backend. Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative that provides a suite of tools for building applications, including authentication, database management, and real-time capabilities.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `supabase_auth_ui` package when:
- You need a quick and easy way to implement user authentication in your Flutter app.
- You want to leverage Supabase's backend services for user management, including sign-up, sign-in, password recovery, and social logins.
- You prefer a customizable UI for authentication that can be easily integrated into your existing Flutter application.

## Features

- **Pre-built UI Components**: The package provides pre-built UI components for common authentication tasks, such as sign-up and sign-in forms.
- **Customizable**: You can easily customize the appearance of the authentication UI to match your app's design.
- **Support for Multiple Auth Providers**: The package supports various authentication providers, including email/password, OAuth providers (like Google, GitHub, etc.), and magic link authentication.
- **Real-time Updates**: It integrates seamlessly with Supabase's real-time capabilities, allowing you to respond to authentication state changes in real-time.

By using the `supabase_auth_ui` package, developers can save time and effort in implementing authentication features, allowing them to focus on building the core functionalities of their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Supabase Auth UI in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `supabase_auth_ui` package in a Flutter application. We will cover platform-specific details for both Android and iOS, as well as any required configurations.

## Step 1: Create a New Flutter Project

First, create a new Flutter project using the following command:

```bash
flutter create supabase_auth_example
cd supabase_auth_example
```

## Step 2: Add Dependencies

Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `supabase` and `supabase_auth_ui` packages:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  supabase: ^0.2.0
  supabase_auth_ui: ^0.1.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependencies.

## Step 3: Configure Supabase

1. **Create a Supabase Project**: Go to the [Supabase website](https://supabase.io/) and create a new project. Once created, you will receive a URL and an API key.

2. **Initialize Supabase**: In your Flutter app, initialize Supabase in the `main.dart` file. You can do this in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:supabase/supabase.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Supabase with your URL and API key
  Supabase.initialize(
    url: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL',
    anonKey: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY',
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Platform-Specific Configurations

### For Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add internet permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### For iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 11.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our application. The next section will provide a complete example of how to implement the authentication UI.

# Complete Example: Supabase Auth UI in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:supabase/supabase.dart';
import 'package:supabase_auth_ui/supabase_auth_ui.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Supabase with your URL and API key
  Supabase.initialize(
    url: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL',
    anonKey: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY',
  );
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Supabase Auth UI Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: AuthScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class AuthScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Authentication'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: SupabaseAuthUi(
          // This widget provides the authentication UI
          onAuthSuccess: (session) {
            // Handle successful authentication
            Navigator.pushReplacement(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => HomeScreen()),
            );
          },
          onAuthError: (error) {
            // Handle authentication error
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text(error.message)),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.logout),
            onPressed: () async {
              // Log out the user
              await Supabase.instance.client.auth.signOut();
              Navigator.pushReplacement(
                context,
                MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => AuthScreen()),
              );
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing Supabase with the provided URL and API key.
// 2. The main widget is `RealFlutter`, which sets up the MaterialApp and the home screen.
// 3. The `AuthScreen` widget displays the Supabase authentication UI.
// 4. Upon successful authentication, the user is navigated to the `HomeScreen`.
// 5. The `HomeScreen` displays a welcome message and a logout button.
// 6. When the logout button is pressed, the user is signed out and redirected back to the `AuthScreen`.
```
