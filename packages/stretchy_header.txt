# Stretchy Header Flutter Package

The **stretchy_header** package for Flutter is a powerful tool that allows developers to create flexible and visually appealing headers that can stretch and collapse as the user scrolls through a list. This package is particularly useful for applications that require a dynamic user interface, such as social media apps, news apps, or any app that displays a list of items with a prominent header.

- **Easy Integration**: The package is designed to be easy to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

## When to Use
You should consider using the **stretchy_header** package when:
- You want to enhance the user experience with a visually appealing header.
- Your application has a list of items that benefit from a prominent header.
- You need a header that can adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

Overall, the **stretchy_header** package is an excellent choice for developers looking to create modern and responsive UIs in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Stretchy Header Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the **stretchy_header** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  stretchy_header: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that you have the package installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a stretchy header.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stretchy_header/stretchy_header.dart';
```

2. Create a basic Flutter app structure and use the `StretchyHeader` widget:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: StretchyHeader(
          header: Container(
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Stretchy Header',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ),
          ),
          body: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: 50,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application to see the stretchy header in action!

# Complete Example of Stretchy Header in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stretchy_header/stretchy_header.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: StretchyHeader(
          // The header widget that will stretch and collapse
          header: Container(
            color: Colors.blue,
            height: 200, // Initial height of the header
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Stretchy Header',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ),
          ),
          // The body of the list that will scroll
          body: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: 50, // Number of items in the list
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'), // Each item in the list
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with a body that contains the StretchyHeader widget.
// 4. The StretchyHeader widget has two main components: a header and a body.
// 5. The header is a Container with a blue background and a centered text.
// 6. The body is a ListView.builder that generates a list of 50 items.
// 7. As the user scrolls through the list, the header will stretch and collapse, providing a dynamic user experience.
