Here's a detailed technical blog on the "freezed_result" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Freezed Result Flutter Package

The `freezed_result` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of creating immutable data classes with union types. It leverages the `freezed` package to provide a clean and efficient way to handle state management, especially in scenarios where you need to represent multiple states or results, such as success, failure, or loading states.

## When to Use `freezed_result`

You should consider using `freezed_result` in the following scenarios:

- **State Management**: When managing complex states in your application, such as loading, success, and error states.
- **Immutable Data Classes**: When you need to create immutable data classes that can be easily compared and copied.
- **Union Types**: When you want to represent a value that can be one of several types, making your code more expressive and type-safe.

## Features

- **Immutable Data Classes**: Automatically generates immutable classes with copy and equality methods.
- **Union Types**: Easily define types that can represent multiple states.
- **Code Generation**: Reduces boilerplate code through code generation, making your codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `freezed_result`

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

To get started with `freezed_result`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file along with the `freezed` package:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  freezed_result: ^latest_version
  freezed: ^latest_version

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^latest_version
  freezed: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Step 2: Run Build Runner

After adding the dependencies, run the following command to generate the necessary files:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This command will generate the required code for your data classes.

## Step 3: Create Your Data Classes

Now, you can create your data classes using the `freezed_result` package. Here’s an example of how to define a result type:

```dart
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';

part 'result.freezed.dart';

@freezed
class Result<T> with _$Result<T> {
  const factory Result.success(T data) = Success<T>;
  const factory Result.failure(String error) = Failure<T>;
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Result Class

You can now use the `Result` class in your application to handle different states. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
void handleResult(Result<String> result) {
  result.when(
    success: (data) {
      print('Data: $data');
    },
    failure: (error) {
      print('Error: $error');
    },
  );
}
```

This function will print the data if the result is successful or print the error message if it fails.

# Complete Example of Using `freezed_result`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';

part 'result.freezed.dart';

// Define the Result class using Freezed
@freezed
class Result<T> with _$Result<T> {
  const factory Result.success(T data) = Success<T>; // Represents a successful result
  const factory Result.failure(String error) = Failure<T>; // Represents a failure result
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Freezed Result Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Freezed Result Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Simulate a successful result
            final result = Result.success("Hello, Freezed!");
            handleResult(result); // Handle the result
          },
          child: Text('Get Result'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Function to handle the Result
void handleResult(Result<String> result) {
  // Use the when method to handle different states
  result.when(
    success: (data) {
      // If the result is successful, print the data
      print('Data: $data');
    },
    failure: (error) {
      // If the result is a failure, print the error
      print('Error: $error');
    },
  );
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
2. `MyApp` builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
3. The `HomeScreen` widget contains a button that, when pressed, simulates a successful result.
4. The `handleResult` function is called with the simulated result.
5. Inside `handleResult`, the `when` method is used to check the result type.
6. If the result is successful, it prints the data; if it fails, it prints the error.
