# Bilocator Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **bilocator** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of managing and utilizing multiple locations within an application. It is particularly useful for applications that require geolocation features, such as ride-sharing apps, delivery services, or any app that needs to track user locations or display maps.

## When to Use Bilocator
- **Location Tracking**: If your app needs to track the user's current location or multiple locations simultaneously.
- **Geofencing**: For applications that require monitoring specific geographic areas.
- **Map Integration**: When you need to display multiple locations on a map.

## Key Features
- **Multiple Location Management**: Easily manage and switch between multiple locations.
- **Real-time Location Updates**: Get real-time updates on the user's location.
- **Geofencing Capabilities**: Set up geofences to trigger actions when entering or exiting specific areas.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

The bilocator package is an excellent choice for developers looking to integrate location-based features into their Flutter applications efficiently.

# Bilocator Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the bilocator package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  bilocator: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/bilocator).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open the `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/`.
2. Add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
After setting up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and use bilocator to get the user's current location.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bilocator/bilocator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _currentLocation = "Unknown";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getCurrentLocation();
  }

  Future<void> _getCurrentLocation() async {
    // Initialize bilocator
    Bilocator bilocator = Bilocator();
    
    // Request location permission
    await bilocator.requestPermission();

    // Get the current location
    var location = await bilocator.getCurrentLocation();
    
    setState(() {
      _currentLocation = "${location.latitude}, ${location.longitude}";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Bilocator Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: Text("Current Location: $_currentLocation"),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the bilocator package, request location permissions, and retrieve the user's current location, which is then displayed on the screen.

# Complete Example of Bilocator in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bilocator/bilocator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _currentLocation = "Unknown"; // Variable to hold the current location

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getCurrentLocation(); // Call the method to get the current location
  }

  Future<void> _getCurrentLocation() async {
    // Initialize bilocator
    Bilocator bilocator = Bilocator();
    
    // Request location permission
    await bilocator.requestPermission();

    // Get the current location
    var location = await bilocator.getCurrentLocation();
    
    setState(() {
      // Update the state with the current location
      _currentLocation = "${location.latitude}, ${location.longitude}";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Bilocator Example")), // App bar with title
      body: Center(
        child: Text("Current Location: $_currentLocation"), // Display current location
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, _getCurrentLocation is called to fetch the user's location.
// 3. Inside _getCurrentLocation, an instance of Bilocator is created.
// 4. The app requests location permissions from the user.
// 5. Once permissions are granted, the app retrieves the current location.
// 6. The current location is then displayed on the screen by updating the state.
```
