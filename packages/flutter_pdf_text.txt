# Setting Up and Using the Flutter PDF Text Package

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of setting up the `flutter_pdf_text` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it to extract text from PDF files.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `flutter_pdf_text` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_pdf_text: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configuration:

```gradle
android {
    compileSdkVersion 33
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
        targetSdkVersion 33
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` is configured to use at least iOS 11.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

## Using the Package

To use the `flutter_pdf_text` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_pdf_text/flutter_pdf_text.dart';
```

<-- START_MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pdf_text/flutter_pdf_text.dart';

void main() => runApp(RealFlutterApp());

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter PDF Text Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: PDFTextExtractor(),
    );
  }
}

class PDFTextExtractor extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PDFTextExtractorState createState() => _PDFTextExtractorState();
}

class _PDFTextExtractorState extends State<PDFTextExtractor> {
  String _extractedText = "Loading...";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _extractTextFromPDF();
  }

  Future<void> _extractTextFromPDF() async {
    try {
      // Create a PDF document object from a file path
      final pdfDoc = await PDFDoc.fromPath('assets/sample.pdf');
      
      // Extract text from the first page
      String text = await pdfDoc.text;
      
      // Update the state with the extracted text
      setState(() {
        _extractedText = text;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors during text extraction
      setState(() {
        _extractedText = "Failed to extract text: $e";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Text Extractor'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: SingleChildScrollView(
          child: Text(_extractedText),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The application starts with the `RealFlutterApp` widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The `PDFTextExtractor` widget is the home screen, which is a stateful widget.
// 3. In the `initState` method, `_extractTextFromPDF` is called to start the text extraction process.
// 4. `_extractTextFromPDF` uses the `flutter_pdf_text` package to load a PDF document and extract text from it.
// 5. The extracted text is stored in the `_extractedText` state variable.
// 6. The `build` method displays the extracted text in a scrollable view within the app's main screen.
// 7. If an error occurs during text extraction, an error message is displayed instead.
