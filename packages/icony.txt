# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Icony

## Step 1: Adding Icony to Your Project

To get started with the Icony package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  icony: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Configuring for Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21  // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Configuring for iOS

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file to ensure proper icon rendering:

```xml
<key>UIAppFonts</key>
<array>
    <string>YourCustomFont.ttf</string>  <!-- Add your custom font files here -->
</array>
```

## Step 4: Using Icony in Your Flutter App

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use Icony to display a custom icon.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:icony/icony.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Icony Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Icony(
            icon: 'your_custom_icon',  // Replace with your icon name
            size: 50.0,
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we import the Icony package and use it to display a custom icon in the center of the screen. You can customize the icon's size and color as needed.

# Complete Example of Using Icony

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:icony/icony.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Icony Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the icon in the middle of the screen
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Displaying a custom icon using Icony
              Icony(
                icon: 'your_custom_icon',  // Replace with your icon name
                size: 100.0,  // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue,  // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),  // Adding space between the icon and the text
              Text(
                'This is a custom icon from Icony!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),  // Styling the text
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. A Column widget is used to stack the Icony widget and a Text widget vertically.
// 7. The Icony widget displays a custom icon, with specified size and color.
// 8. A SizedBox is used to add space between the icon and the text.
// 9. The Text widget displays a message below the icon, styled with a larger font size.
```
