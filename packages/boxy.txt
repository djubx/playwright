# Boxy Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The Boxy package for Flutter is a powerful tool designed to provide advanced layout capabilities beyond the standard widgets available in Flutter. It allows developers to create complex, custom layouts with ease, offering flexibility and control over the positioning and sizing of child widgets.

## When to Use Boxy

Boxy is particularly useful in scenarios where the default layout widgets like `Column`, `Row`, or `Stack` fall short. For instance, if you need to create a layout where widgets overlap in a non-linear fashion or require dynamic resizing based on content, Boxy can be a perfect fit. It is ideal for:

- Creating custom layouts that require precise control over child widget positioning.
- Building responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
- Implementing complex UI components that need custom alignment and spacing.

## Key Features

- **Custom Layouts**: Define your own layout logic to position and size child widgets.
- **Flexibility**: Easily adapt layouts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance, ensuring smooth and responsive UIs.
- **Ease of Use**: Intuitive API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter widgets.

# Setting Up and Using the Boxy Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the Boxy package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it to create custom layouts.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the Boxy package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     boxy: ^0.1.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependency.

3. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the Boxy package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:boxy/boxy.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

No additional configuration is required for Android. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support all Boxy features.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Using Boxy

To use Boxy, you will typically extend the `BoxyDelegate` class to define custom layout logic. Here's a simple example:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends BoxyDelegate {
  @override
  Size layout() {
    // Custom layout logic goes here
  }
}
```

<-- MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:boxy/boxy.dart';

// Main function to run the Flutter app
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Root widget of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Boxy Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// Home page of the application
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Boxy Layout Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CustomBoxy(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Custom widget using Boxy for layout
class CustomBoxy extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Boxy(
      delegate: RealFlutter(),
      children: [
        Positioned(
          left: 10,
          top: 10,
          child: Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.red,
          ),
        ),
        Positioned(
          left: 50,
          top: 50,
          child: Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.green,
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Custom BoxyDelegate to define layout logic
class RealFlutter extends BoxyDelegate {
  @override
  Size layout() {
    // Access the children of the Boxy widget
    final redBox = children[0];
    final greenBox = children[1];

    // Position the red box
    redBox.layout(constraints);
    redBox.position(Offset(10, 10));

    // Position the green box
    greenBox.layout(constraints);
    greenBox.position(Offset(50, 50));

    // Return the size of the layout
    return Size(150, 150);
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The `MyApp` widget sets up the MaterialApp and defines the theme and home page.
// 2. The `HomePage` widget creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered `CustomBoxy` widget.
// 3. The `CustomBoxy` widget uses the Boxy package to create a custom layout with two positioned containers.
// 4. The `RealFlutter` class extends `BoxyDelegate` to define the layout logic, positioning the red and green boxes.
// 5. The layout method positions the boxes and returns the overall size of the layout.
```

In this example, we demonstrated how to use the Boxy package to create a custom layout in a Flutter application. The `RealFlutter` class extends `BoxyDelegate` to define the layout logic, allowing precise control over the positioning of child widgets. This approach provides flexibility and performance, making it ideal for complex UI designs.

By following this tutorial, you should now have a good understanding of how to set up and use the Boxy package in your Flutter projects. Experiment with different layouts and configurations to fully leverage the power of Boxy in your applications.
