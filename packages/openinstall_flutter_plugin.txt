```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:openinstall_flutter_plugin/openinstall_flutter_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  OpeninstallFlutterPlugin _openinstallFlutterPlugin = OpeninstallFlutterPlugin();

  Future<void> _initOpeninstall() async {
    // Initialize the package
    await _openinstallFlutterPlugin.init();
  }

  Future<void> _getInstallData() async {
    // Get the install data
    Map<String, dynamic> installData = await _openinstallFlutterPlugin.getInstallData();
    print(installData);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Openinstall Flutter Plugin Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _initOpeninstall,
                child: Text('Initialize Openinstall'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _getInstallData,
                child: Text('Get Install Data'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and the _initOpeninstall function is called to initialize the package.
// 2. The _initOpeninstall function initializes the package and sets up the necessary configurations.
// 3. The user clicks the "Get Install Data" button and the _getInstallData function is called.
// 4. The _getInstallData function retrieves the install data from the package and prints it to the console.
// 5. The install data can be used to track and reward users for inviting friends to install the app.
```

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// The user initializes the package, then retrieves the install data, which can be used to track and reward users for inviting friends to install the app.
