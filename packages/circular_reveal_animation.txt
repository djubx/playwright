# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Circular Reveal Animation Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `circular_reveal_animation` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  circular_reveal_animation: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a circular reveal animation.

# Complete Example of Circular Reveal Animation

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:circular_reveal_animation/circular_reveal_animation.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  // State variable to control the visibility of the reveal animation
  bool _isRevealed = false;

  // Function to toggle the reveal state
  void _toggleReveal() {
    setState(() {
      _isRevealed = !_isRevealed;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Circular Reveal Animation Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: GestureDetector(
            onTap: _toggleReveal, // Toggle reveal on tap
            child: CircularRevealAnimation(
              // The animation starts from the center of the widget
              center: Offset(MediaQuery.of(context).size.width / 2, MediaQuery.of(context).size.height / 2),
              // The animation's radius
              radius: _isRevealed ? 200 : 0,
              // The widget to reveal
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Tap to Reveal',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              // Duration of the animation
              duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
              // Whether to show the widget or not
              isRevealed: _isRevealed,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the reveal animation.
// 3. The _isRevealed boolean variable determines whether the content is revealed or hidden.
// 4. The _toggleReveal function toggles the _isRevealed state when the user taps the screen.
// 5. The CircularRevealAnimation widget is used to create the reveal effect.
// 6. The center of the animation is set to the center of the screen, and the radius changes based on the _isRevealed state.
// 7. When the user taps the screen, the animation is triggered, revealing the blue container with the text "Tap to Reveal".
// 8. The animation lasts for 1 second, providing a smooth transition effect.
