    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` in your `Info.plist` file to allow access to the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to display images.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `gallery_zoom_slides` package, you can create a simple gallery view in your Flutter application. Below is a basic example of how to implement it.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gallery_zoom_slides/gallery_zoom_slides.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample list of image URLs
    final List<String> imageUrls = [
      'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
      'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
      'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
    ];

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Gallery Zoom Slides Example')),
        body: GalleryZoomSlides(
          images: imageUrls,
          // Optional: Customize the gallery appearance
          backgroundColor: Colors.black,
          // Optional: Enable or disable swipe navigation
          enableSwipe: true,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic gallery with zoom functionality. You can customize the appearance and behavior as needed.

# Complete Example of Gallery Zoom Slides

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gallery_zoom_slides/gallery_zoom_slides.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample list of image URLs
    final List<String> imageUrls = [
      'https://example.com/image1.jpg', // First image URL
      'https://example.com/image2.jpg', // Second image URL
      'https://example.com/image3.jpg', // Third image URL
    ];

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Gallery Zoom Slides Example')), // App bar title
        body: GalleryZoomSlides(
          images: imageUrls, // Pass the list of image URLs
          backgroundColor: Colors.black, // Set background color for the gallery
          enableSwipe: true, // Enable swipe navigation between images
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app with RealFlutter as the main widget
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The app starts with the `main()` function, which calls `runApp()` to launch the `RealFlutter` widget.
2. Inside the `RealFlutter` widget, a list of image URLs is defined.
3. The `MaterialApp` widget is created, providing a basic structure for the app.
4. A `Scaffold` widget is used to create the app's visual layout, including an AppBar and a body.
5. The `GalleryZoomSlides` widget is instantiated with the list of image URLs, a black background, and swipe navigation enabled.
6. When the app runs, users can swipe through the images and zoom in/out for a detailed view.
