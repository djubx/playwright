# Setting Up and Using the Supercharged Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Supercharged package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the Supercharged package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  supercharged: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Supercharged Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's explore how to use it in your Flutter application. Below are some examples of how to utilize the features of Supercharged.

### Example Usage

1. **String Extensions**: You can easily manipulate strings using the provided extensions.

```dart
String name = "flutter";
print(name.capitalize()); // Output: Flutter
```

2. **List Extensions**: Supercharged allows you to perform operations on lists more intuitively.

```dart
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
print(numbers.sum()); // Output: 10
```

3. **Map Extensions**: You can also work with maps more effectively.

```dart
Map<String, int> scores = {'Alice': 90, 'Bob': 85};
print(scores.getOrDefault('Charlie', 0)); // Output: 0
```

With these examples, you can see how Supercharged enhances the functionality of standard Dart types, making your code cleaner and more expressive.

# Complete Example of a Flutter Application Using Supercharged

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:supercharged/supercharged.dart'; // Importing the Supercharged package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Entry point of the application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Supercharged Example',
      home: HomeScreen(), // Setting the home screen of the app
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Using a Scaffold widget to provide a basic material design layout
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Supercharged Flutter Package'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a capitalized string using Supercharged
            Text(
              'Hello, ${'flutter'.capitalize()}!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Displaying the sum of a list of numbers
            Text(
              'Sum of numbers: ${[1, 2, 3, 4].sum()}', // Using the sum extension
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Displaying a default value for a non-existing key in a map
            Text(
              'Score of Charlie: ${{'Alice': 90, 'Bob': 85}.getOrDefault('Charlie', 0)}', // Using getOrDefault extension
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() to start the app.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp, setting the title and home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen is another StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 6. A Column widget is used to arrange the text widgets vertically.
// 7. Each Text widget demonstrates a feature of the Supercharged package, such as string manipulation, list summation, and map default values.
```
