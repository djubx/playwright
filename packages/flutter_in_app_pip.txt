# flutter_in_app_pip Package Overview

The `flutter_in_app_pip` package is a powerful Flutter plugin that allows developers to implement Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode in their applications. This feature is particularly useful for media applications, such as video players or live streaming apps, where users may want to continue watching content while interacting with other apps.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_in_app_pip` package in scenarios such as:
- **Video Streaming Apps**: Allow users to watch videos while browsing other content.
- **Live Streaming**: Enable users to keep an eye on live events while multitasking.
- **Educational Apps**: Let users watch tutorials or lectures while taking notes or performing tasks in other applications.

## Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Easy to integrate with existing Flutter applications.
- **Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, providing a consistent experience across devices.
- **Customizable UI**: Allows developers to customize the PiP window to fit their app's design.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Handles the lifecycle of the PiP mode, ensuring a smooth user experience.

By leveraging this package, developers can enhance user engagement and provide a more versatile application experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_in_app_pip

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_in_app_pip` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_in_app_pip` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_in_app_pip: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_in_app_pip).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions and configuration inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<activity
    android:name="com.example.yourapp.MainActivity"
    android:resizeableActivity="true"
    android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize|smallestScreenSize|keyboardHidden|keyboard|locale|layoutDirection|fontScale|screenLayout|direction|uiMode"
    android:label="Your App Name"
    android:theme="@style/LaunchTheme">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to enable PiP:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have configured the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement PiP mode.

# Complete Example of flutter_in_app_pip

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_in_app_pip/flutter_in_app_pip.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to track if PiP mode is active
  bool isInPiPMode = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the PiP manager
    FlutterInAppPip.initialize();
  }

  // Function to enter PiP mode
  void enterPiP() {
    FlutterInAppPip.enterPiPMode();
    setState(() {
      isInPiPMode = true; // Update state to reflect PiP mode
    });
  }

  // Function to exit PiP mode
  void exitPiP() {
    FlutterInAppPip.exitPiPMode();
    setState(() {
      isInPiPMode = false; // Update state to reflect exit from PiP mode
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter In-App PiP Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text(
                isInPiPMode ? 'In PiP Mode' : 'Not in PiP Mode',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: isInPiPMode ? exitPiP : enterPiP,
                child: Text(isInPiPMode ? 'Exit PiP' : 'Enter PiP'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget initializes the FlutterInAppPip package in its initState method.
// 3. The UI consists of a text widget indicating whether the app is in PiP mode and a button to toggle PiP mode.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it either enters or exits PiP mode, updating the state accordingly.
// 5. The UI reflects the current state, providing feedback to the user.
```
