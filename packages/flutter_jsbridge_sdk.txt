# flutter_jsbridge_sdk: Bridging Flutter and JavaScript

The `flutter_jsbridge_sdk` package is designed to facilitate communication between Flutter applications and JavaScript code. This package is particularly useful for developers who need to integrate web-based functionalities or libraries into their Flutter apps, allowing for a seamless interaction between Dart and JavaScript.

## When to Use This Package
- **WebView Integration**: When you need to execute JavaScript within a WebView and communicate back and forth between Flutter and the web content.
- **Hybrid Applications**: For applications that require both native and web functionalities, such as using existing JavaScript libraries.
- **Dynamic Content**: When your app needs to load and execute JavaScript dynamically based on user interactions or external data.

## Key Features
- **Two-way Communication**: Enables sending messages and data between Flutter and JavaScript.
- **Event Handling**: Supports event listeners for handling JavaScript events in Flutter.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple API for integrating JavaScript code into Flutter applications.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Setting Up flutter_jsbridge_sdk

To get started with the `flutter_jsbridge_sdk`, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_jsbridge_sdk: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_jsbridge_sdk).

2. **Run Flutter Packages Get**: After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations. You may need to add internet permissions if your JavaScript code requires network access.

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. **Update Info.plist**: For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow arbitrary loads if your JavaScript is hosted on a non-secure server.

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Basic Usage

Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a bridge between Flutter and JavaScript.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_jsbridge_sdk/flutter_jsbridge_sdk.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late JsBridge _jsBridge;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _jsBridge = JsBridge();
    _jsBridge.onMessage.listen((message) {
      // Handle messages from JavaScript
      print("Received from JS: $message");
    });
  }

  void _sendMessageToJs() {
    _jsBridge.sendMessage("Hello from Flutter!");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Flutter JS Bridge Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _sendMessageToJs,
          child: Text("Send Message to JS"),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that sends a message to JavaScript when a button is pressed.

# Complete Example of flutter_jsbridge_sdk

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_jsbridge_sdk/flutter_jsbridge_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late JsBridge _jsBridge;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the JsBridge instance
    _jsBridge = JsBridge();
    
    // Listen for messages from JavaScript
    _jsBridge.onMessage.listen((message) {
      // Print the message received from JavaScript
      print("Received from JS: $message");
    });
  }

  void _sendMessageToJs() {
    // Send a message to JavaScript
    _jsBridge.sendMessage("Hello from Flutter!");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Flutter JS Bridge Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _sendMessageToJs,
          child: Text("Send Message to JS"),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, initializing the JsBridge instance in initState.
// 3. A listener is set up to handle messages received from JavaScript.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _sendMessageToJs method is called.
// 5. This method sends a message to the JavaScript context.
// 6. Any messages sent from JavaScript will be printed to the console.
```
