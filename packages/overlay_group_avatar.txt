# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Overlay Group Avatar

## Installation
To get started with the `overlay_group_avatar` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  overlay_group_avatar: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/overlay_group_avatar).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `OverlayGroupAvatar` widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:overlay_group_avatar/overlay_group_avatar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Overlay Group Avatar Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: OverlayGroupAvatar(
          avatars: [
            'https://example.com/avatar1.png',
            'https://example.com/avatar2.png',
            'https://example.com/avatar3.png',
          ],
          onTap: () {
            // Handle tap event
            print('Group avatar tapped!');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that displays a group avatar in the center of the screen. The `onTap` callback allows you to define what happens when the avatar is tapped.

# Complete Example of Overlay Group Avatar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:overlay_group_avatar/overlay_group_avatar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Overlay Group Avatar Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Overlay Group Avatar Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: OverlayGroupAvatar(
          avatars: [
            'https://example.com/avatar1.png', // First avatar URL
            'https://example.com/avatar2.png', // Second avatar URL
            'https://example.com/avatar3.png', // Third avatar URL
          ],
          onTap: () {
            // Handle tap event
            print('Group avatar tapped!'); // Log tap event
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, the OverlayGroupAvatar is created with a list of avatar URLs.
// 5. When the group avatar is tapped, the onTap callback is triggered, logging a message to the console.
