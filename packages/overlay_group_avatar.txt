// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, and the `MyApp` widget is rendered.
// 2. The `MyApp` widget returns a `MaterialApp` widget with the `RealFlutter` widget as its home.
// 3. The `RealFlutter` widget defines a list of network images and returns a `Scaffold` widget with an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget.
// 4. The `Center` widget contains a `Column` widget with two `OverlayGroupAvatar` widgets.
// 5. The first `OverlayGroupAvatar` widget uses the defined list of avatars and displays them in a circular shape with a size of 100.
// 6. The second `OverlayGroupAvatar` widget uses the same list of avatars but adds a custom overlay layer with a red circle.
// 7. The user can view the two different overlay group avatars and interact with them as needed.
