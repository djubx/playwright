<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_chess_board/simple_chess_board.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Chess Board',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Simple Chess Board Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ChessBoardWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ChessBoardWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ChessBoardWidgetState createState() => _ChessBoardWidgetState();
}

class _ChessBoardWidgetState extends State<ChessBoardWidget> {
  // Create a ChessBoardController to manage the game state
  final ChessBoardController _controller = ChessBoardController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the chess board
        SimpleChessBoard(
          controller: _controller,
          onMove: (move) {
            // Handle the move made by the player
            print('Move made: $move');
          },
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Reset the board to the initial state
            _controller.reset();
          },
          child: Text('Reset Board'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the ChessBoardWidget.
// 3. The ChessBoardWidget is a StatefulWidget that manages the chess board state using ChessBoardController.
// 4. Inside the ChessBoardWidget, the SimpleChessBoard widget is created, which displays the chess board.
// 5. The onMove callback is triggered whenever a player makes a move, allowing you to handle the move logic.
// 6. An ElevatedButton is provided to reset the board to its initial state, demonstrating interactivity.
```
