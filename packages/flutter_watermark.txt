# flutter_watermark Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_watermark` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_watermark: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_watermark).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if you are accessing the device's photo library. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to add watermarks to your images.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `flutter_watermark` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_watermark/flutter_watermark.dart';
   ```

2. Create a function to apply a watermark to an image:
   ```dart
   Future<void> addWatermark() async {
       // Load your image
       final image = await loadImage('path_to_your_image');

       // Create a watermark
       final watermark = Watermark(
           text: 'Your Watermark',
           position: WatermarkPosition.bottomRight,
           opacity: 0.5,
       );

       // Apply the watermark
       final watermarkedImage = await watermark.apply(image);
       
       // Save or display the watermarked image
       await saveImage(watermarkedImage);
   }
   ```

This setup will allow you to add a watermark to images in your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of flutter_watermark

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_watermark/flutter_watermark.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Watermark Example',
      home: WatermarkHome(),
    );
  }
}

class WatermarkHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WatermarkHomeState createState() => _WatermarkHomeState();
}

class _WatermarkHomeState extends State<WatermarkHome> {
  // Variable to hold the watermarked image
  Image? watermarkedImage;

  // Function to add watermark to an image
  Future<void> addWatermark() async {
    // Load your image from assets or any source
    final image = await loadImage('assets/sample_image.png');

    // Create a watermark with text
    final watermark = Watermark(
      text: 'Your Watermark',
      position: WatermarkPosition.bottomRight,
      opacity: 0.5,
    );

    // Apply the watermark to the image
    final result = await watermark.apply(image);

    // Update the state with the watermarked image
    setState(() {
      watermarkedImage = Image.memory(result);
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Watermark Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the watermarked image if available
            watermarkedImage ?? Text('No image watermarked yet.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: addWatermark,
              child: Text('Add Watermark'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (WatermarkHome).
// 3. WatermarkHome is a stateful widget that manages the state of the watermarked image.
// 4. The addWatermark function is called when the button is pressed.
// 5. Inside addWatermark, an image is loaded, and a watermark is created with specified text, position, and opacity.
// 6. The watermark is applied to the image, and the state is updated to display the watermarked image.
// 7. The UI shows the watermarked image or a message if no image has been watermarked yet.
