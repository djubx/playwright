# Overview of the `size_setter` Flutter Package

The `size_setter` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create responsive and adaptive user interfaces. It provides a straightforward way to manage widget sizes based on the screen dimensions, ensuring that your app looks great on any device, whether it's a small phone or a large tablet.

## When to Use `size_setter`

- **Responsive Design**: When you need your app to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations seamlessly.
- **Dynamic Layouts**: For applications that require dynamic resizing of widgets based on user interactions or device changes.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Ensures that your app maintains a consistent look and feel across both Android and iOS platforms.

## Key Features

- **Easy Integration**: Simple to add to any Flutter project with minimal setup.
- **Flexible API**: Offers a range of methods to set sizes relative to screen dimensions.
- **Platform Agnostic**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS without any platform-specific code.

# Setting Up and Using the `size_setter` Package

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of setting up the `size_setter` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `size_setter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     size_setter: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the `size_setter` package.

   ```dart
   import 'package:size_setter/size_setter.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support all features of the package.

  ```gradle
  android {
      defaultConfig {
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

### iOS

- No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`.

  ```ruby
  platform :ios, '9.0'
  ```

## Using `size_setter`

To use `size_setter`, wrap your widgets with `SizeSetter` and specify the desired size relative to the screen dimensions.

```dart
SizeSetter(
  widthFactor: 0.5, // 50% of the screen width
  heightFactor: 0.3, // 30% of the screen height
  child: RealFlutter(), // Your main widget
)
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:size_setter/size_setter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Size Setter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Size Setter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: SizeSetter(
          widthFactor: 0.8, // Set the width to 80% of the screen width
          heightFactor: 0.5, // Set the height to 50% of the screen height
          child: RealFlutter(), // Main widget that will be resized
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      color: Colors.amber,
      child: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Hello, RealFlutter!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by calling `runApp` with `MyApp`.
// 2. `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The `HomeScreen` widget is the main screen of the app, containing an AppBar and a centered body.
// 4. Inside the body, `SizeSetter` is used to wrap the `RealFlutter` widget, setting its size relative to the screen.
// 5. `RealFlutter` is a simple widget displaying a text message, styled and centered within a colored container.
// 6. The `SizeSetter` dynamically adjusts the size of `RealFlutter` based on the screen dimensions, ensuring responsiveness.
