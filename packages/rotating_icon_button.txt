# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Rotating Icon Button

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `rotating_icon_button` package in a Flutter application and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `rotating_icon_button` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rotating_icon_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Rotating Icon Button

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the rotating icon button.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rotating_icon_button/rotating_icon_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rotating Icon Button Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RotatingIconButton(
            icon: Icons.refresh,
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform when the button is pressed
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Duration of the rotation
            rotationDirection: RotationDirection.clockwise, // Direction of rotation
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a rotating icon button in the center of the screen. The button rotates when pressed, providing visual feedback to the user.

# Complete Example of Rotating Icon Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rotating_icon_button/rotating_icon_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rotating Icon Button Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RotatingIconButton(
            icon: Icons.refresh, // The icon to be displayed on the button
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform when the button is pressed
              print('Button Pressed!'); // Log message for button press
            },
            duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Duration of the rotation animation
            rotationDirection: RotationDirection.clockwise, // Set rotation direction
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the application
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, we place the RotatingIconButton.
4. The RotatingIconButton is configured with an icon (refresh), a duration for the rotation animation, and a callback function for the onPressed event.
5. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback, which currently prints a message to the console.
6. The button rotates clockwise for the specified duration, providing visual feedback to the user.
