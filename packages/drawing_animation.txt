# Drawing Animation Flutter Package

The `drawing_animation` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create engaging and visually appealing animations that simulate drawing effects. This package is particularly useful for applications that require dynamic illustrations, such as educational apps, art applications, or any app that benefits from animated graphics.

## When to Use This Package
- **Educational Apps**: To illustrate concepts through animated drawings.
- **Art Applications**: To create interactive art experiences.
- **Games**: For animations that enhance user engagement.

## Features
- **Customizable Animation Duration**: Control how fast or slow the drawing occurs.
- **Path Animation**: Animate any path defined by a `Path` object.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter's widget tree.
- **Support for Multiple Paths**: Animate multiple paths simultaneously.

This package allows developers to create stunning visual effects that can enhance user experience and engagement in their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Drawing Animation Package

## Installation
To use the `drawing_animation` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  drawing_animation: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your animations require any specific permissions (like accessing the camera or storage).

## Basic Usage
To use the `drawing_animation` package, you can create a simple widget that utilizes the `DrawingAnimation` class. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:drawing_animation/drawing_animation.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Drawing Animation Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: DrawingAnimation(
          path: Path()..moveTo(50, 50)..lineTo(200, 200),
          duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
          child: Container(
            width: 250,
            height: 250,
            color: Colors.transparent,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple drawing animation that animates a line from point (50, 50) to (200, 200) over 2 seconds. The `DrawingAnimation` widget takes a `Path` and a `duration` as parameters.

Now you are ready to create stunning animations in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of Drawing Animation

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:drawing_animation/drawing_animation.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Drawing Animation Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Drawing Animation Example')),
      body: Center(
        // The DrawingAnimation widget is used to create the drawing effect
        child: DrawingAnimation(
          // Define the path to be animated
          path: Path()
            ..moveTo(50, 50) // Start point of the line
            ..lineTo(200, 200) // End point of the line
            ..lineTo(100, 100) // Adding another line to create a triangle
            ..close(), // Close the path to form a triangle
          duration: Duration(seconds: 3), // Duration of the animation
          child: Container(
            width: 250, // Width of the container
            height: 250, // Height of the container
            color: Colors.transparent, // Make the container transparent
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a DrawingAnimation widget is created.
// 5. The DrawingAnimation widget takes a Path that defines a triangle and animates it over 3 seconds.
// 6. The child of the DrawingAnimation is a transparent Container that defines the area for the animation.
