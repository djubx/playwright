# Flutter Conditional Rendering Package: flutter_conditional_rendering

The `flutter_conditional_rendering` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of rendering widgets conditionally based on specific criteria. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to display different UI elements based on user input, application state, or any other dynamic conditions.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using `flutter_conditional_rendering` in the following scenarios:

- **User Authentication**: Display different screens or widgets based on whether a user is logged in or not.
- **Feature Flags**: Show or hide features based on user roles or permissions.
- **Dynamic Content**: Render different layouts based on data fetched from an API.

## Key Features

- **Simple Syntax**: The package provides an intuitive API for conditional rendering.
- **Flexible Conditions**: You can use various conditions to determine which widget to display.
- **Performance Optimizations**: The package is designed to minimize unnecessary rebuilds, enhancing performance.

In summary, `flutter_conditional_rendering` is an essential package for any Flutter developer looking to implement dynamic UI rendering efficiently.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_conditional_rendering

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_conditional_rendering` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_conditional_rendering: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use `flutter_conditional_rendering` to display different widgets based on a boolean condition.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_conditional_rendering/flutter_conditional_rendering.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    bool isLoggedIn = true; // Change this to false to see the other widget

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Conditional Rendering Example')),
        body: Conditional.single(
          context: context,
          conditionBuilder: (context) => isLoggedIn,
          widgetBuilder: (context) => Center(child: Text('Welcome Back!')),
          fallbackBuilder: (context) => Center(child: Text('Please Log In')),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, the `Conditional.single` widget checks the `isLoggedIn` variable. If it's true, it displays a welcome message; otherwise, it prompts the user to log in.

# Complete Example of flutter_conditional_rendering

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_conditional_rendering/flutter_conditional_rendering.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // This boolean variable determines the user's login status
    bool isLoggedIn = true; // Change this to false to see the fallback widget

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Conditional Rendering Example')),
        body: Conditional.single(
          context: context,
          // The condition to check if the user is logged in
          conditionBuilder: (context) => isLoggedIn,
          // Widget to display if the condition is true
          widgetBuilder: (context) => Center(child: Text('Welcome Back!')),
          // Widget to display if the condition is false
          fallbackBuilder: (context) => Center(child: Text('Please Log In')),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // The entry point of the application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. Inside the RealFlutter widget, we define a boolean variable 'isLoggedIn' to simulate the user's login status.
// 3. The Conditional.single widget checks the 'isLoggedIn' variable.
// 4. If 'isLoggedIn' is true, it displays "Welcome Back!" in the center of the screen.
// 5. If 'isLoggedIn' is false, it displays "Please Log In" instead.
// 6. This allows for dynamic rendering of widgets based on the user's authentication state.
