## Setup Process

To use the `url_launcher` package in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `url_launcher` dependency.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     url_launcher: ^6.0.20  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

     ```xml
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
     ```

   - **iOS**: For iOS, you need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

     ```xml
     <key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
     <array>
       <string>http</string>
       <string>https</string>
       <string>mailto</string>
       <string>tel</string>
     </array>
     ```

## Using the Package

To use the `url_launcher` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';
```

### Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the package to launch different types of URLs:

- **Open a Web Page**:

  ```dart
  void _launchURL() async {
    const url = 'https://flutter.dev';
    if (await canLaunch(url)) {
      await launch(url);
    } else {
      throw 'Could not launch $url';
    }
  }
  ```

- **Dial a Phone Number**:

  ```dart
  void _launchDialer() async {
    const phoneNumber = 'tel:+1234567890';
    if (await canLaunch(phoneNumber)) {
      await launch(phoneNumber);
    } else {
      throw 'Could not launch $phoneNumber';
    }
  }
  ```

- **Send an Email**:

  ```dart
  void _launchEmail() async {
    const email = 'mailto:example@example.com?subject=Hello&body=How are you?';
    if (await canLaunch(email)) {
      await launch(email);
    } else {
      throw 'Could not launch $email';
    }
  }
  ```

By following these steps, you can easily integrate the `url_launcher` package into your Flutter application and enhance its functionality.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'URL Launcher Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('URL Launcher Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _launchURL, // Launches a web page
                child: Text('Open Flutter Website'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _launchDialer, // Launches the dialer
                child: Text('Call +1234567890'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _launchEmail, // Launches the email client
                child: Text('Send Email'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to launch a web page
  void _launchURL() async {
    const url = 'https://flutter.dev'; // URL to be launched
    if (await canLaunch(url)) { // Check if the URL can be launched
      await launch(url); // Launch the URL
    } else {
      throw 'Could not launch $url'; // Error handling
    }
  }

  // Function to launch the dialer
  void _launchDialer() async {
    const phoneNumber = 'tel:+1234567890'; // Phone number to dial
    if (await canLaunch(phoneNumber)) { // Check if the phone number can be launched
      await launch(phoneNumber); // Launch the dialer
    } else {
      throw 'Could not launch $phoneNumber'; // Error handling
    }
  }

  // Function to launch the email client
  void _launchEmail() async {
    const email = 'mailto:example@example.com?subject=Hello&body=How are you?'; // Email details
    if (await canLaunch(email)) { // Check if the email can be launched
      await launch(email); // Launch the email client
    } else {
      throw 'Could not launch $email'; // Error handling
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with a Column of buttons.
// 4. Each button is linked to a function that launches a specific type of URL:
//    - The first button opens the Flutter website.
//    - The second button initiates a phone call to the specified number.
//    - The third button opens the email client with pre-filled details.
// 5. Each function checks if the URL can be launched and handles errors appropriately.
```
