**Setting Up Stark**
-------------------

To use Stark in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1.  Add the Stark package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

    ```yml
dependencies:
  stark: ^1.0.0
```

2.  Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3.  Import the Stark package in your Dart file:

    ```dart
import 'package:stark/stark.dart';
```

**Using Stark Widgets**
----------------------

Stark provides a range of pre-built widgets that you can use to build your UI components. Here's an example of how to use the `StarkContainer` widget:

```dart
StarkContainer(
  child: Text('Hello World'),
  backgroundColor: Colors.white,
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
)
```

**Platform-Specific Configurations**
-----------------------------------

Stark provides platform-specific configurations to optimize performance and behavior on different platforms.

*   Android: To enable hardware acceleration on Android, add the following code to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

    ```xml
<application
  ...
  android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
  ...
>
```

*   iOS: To enable Metal rendering on iOS, add the following code to your `Info.plist` file:

    ```xml
<key>UIRequiresFullScreen</key>
<true/>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stark/stark.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a StarkContainer with a white background and padding
    return StarkContainer(
      child: Text('Hello World'),
      backgroundColor: Colors.white,
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created and returned by the main function.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a StarkContainer with a white background and padding.
// 3. The StarkContainer widget is rendered on the screen with the text "Hello World".
// 4. The user interacts with the app, and the StarkContainer widget responds to gestures and events.
// 5. The app continues to run until the user closes it.

// Summary:
// This code demonstrates how to use the Stark Flutter package to build a simple UI component.
// The RealFlutter widget creates a StarkContainer with a white background and padding, and renders it on the screen.
// The app responds to user interactions and continues to run until the user closes it.
