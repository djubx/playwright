# Hand Signature Flutter Package

The **hand_signature** Flutter package is a powerful tool for capturing handwritten signatures in Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where user authentication or agreement is required, such as in legal documents, contracts, or any application that requires a signature for verification.

## When to Use This Package
- **Legal Applications**: Capture signatures for contracts or agreements.
- **Forms**: Allow users to sign forms digitally.
- **E-commerce**: Confirm delivery or acceptance of goods with a signature.
- **Healthcare**: Capture patient consent or acknowledgment.

## Features
- **Customizable Signature Area**: You can define the size and appearance of the signature area.
- **Clear and Save Options**: Users can clear their signature and save it as an image.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and usage within your Flutter application.

The **hand_signature** package provides a straightforward API that allows developers to integrate signature capture functionality seamlessly into their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Hand Signature Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To use the **hand_signature** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hand_signature: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` in your `Info.plist` file to allow saving signatures:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save your signature.</string>
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:hand_signature/hand_signature.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package
You can now use the `HandSignature` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it.

# Complete Example of Hand Signature Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hand_signature/hand_signature.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Hand Signature Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: SignatureScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class SignatureScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SignatureScreenState createState() => _SignatureScreenState();
}

class _SignatureScreenState extends State<SignatureScreen> {
  // Create a GlobalKey to manage the signature widget
  final GlobalKey<HandSignatureState> _signatureKey = GlobalKey<HandSignatureState>();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Hand Signature Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Signature widget
          HandSignature(
            key: _signatureKey,
            background: Colors.grey[200]!, // Background color of the signature area
            strokeWidth: 2.0, // Width of the signature stroke
            onChanged: (data) {
              // Handle signature change
            },
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          Row(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Clear the signature
                  _signatureKey.currentState?.clear();
                },
                child: Text('Clear'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  // Save the signature as an image
                  final signature = await _signatureKey.currentState?.getData();
                  // Handle the saved signature (e.g., upload or display)
                },
                child: Text('Save'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home screen as SignatureScreen.
// 3. In SignatureScreen, a HandSignature widget is created to capture the user's signature.
// 4. The signature area has a clear button to reset the signature and a save button to save the signature as an image.
// 5. The clear button calls the clear method on the HandSignature widget to reset the signature area.
// 6. The save button retrieves the signature data and can be used to upload or display the signature as needed.
```
