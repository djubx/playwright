# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Country Calling Code Picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `country_calling_code_picker` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `country_calling_code_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  country_calling_code_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for network requests if your app requires it. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that the package is set up, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the country calling code picker.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_calling_code_picker/country_calling_code_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Country Calling Code Picker')),
        body: Center(
          child: CountryCallingCodePicker(
            onChanged: (countryCode) {
              // Handle the selected country code
              print('Selected country code: ${countryCode.dialCode}');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays the country calling code picker. When a user selects a country, the selected country code is printed to the console.

# Complete Example of Country Calling Code Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_calling_code_picker/country_calling_code_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Country Calling Code Picker')),
        body: Center(
          child: CountryCallingCodePicker(
            onChanged: (countryCode) {
              // This callback is triggered when a country is selected
              print('Selected country code: ${countryCode.dialCode}');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, we place the CountryCallingCodePicker.
// 4. When the user selects a country from the picker, the onChanged callback is triggered.
// 5. The selected country code is printed to the console, allowing you to use it as needed in your application.
