# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using f_datetimerangepicker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `f_datetimerangepicker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  f_datetimerangepicker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing the device's calendar or reminders. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your calendar.</string>
<key>NSRemindersUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your reminders.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the date and time range picker.

# Complete Example of f_datetimerangepicker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:f_datetimerangepicker/f_datetimerangepicker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'DateTime Range Picker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DateTimeRangePickerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class DateTimeRangePickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DateTimeRangePickerDemoState createState() => _DateTimeRangePickerDemoState();
}

class _DateTimeRangePickerDemoState extends State<DateTimeRangePickerDemo> {
  DateTimeRange? _selectedDateTimeRange; // Variable to hold the selected date range

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('DateTime Range Picker'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected date range
            Text(
              _selectedDateTimeRange == null
                  ? 'No date range selected'
                  : 'Selected: ${_selectedDateTimeRange!.start} - ${_selectedDateTimeRange!.end}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Show the date range picker when the button is pressed
                final DateTimeRange? picked = await showDateTimeRangePicker(
                  context: context,
                  initialDateRange: _selectedDateTimeRange,
                  firstDate: DateTime.now(),
                  lastDate: DateTime(2101),
                );

                // Update the state with the selected date range
                if (picked != null && picked != _selectedDateTimeRange) {
                  setState(() {
                    _selectedDateTimeRange = picked;
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Select Date Range'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is DateTimeRangePickerDemo, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. Inside DateTimeRangePickerDemo, we define a variable _selectedDateTimeRange to hold the selected date range.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 6. The Column displays the selected date range or a message if none is selected.
// 7. An ElevatedButton is provided to trigger the date range picker.
// 8. When the button is pressed, the showDateTimeRangePicker function is called, allowing the user to select a date range.
// 9. If a date range is selected, the state is updated, and the UI reflects the new selection.
```
