# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Clip Shadow X

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `clip_shadowx` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  clip_shadowx: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Android

Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### For iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:clip_shadowx/clip_shadowx.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using ClipShadowX

You can now use the `ClipShadowX` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
ClipShadowX(
  clipShape: BoxShape.rectangle, // Choose your shape
  shadow: Shadow(                 // Customize your shadow
    color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5),
    blurRadius: 10.0,
    offset: Offset(5.0, 5.0),
  ),
  child: Container(
    height: 100,
    width: 100,
    color: Colors.blue,
  ),
);
```

This code snippet creates a rectangular container with a shadow effect. You can customize the `clipShape`, `shadow`, and child widget as per your design requirements.

# Complete Example of Using Clip Shadow X

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:clip_shadowx/clip_shadowx.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Clip Shadow X Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Clip Shadow X Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ClipShadowX(
            clipShape: BoxShape.rectangle, // Define the shape of the clip
            shadow: Shadow(                 // Define the shadow properties
              color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5), // Shadow color
              blurRadius: 10.0,            // Blur radius of the shadow
              offset: Offset(5.0, 5.0),    // Offset of the shadow
            ),
            child: Container(
              height: 200,                 // Height of the container
              width: 200,                  // Width of the container
              color: Colors.blue,          // Background color of the container
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Hello, Clip Shadow X!', // Text inside the container
                  style: TextStyle(
                    color: Colors.white,    // Text color
                    fontSize: 20,           // Text size
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we use ClipShadowX to create a rectangular clip with a shadow.
// 5. The shadow is defined with a color, blur radius, and offset.
// 6. The child of ClipShadowX is a Container with a blue background and centered text.
// 7. The text "Hello, Clip Shadow X!" is displayed in white color, showcasing the shadow effect.
