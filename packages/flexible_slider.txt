# Flexible Slider: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To add the **flexible_slider** package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flexible_slider: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flexible_slider).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if your slider interacts with device features. However, for basic usage, no additional configuration is required.

## Basic Usage
To use the **flexible_slider** in your Flutter application, you can follow this simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flexible_slider/flexible_slider.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flexible Slider Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FlexibleSlider(
            min: 0,
            max: 100,
            value: 50,
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Handle value change
              print('Slider value: $value');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a slider that ranges from 0 to 100. The `onChanged` callback is triggered whenever the slider value changes, allowing you to handle the new value accordingly.

With this setup, you can start integrating the **flexible_slider** into your Flutter applications seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Flexible Slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flexible_slider/flexible_slider.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _sliderValue = 50; // Initial value for the slider

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flexible Slider Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Display the current value of the slider
              Text('Current Value: ${_sliderValue.toStringAsFixed(1)}'),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some spacing
              FlexibleSlider(
                min: 0, // Minimum value of the slider
                max: 100, // Maximum value of the slider
                value: _sliderValue, // Current value of the slider
                onChanged: (value) {
                  // Update the state with the new slider value
                  setState(() {
                    _sliderValue = value; // Update the slider value
                  });
                },
                activeColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the active part of the slider
                inactiveColor: Colors.grey, // Color of the inactive part of the slider
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

```dart
// The above code creates a Flutter application with a flexible slider.
// 1. We define a StatefulWidget called RealFlutter to manage the slider's state.
// 2. The _sliderValue variable holds the current value of the slider, initialized to 50.
// 3. In the build method, we create a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we use a Column to arrange the Text and FlexibleSlider vertically.
// 5. The Text widget displays the current value of the slider, formatted to one decimal place.
// 6. The FlexibleSlider is configured with a range from 0 to 100, and its value is bound to _sliderValue.
// 7. The onChanged callback updates the _sliderValue state whenever the slider is moved, triggering a rebuild of the widget.
// 8. The active and inactive colors of the slider are set to enhance the visual appearance.
// 9. Finally, the main function runs the RealFlutter app, displaying the slider and its current value to the user.
