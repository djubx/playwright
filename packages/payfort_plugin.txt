# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using payfort_plugin

## Installation
To get started with the `payfort_plugin`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  payfort_plugin: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/payfort_plugin).

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Android Configuration
1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="payfort_sdk_key"
            android:value="YOUR_PAYFORT_SDK_KEY"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `android/build.gradle` file includes the required repositories:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the necessary permissions in your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed and run `pod install` in the `ios` directory.

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to initiate a payment:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:payfort_plugin/payfort_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PayFort Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Start the payment process
              PayFortPlugin.startPayment(
                amount: 100.0,
                currency: 'AED',
                merchantId: 'YOUR_MERCHANT_ID',
                onSuccess: (response) {
                  // Handle successful payment
                  print('Payment Successful: $response');
                },
                onFailure: (error) {
                  // Handle payment failure
                  print('Payment Failed: $error');
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application with a button that initiates a payment when pressed. The `startPayment` method takes parameters such as the amount, currency, and merchant ID, and provides callbacks for success and failure responses.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:payfort_plugin/payfort_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PayFort Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Start the payment process
              PayFortPlugin.startPayment(
                amount: 100.0, // Amount to be charged
                currency: 'AED', // Currency code
                merchantId: 'YOUR_MERCHANT_ID', // Your PayFort merchant ID
                onSuccess: (response) {
                  // Handle successful payment
                  print('Payment Successful: $response');
                },
                onFailure: (error) {
                  // Handle payment failure
                  print('Payment Failed: $error');
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. A Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is displayed.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the startPayment method from the payfort_plugin is called.
// 5. The payment amount, currency, and merchant ID are passed as parameters.
// 6. The onSuccess callback handles successful payments, while the onFailure callback handles any errors.
// 7. The app prints the payment response to the console for debugging purposes.
