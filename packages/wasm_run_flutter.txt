<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# wasm_run_flutter Package Overview

The `wasm_run_flutter` package is a powerful tool that allows Flutter developers to run WebAssembly (Wasm) modules within their Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for scenarios where performance is critical, such as in gaming, image processing, or any computationally intensive tasks. By leveraging Wasm, developers can execute code written in languages like C, C++, or Rust, providing a significant performance boost compared to traditional Dart code.

## When to Use `wasm_run_flutter`

- **Performance-Critical Applications**: If your Flutter app requires high-performance computations, using Wasm can significantly speed up processing times.
- **Reusing Existing Code**: If you have existing libraries written in C/C++ or Rust, you can compile them to Wasm and use them in your Flutter app without rewriting them in Dart.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Wasm modules can run in any environment that supports Wasm, making it easier to maintain a single codebase across different platforms.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: The package provides a straightforward API to load and run Wasm modules.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Performance Optimization**: Leverages the speed of native code execution through Wasm.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using wasm_run_flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `wasm_run_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `wasm_run_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wasm_run_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. **Update Android Manifest**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` includes the necessary permissions and configurations. You may need to add internet permissions if your Wasm module requires network access.

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Make sure your `build.gradle` file is set up to support the required SDK versions.

### iOS

1. **Update Info.plist**: Similar to Android, ensure that your `Info.plist` file has the necessary permissions.

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure that your Podfile is updated to use the latest iOS version.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to load and run a Wasm module.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wasm_run_flutter/wasm_run_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Wasm Run Flutter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Wasm Run Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder(
            future: _loadAndRunWasm(),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                return Text('Result: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<String> _loadAndRunWasm() async {
    // Load the Wasm module
    final wasmModule = await WasmRunFlutter.load('assets/my_module.wasm');
    
    // Run a function from the Wasm module
    final result = await wasmModule.call('myFunction', [42]);
    
    return result.toString();
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of wasm_run_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wasm_run_flutter/wasm_run_flutter.dart';

// Main entry point of the Flutter application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The main widget of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Wasm Run Flutter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Wasm Run Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder(
            // Call the async function to load and run the Wasm module
            future: _loadAndRunWasm(),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              // Show a loading indicator while waiting for the result
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                // Display an error message if something went wrong
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                // Display the result from the Wasm module
                return Text('Result: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to load and run the Wasm module
  Future<String> _loadAndRunWasm() async {
    // Load the Wasm module from the assets
    final wasmModule = await WasmRunFlutter.load('assets/my_module.wasm');
    
    // Call a function named 'myFunction' from the Wasm module with an argument
    final result = await wasmModule.call('myFunction', [42]);
    
    // Return the result as a string
    return result.toString();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a FutureBuilder is used to handle the asynchronous loading of the Wasm module.
// 4. The _loadAndRunWasm() function is called, which loads the Wasm module and calls a function from it.
// 5. While waiting for the result, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 6. If the Wasm module loads successfully, the result is displayed; otherwise, an error message is shown.
```

In summary, the `wasm_run_flutter` package provides a robust solution for integrating WebAssembly into Flutter applications, enabling high-performance computing and code reuse. The example above demonstrates how to set up the package, load a Wasm module, and call a function from it, showcasing the ease of use and efficiency of this powerful tool.
