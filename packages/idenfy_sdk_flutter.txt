# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using idenfy_sdk_flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `idenfy_sdk_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `idenfy_sdk_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  idenfy_sdk_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Enable ProGuard**: If you are using ProGuard, ensure that you add the necessary rules to keep the Identy SDK classes.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera for identity verification.</string>
   ```

2. **Enable Background Modes**: If your app requires background processing, enable the appropriate background modes in Xcode.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:idenfy_sdk_flutter/idenfy_sdk_flutter.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize the SDK**:

   You need to initialize the SDK with your API key. This is typically done in the `main` function or the first screen of your app.

   ```dart
   void main() {
     runApp(MyApp());
     IdentySdkFlutter.initialize(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');
   }
   ```

3. **Start the Verification Process**:

   You can start the verification process by calling the appropriate method from the SDK. Hereâ€™s an example of how to initiate the verification:

   ```dart
   void startVerification() async {
     final result = await IdentySdkFlutter.startVerification();
     // Handle the result of the verification
   }
   ```

4. **Handle the Verification Result**:

   After the verification process, you will receive a result that you can use to determine the next steps in your application.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the `idenfy_sdk_flutter` package into your Flutter application, enabling secure identity verification features.

# Complete Example of Using idenfy_sdk_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:idenfy_sdk_flutter/idenfy_sdk_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  // Initialize the Identy SDK with your API key
  IdentySdkFlutter.initialize(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Idenfy SDK Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Idenfy SDK Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Start the verification process when the button is pressed
            startVerification(context);
          },
          child: Text('Start Verification'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void startVerification(BuildContext context) async {
    // Call the startVerification method from the Identy SDK
    final result = await IdentySdkFlutter.startVerification();

    // Check the result of the verification
    if (result.isSuccessful) {
      // If successful, show a success message
      showDialog(
        context: context,
        builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
          title: Text('Verification Successful'),
          content: Text('User identity has been verified.'),
          actions: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
              child: Text('OK'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      );
    } else {
      // If failed, show an error message
      showDialog(
        context: context,
        builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
          title: Text('Verification Failed'),
          content: Text('Error: ${result.errorMessage}'),
          actions: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
              child: Text('OK'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      );
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the Identy SDK with the provided API key.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, featuring a button to start the verification process.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the startVerification method is called.
// 4. The startVerification method invokes the Identy SDK's verification process.
// 5. Based on the result of the verification, a dialog is shown to inform the user of success or failure.
```
