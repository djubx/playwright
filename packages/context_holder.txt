Here's a detailed technical blog on the "context_holder" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Context Holder Flutter Package

The **context_holder** package is a powerful tool for managing and sharing context across your Flutter application. It allows developers to store and retrieve context-related data efficiently, making it easier to manage state and dependencies in a clean and organized manner.

## When to Use Context Holder

You might consider using the **context_holder** package in scenarios such as:

- **State Management**: When you need to share state across multiple widgets without relying on inherited widgets or provider patterns.
- **Dependency Injection**: To manage dependencies in a more structured way, allowing for easier testing and maintenance.
- **Global Access**: When you want to access certain data or services globally without passing them down through the widget tree.

## Features

- **Easy Context Management**: Simplifies the process of managing context in your Flutter app.
- **Scoped Context**: Allows you to define context scopes, making it easier to manage different parts of your application.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, ensuring that your app remains performant.

By leveraging the **context_holder** package, you can create more maintainable and scalable Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Context Holder

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **context_holder** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  context_holder: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Context Holder

To use the **context_holder** package, you need to create a context holder and define the data you want to manage. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:context_holder/context_holder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ContextHolder(
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Setting a value in the context holder
    context.holder.set('username', 'JohnDoe');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Context Holder Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Retrieving the value from the context holder
            final username = context.holder.get('username');
            print('Username: $username'); // Output: Username: JohnDoe
          },
          child: Text('Get Username'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that uses the **context_holder** package to store and retrieve a username.

# Complete Example of Context Holder

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:context_holder/context_holder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Wrapping the app with ContextHolder to manage context
    return ContextHolder(
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Context Holder Demo',
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Setting a value in the context holder
    context.holder.set('username', 'JohnDoe');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Context Holder Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Retrieving the value from the context holder
            final username = context.holder.get('username');
            // Printing the retrieved username to the console
            print('Username: $username'); // Output: Username: JohnDoe
          },
          child: Text('Get Username'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that wraps the MaterialApp with ContextHolder.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is set as the home of the MaterialApp.
// 4. In HomeScreen, we set a value ('JohnDoe') in the context holder using context.holder.set().
// 5. When the button is pressed, we retrieve the username from the context holder using context.holder.get().
// 6. The retrieved username is printed to the console, demonstrating how to access data stored in the context holder.
