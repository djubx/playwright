# Flutter IoC Package: A Dependency Injection Solution
=====================================================

The `flutter_ioc` package is a lightweight, easy-to-use dependency injection solution for Flutter applications. It allows you to manage dependencies between objects and provides a simple way to swap out implementations for testing or different environments.

## When to Use This Package

This package is ideal for applications that require a high degree of modularity, scalability, and testability. It's perfect for projects that involve multiple developers, complex business logic, or a large number of features.

## Features

*   **Dependency Injection**: Provides a simple way to inject dependencies into objects.
*   **Modular Design**: Encourages modular design by allowing you to break down your application into smaller, independent components.
*   **Testability**: Makes it easy to write unit tests by providing a simple way to swap out dependencies.
*   **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Allows you to configure your application for different environments (e.g., development, production).

# Setting Up and Using the Flutter IoC Package
=============================================

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the `flutter_ioc` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_ioc: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Create a Container

Create a container that will hold all of your dependencies. This is typically done in a separate file (e.g., `ioc_container.dart`):

```dart
import 'package:flutter_ioc/flutter_ioc.dart';

class IoCContainer {
  static final IoCContainer _instance = IoCContainer._();

  factory IoCContainer() => _instance;

  IoCContainer._() {
    // Register dependencies here
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Register Dependencies

Register your dependencies in the container:

```dart
class IoCContainer {
  // ...

  IoCContainer._() {
    // Register a dependency
    register<RealFlutter>(() => RealFlutter());
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Inject Dependencies

Inject dependencies into your objects:

```dart
class RealFlutter {
  final IoCContainer _container;

  RealFlutter(this._container);

  void doSomething() {
    // Use the injected dependency
  }
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_ioc/flutter_ioc.dart';

// Define the IoC container
class IoCContainer {
  static final IoCContainer _instance = IoCContainer._();

  factory IoCContainer() => _instance;

  IoCContainer._() {
    // Register dependencies here
    register<RealFlutter>(() => RealFlutter());
  }
}

// Define the RealFlutter class
class RealFlutter {
  void doSomething() {
    print('Doing something...');
  }
}

void main() {
  // Create the IoC container
  final container = IoCContainer();

  // Get the RealFlutter instance from the container
  final realFlutter = container.resolve<RealFlutter>();

  // Use the RealFlutter instance
  realFlutter.doSomething();

  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter IoC Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter IoC Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, World!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The IoC container is created and dependencies are registered.
// 2. The RealFlutter instance is resolved from the container.
// 3. The RealFlutter instance is used to perform some action.
// 4. The Flutter app is run with the MyApp widget.
// The IoC container provides a simple way to manage dependencies and swap out implementations for testing or different environments.
