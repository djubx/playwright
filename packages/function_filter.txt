# Overview of the function_filter Flutter Package

The `function_filter` package is a powerful utility for Flutter developers that allows for the filtering of lists based on specific criteria defined by functions. This package is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets where you need to display only a subset of data based on user-defined conditions. 

## When to Use This Package
- **Dynamic Filtering**: When you need to filter lists dynamically based on user input or other criteria.
- **Data Management**: In applications that manage large datasets, such as e-commerce apps, where users can filter products based on various attributes.
- **Search Functionality**: When implementing search features that require filtering of results in real-time.

## Key Features
- **Custom Filter Functions**: Allows developers to define their own filtering logic using functions.
- **Flexible Data Types**: Works with various data types, making it versatile for different applications.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Efficiently handles filtering operations to ensure smooth performance even with large datasets.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using function_filter

## Installation
To add the `function_filter` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  function_filter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
The `function_filter` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional configurations required for either platform, making it easy to integrate into your Flutter application.

## Basic Usage
To use the `function_filter` package, you will typically follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:function_filter/function_filter.dart';
   ```

2. Define your data model and create a list of items to filter.

3. Use the `filter` method provided by the package to filter your list based on custom criteria.

### Example Code Snippet
```dart
List<String> items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date'];
List<String> filteredItems = items.filter((item) => item.startsWith('A'));
```

This example filters the list to include only items that start with the letter 'A'.

# Complete Example of function_filter in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:function_filter/function_filter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Function Filter Example',
      home: FilterExample(),
    );
  }
}

class FilterExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FilterExampleState createState() => _FilterExampleState();
}

class _FilterExampleState extends State<FilterExample> {
  // List of items to filter
  List<String> items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Avocado', 'Blueberry'];
  // This will hold the filtered results
  List<String> filteredItems = [];

  // This function filters the items based on the input
  void filterItems(String query) {
    // Using the filter method from the function_filter package
    filteredItems = items.filter((item) => item.toLowerCase().contains(query.toLowerCase()));
    // Trigger a rebuild to update the UI
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initially, all items are displayed
    filteredItems = items;
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Function Filter Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // TextField for user input
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
            child: TextField(
              onChanged: filterItems, // Call filterItems on text change
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Search',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
          ),
          // Displaying the filtered items
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: filteredItems.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(filteredItems[index]), // Display each filtered item
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home screen as FilterExample.
// The FilterExample widget maintains a list of items and a filtered list.
// The filterItems function is called whenever the user types in the TextField.
// It filters the items based on the input and updates the filteredItems list.
// The UI is rebuilt to display the filtered results in a ListView.
