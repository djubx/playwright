# Setting Up and Using the flame_lint Package

## Installation
To get started with `flame_lint`, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flame_lint: ^latest_version
```

Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_lint).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Configuration
Once installed, you need to configure `flame_lint` to use the linting rules that suit your project. Create a file named `analysis_options.yaml` in the root of your project and add the following configuration:

```yaml
include: package:flame_lint/analysis_options.yaml
```

This will include the default linting rules provided by `flame_lint`.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file to avoid compatibility issues.

### iOS
For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter features.

## Running Lint Checks
To run the lint checks, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

This command will analyze your code and provide feedback based on the linting rules defined in your `analysis_options.yaml` file.

By following these steps, you can effectively set up and start using the `flame_lint` package in your Flutter projects.

# Complete Example of Using flame_lint

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The main widget of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flame Lint Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// Home page widget
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flame Lint Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to Flame Lint!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (BuildContext context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Hello!'),
                      content: Text('This is a linting example.'),
                      actions: <Widget>[
                        TextButton(
                          child: Text('Close'),
                          onPressed: () {
                            Navigator.of(context).pop();
                          },
                        ),
                      ],
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Show Dialog'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to MyHomePage, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. MyHomePage contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget that holds a Column.
// 5. The Column displays a welcome message and an ElevatedButton.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it triggers a dialog to show up, demonstrating user interaction.
// 7. The dialog can be closed by pressing the 'Close' button, which pops the dialog off the stack.
