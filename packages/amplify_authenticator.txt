# Tutorial: Setting Up amplify_authenticator in Your Flutter App

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `amplify_authenticator` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, you need to add the `amplify_authenticator` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. You also need to include the `amplify_flutter` and `amplify_auth_cognito` packages for authentication.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  amplify_flutter: ^0.2.0
  amplify_auth_cognito: ^0.2.0
  amplify_authenticator: ^0.2.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependencies.

## Step 2: Configure AWS Amplify

Before using the `amplify_authenticator`, you need to configure AWS Amplify in your project. This involves setting up an AWS account and creating a Cognito User Pool.

1. **Create an AWS Account**: If you donâ€™t have one, sign up at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
2. **Set Up Cognito User Pool**:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to Amazon Cognito and create a new User Pool.
   - Configure the pool settings, including sign-in options and security policies.
   - After creating the pool, note down the User Pool ID and App Client ID.

3. **Configure Amplify**: Create a new file named `amplifyconfiguration.json` in your `assets` folder and add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "plugins": {
      "awsCognitoAuthPlugin": {
        "UserPoolId": "YOUR_USER_POOL_ID",
        "AppClientId": "YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID",
        "Region": "YOUR_AWS_REGION"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_USER_POOL_ID`, `YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID`, and `YOUR_AWS_REGION` with your actual values.

## Step 3: Initialize Amplify in Your App

In your `main.dart` file, initialize Amplify and configure the authenticator.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:amplify_flutter/amplify.dart';
import 'package:amplify_auth_cognito/amplify_auth_cognito.dart';
import 'package:amplify_authenticator/amplify_authenticator.dart';
import 'amplifyconfiguration.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Amplify Authenticator Demo',
      home: Authenticator(
        child: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _configureAmplify();
  }

  Future<void> _configureAmplify() async {
    final auth = AmplifyAuthCognito();
    await Amplify.addPlugin(auth);
    await Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!')),
    );
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android
- Ensure you have the correct permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

#### iOS
- For iOS, ensure you have the correct configurations in your `Info.plist` file. Add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Run Your Application

Now that everything is set up, you can run your application using `flutter run`. You should see the authentication UI provided by the `amplify_authenticator` package.

# Complete Example of amplify_authenticator in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:amplify_flutter/amplify.dart';
import 'package:amplify_auth_cognito/amplify_auth_cognito.dart';
import 'package:amplify_authenticator/amplify_authenticator.dart';
import 'amplifyconfiguration.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Amplify Authenticator Demo',
      home: Authenticator(
        child: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _configureAmplify(); // Initialize Amplify when the app starts
  }

  Future<void> _configureAmplify() async {
    // Create an instance of the Auth plugin
    final auth = AmplifyAuthCognito();
    // Add the Auth plugin to Amplify
    await Amplify.addPlugin(auth);
    // Configure Amplify with the configuration file
    await Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')), // App bar with title
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!'), // Main content
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with the Authenticator widget as the home.
// 3. The Authenticator widget provides the authentication UI.
// 4. HomeScreen is initialized, and in its initState, it calls _configureAmplify.
// 5. _configureAmplify initializes the Amplify Auth plugin and configures it with the provided settings.
// 6. The HomeScreen displays a welcome message once the user is authenticated.
```
