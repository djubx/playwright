# Setting Up and Using the "file_manager" Package

## Installation
To get started with the `file_manager` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  file_manager: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/file_manager).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read and write files. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/`:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to manage files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to manage files.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured the necessary permissions, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `file_manager` package to list files in a directory:

```dart
import 'package:file_manager/file_manager.dart';

void listFiles() async {
  // Specify the directory you want to access
  String directoryPath = '/storage/emulated/0/Download';
  
  // Get the list of files in the directory
  List<FileSystemEntity> files = await FileManager.listFiles(directoryPath);
  
  // Print the names of the files
  for (var file in files) {
    print(file.path);
  }
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to list files in the specified directory. You can expand upon this by adding more functionalities such as creating or deleting files.

With the setup complete and basic usage understood, you are now ready to implement more complex file management features in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the "file_manager" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:file_manager/file_manager.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'File Manager Example',
      home: FileManagerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FileManagerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FileManagerScreenState createState() => _FileManagerScreenState();
}

class _FileManagerScreenState extends State<FileManagerScreen> {
  List<FileSystemEntity> _files = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _loadFiles(); // Load files when the screen initializes
  }

  // Function to load files from a specific directory
  void _loadFiles() async {
    String directoryPath = '/storage/emulated/0/Download'; // Specify the directory
    List<FileSystemEntity> files = await FileManager.listFiles(directoryPath); // List files
    setState(() {
      _files = files; // Update the state with the list of files
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('File Manager'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: _files.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(_files[index].path.split('/').last), // Display file name
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (FileManagerScreen).
// 3. FileManagerScreen is a stateful widget that manages the list of files.
// 4. In the initState method, _loadFiles is called to fetch files from the specified directory.
// 5. _loadFiles uses FileManager.listFiles to get the files and updates the state.
// 6. The build method creates a ListView to display the file names.
// 7. Each file is displayed as a ListTile, showing just the file name extracted from the full path.
