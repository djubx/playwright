# Overview of the `file_manager` Flutter Package

The `file_manager` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify file management tasks within Flutter applications. It provides a comprehensive API for accessing, organizing, and manipulating files and directories on both Android and iOS platforms. This package is particularly useful for applications that require extensive file handling capabilities, such as document editors, media players, or file explorers.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Seamlessly works on both Android and iOS.
- **File Operations**: Perform operations like create, read, write, delete, and move files.
- **Directory Management**: Navigate through directories, create new directories, and list contents.
- **File Metadata**: Access file properties such as size, creation date, and modification date.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: All file operations are asynchronous, ensuring smooth UI performance.

## When to Use
- **Document Management Apps**: For apps that need to manage user documents.
- **Media Applications**: To handle media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
- **File Explorer Apps**: To provide users with a file browsing experience.

The `file_manager` package is an essential tool for developers looking to integrate robust file management capabilities into their Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the `file_manager` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `file_manager` package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency
Add the `file_manager` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  file_manager: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android
Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` includes the necessary permissions for file access:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

#### iOS
For iOS, update your `Info.plist` to request permission for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to manage files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents folder to manage files.</string>
```

## Using the Package

### Basic File Operations
To perform basic file operations, you can use the `RealFlutter` class provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import ' class RealFlutter {
  final fileManager = FileManager();

  Future<void> createFile(String path, String content) async {
    final file = await fileManager.createFile(path);
    await file.writeAsString(content);
  }

  Future<String> readFile(String path) async {
    final file = await fileManager.getFile(path);
    return await file.readAsString();
  }

  Future<void> deleteFile(String path) async {
    final file = await fileManager.getFile(path);
    await file.delete();
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create, read, and delete files using the `RealFlutter` class.

# Complete Example: Flutter Application Using `file_manager`

Below is a complete Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the `file_manager` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:file_manager/file_manager.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'File Manager Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,,
      ),
,
      home and the file_manager package. The app allows users to create, read, and delete files within the app's directory. The main class, RealFlutter, handles all file operations asynchronously to ensure smooth UI performance. The app's UI is built using Flutter's Material components, providing a simple interface for file management tasks.
