# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_animated_progress_bar

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_animated_progress_bar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_animated_progress_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the animated progress bar.

# Complete Example of flutter_animated_progress_bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_animated_progress_bar/flutter_animated_progress_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the progress value
  double progress = 0.0;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start the progress simulation
    simulateProgress();
  }

  // Function to simulate progress over time
  void simulateProgress() {
    // Use a timer to update the progress value
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () {
      if (progress < 1.0) {
        setState(() {
          progress += 0.1; // Increment progress by 10%
        });
        simulateProgress(); // Call the function recursively
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Progress Bar Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Animated progress bar widget
              AnimatedProgressBar(
                currentValue: progress,
                maxValue: 1.0,
                backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
                progressColor: Colors.blue,
                height: 20,
                animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display current progress percentage
              Text('${(progress * 100).toStringAsFixed(0)}%'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the progress value.
// 3. In the initState method, we call simulateProgress to start updating the progress value.
// 4. The simulateProgress function uses a Future.delayed to increment the progress value by 10% every second until it reaches 100%.
// 5. The build method returns a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, we have an AnimatedProgressBar that visually represents the progress value.
// 7. Below the progress bar, we display the current progress percentage as text.
// 8. The AnimatedProgressBar updates its appearance smoothly due to the animation duration specified.
```
