# License Generator Flutter Package

The `license_generator` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of generating license files for your Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for developers who need to comply with licensing requirements for third-party libraries and packages used in their projects. 

## When to Use This Package
You should consider using the `license_generator` package when:
- You are developing a Flutter application that incorporates third-party libraries and need to provide license information.
- You want to automate the generation of license files to save time and reduce manual errors.
- You need to ensure compliance with open-source licenses in your application.

## Features
- **Automatic License Extraction**: The package automatically extracts license information from the dependencies listed in your `pubspec.yaml` file.
- **Customizable Output**: You can customize the format and content of the generated license files.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

By leveraging the `license_generator` package, developers can ensure that they meet legal requirements while focusing on building their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the License Generator Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `license_generator` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  license_generator: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Configuring for Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

## Step 3: Configuring for iOS
For iOS, you may need to add specific configurations in your `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to generate a license file:

```dart
import 'package:license_generator/license_generator.dart';

void main() {
  LicenseGenerator.generateLicenses();
}
```

This code will generate a license file containing all the licenses of the dependencies used in your project.

## Step 5: Running the Application
To run your application, use the following command:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will execute the `main` function, and the license file will be generated in the specified output directory.

By following these steps, you can easily set up and use the `license_generator` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using the License Generator Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:license_generator/license_generator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'License Generator Example',
      home: LicenseHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class LicenseHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LicenseHomePageState createState() => _LicenseHomePageState();
}

class _LicenseHomePageState extends State<LicenseHomePage> {
  String _licenseContent = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _generateLicenses(); // Call the method to generate licenses on app start
  }

  void _generateLicenses() async {
    // Generate the licenses and store them in a variable
    String licenses = await LicenseGenerator.generateLicenses();
    setState(() {
      _licenseContent = licenses; // Update the state with the generated licenses
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('License Generator Example'),
      ),
      body: SingleChildScrollView(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Text(
          _licenseContent.isNotEmpty ? _licenseContent : 'Generating licenses...',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 14),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (LicenseHomePage).
// 3. LicenseHomePage is a stateful widget that manages the state of the license content.
// 4. In the initState method, _generateLicenses() is called to generate the license content when the app starts.
// 5. _generateLicenses() uses the LicenseGenerator to generate the licenses asynchronously.
// 6. Once the licenses are generated, the state is updated with the new content, triggering a rebuild of the widget.
// 7. The build method displays the generated licenses in a scrollable view, or a loading message if the licenses are still being generated.
