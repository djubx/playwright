```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_gradients_reborn: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the gradients in your Flutter application, you can import the package and apply the gradients to your widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use a gradient background in a `Container`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gradients_reborn/flutter_gradients_reborn.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Container(
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          gradient: Gradients.twitch, // Using a pre-defined gradient
        ),
        child: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Hello, Flutter Gradients!',
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to apply a pre-defined gradient to a `Container`. You can replace `Gradients.twitch` with any other gradient from the package.

# Complete Example of flutter_gradients_reborn

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gradients_reborn/flutter_gradients_reborn.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Gradients Reborn Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Gradients Example'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          // Applying a gradient background using the package
          decoration: BoxDecoration(
            gradient: Gradients.twitch, // Pre-defined gradient
          ),
          child: Center(
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: <Widget>[
                Text(
                  'Hello, Flutter Gradients!',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
                ),
                SizedBox(height: 20),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Action when button is pressed
                  },
                  child: Text('Press Me'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with RealFlutter as the root widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body is a Container that uses a gradient from the flutter_gradients_reborn package.
// 5. Inside the Container, a Center widget is used to center its child widgets.
// 6. The child is a Column that contains a Text widget and an ElevatedButton.
// 7. The Text widget displays a greeting message, and the button is set up for future actions.
