# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_google_places_web

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_google_places_web` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter web application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `flutter_google_places_web` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_google_places_web: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_google_places_web).

## Step 2: Obtain Google Places API Key

To use the Google Places API, you need to obtain an API key:
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Navigate to the "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" section.
4. Click on "Create credentials" and select "API key".
5. Enable the "Places API" for your project.

## Step 3: Configure Web App

In your Flutter web app, you need to configure the API key. Open the `index.html` file located in the `web` directory and add the following script tag within the `<head>` section:

```html
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&libraries=places"></script>
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the API key you obtained earlier.

## Step 4: Implement the Package

Now, let’s implement the `flutter_google_places_web` package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to use the package to create a place search feature.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_google_places_web/flutter_google_places_web.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Google Places Web Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Google Places Search'),
        ),
        body: PlaceSearchWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PlaceSearchWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PlaceSearchWidgetState createState() => _PlaceSearchWidgetState();
}

class _PlaceSearchWidgetState extends State<PlaceSearchWidget> {
  // Controller for the text field
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  String _placeName = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        // Text field for place search
        Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: TextField(
            controller: _controller,
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              hintText: 'Search for a place',
              suffixIcon: IconButton(
                icon: Icon(Icons.search),
                onPressed: () {
                  // Trigger the place search when the search icon is pressed
                  _searchPlace();
                },
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
        // Display the selected place name
        Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Text(
            _placeName.isNotEmpty ? 'Selected Place: $_placeName' : 'No Place Selected',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }

  // Function to search for a place
  void _searchPlace() async {
    // Use the Google Places API to get place predictions
    Prediction? prediction = await PlacesAutocomplete.show(
      context: context,
      apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY', // Replace with your API key
      mode: Mode.fullscreen, // Mode can be full screen or overlay
    );

    // If a prediction is selected, update the place name
    if (prediction != null) {
      setState(() {
        _placeName = prediction.description!;
      });
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold containing an AppBar and the PlaceSearchWidget.
// 3. PlaceSearchWidget is a stateful widget that contains a text field for searching places and a display area for the selected place.
// 4. When the user types in the text field and presses the search icon, the _searchPlace function is called.
// 5. _searchPlace uses the PlacesAutocomplete.show method to display a list of place predictions based on user input.
// 6. If the user selects a place, the place name is updated and displayed on the screen.
