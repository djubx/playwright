# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:single_child_two_dimensional_scroll_view/single_child_two_dimensional_scroll_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Two Dimensional Scroll View Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Two Dimensional Scroll View'),
        ),
        body: SingleChildTwoDimensionalScrollView(
          // Wrapping the content in the scroll view
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Creating a grid of items
              Row(
                children: List.generate(10, (index) {
                  return Container(
                    width: 100,
                    height: 100,
                    color: Colors.blue[(index % 9 + 1) * 100],
                    child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
                  );
                }),
              ),
              // Adding more rows to demonstrate vertical scrolling
              Row(
                children: List.generate(10, (index) {
                  return Container(
                    width: 100,
                    height: 100,
                    color: Colors.green[(index % 9 + 1) * 100],
                    child: Center(child: Text('Item ${index + 10}')),
                  );
                }),
              ),
              // Additional rows can be added here
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 4. The body of the scaffold contains a SingleChildTwoDimensionalScrollView.
// 5. Inside the scroll view, a Column widget is used to stack multiple rows of items.
// 6. Each Row contains a list of Containers, which represent the items in the grid.
// 7. The containers are colored differently and display their respective item numbers.
// 8. The user can scroll both horizontally and vertically to view all items in the grid.
```
