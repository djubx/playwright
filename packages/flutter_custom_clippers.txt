# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_custom_clippers

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `flutter_custom_clippers` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_custom_clippers: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_custom_clippers/flutter_custom_clippers.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Custom Clippers
You can now use the custom clippers in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the `DiagonalClipper`:

```dart
ClipPath(
  clipper: DiagonalClipper(),
  child: Container(
    height: 200,
    color: Colors.blue,
  ),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

### Optimizations
- Use `ClipPath` judiciously, as excessive clipping can lead to performance issues. Always test on real devices to ensure smooth performance.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate and use the `flutter_custom_clippers` package in your Flutter applications effectively.

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of a Column widget that holds three ClipPath widgets.
// 5. Each ClipPath uses a different custom clipper (DiagonalClipper, WaveClipperTwo, ArcClipper) to create unique shapes.
// 6. Each shape has a Container with a specific height and color, along with centered text.
// 7. The app showcases how to use different clippers to create visually appealing sections in a Flutter application.
