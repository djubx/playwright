# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Arabic Font Package

In this section, we'll walk through the process of setting up the `arabic_font` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

First, add the `arabic_font` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  arabic_font: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:arabic_font/arabic_font.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### Android Configuration

No additional configuration is required for Android. The package works out of the box.

### iOS Configuration

Ensure that your `Info.plist` file includes the necessary font files if you are using custom fonts not bundled with the package. Typically, the package handles this automatically, but custom fonts may require manual addition.

## Step 4: Implementing the Font

Use the `ArabicFont` class to apply fonts to your text widgets:

```dart
Text(
  'مرحبا بك في تطبيقنا',
  style: ArabicFont.dubai(
    fontSize: 20,
    fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
  ),
)
```

This example uses the Dubai font with a specified size and weight.

## Optimizations

- **Font Caching**: Ensure that fonts are cached to improve performance.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjust font sizes based on screen size to maintain readability.

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

Below is a complete example demonstrating how to use the `arabic_font` package in a Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:arabic_font/arabic_font.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// RealFlutter is the main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Arabic Font Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// HomePage is the main screen of the application
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Arabic Font Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying text with the Dubai font
            Text(
              'مرحبا بك في تطبيقنا',
              style: ArabicFont.dubai(
                fontSize: 24,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Displaying text with the Cairo font
            Text(
              'هذا مثال على استخدام الخطوط العربية',
              style: ArabicFont.cairo(
                fontSize: 20,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.normal,
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// Application Flow Explanation
// 1. The `main` function is the entry point of the application, which calls `runApp` with `RealFlutter`.
// 2. `RealFlutter` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The `HomePage` widget is the main screen, which is a stateless widget with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body with a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to layout text widgets vertically.
// 6. Each Text widget uses a different Arabic font from the `arabic_font` package, demonstrating the package's capabilities.
