# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Rate In Stars Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `rate_in_stars` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rate_in_stars: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the star rating widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rate_in_stars/rate_in_stars.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rate In Stars Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: StarRating(
            rating: 3.5, // Initial rating
            onRatingChanged: (rating) {
              // Handle the rating change
              print('New rating: $rating');
            },
            starCount: 5, // Total number of stars
            starSize: 40.0, // Size of each star
            color: Colors.amber, // Color of the stars
            borderColor: Colors.grey, // Border color of the stars
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a star rating widget in the center. The `StarRating` widget takes several parameters, including the initial rating, the number of stars, and their size and color.

# Complete Example of Rate In Stars

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rate_in_stars/rate_in_stars.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rate In Stars Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: StarRating(
            rating: 3.5, // Initial rating set to 3.5 stars
            onRatingChanged: (rating) {
              // Callback function to handle rating changes
              print('New rating: $rating'); // Print the new rating to the console
            },
            starCount: 5, // Total number of stars to display
            starSize: 40.0, // Size of each star
            color: Colors.amber, // Color of the filled stars
            borderColor: Colors.grey, // Color of the unfilled stars
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The StarRating widget is created with an initial rating of 3.5 stars.
// 6. When the user interacts with the stars, the onRatingChanged callback is triggered, printing the new rating to the console.
// 7. The starCount, starSize, color, and borderColor properties customize the appearance of the stars.
