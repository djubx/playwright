class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: SideMenu(
          items: [
            MenuItem(title: 'Home', icon: Icons.home),
            MenuItem(title: 'Profile', icon: Icons.person),
            MenuItem(title: 'Settings', icon: Icons.settings),
          ],
          onItemSelected: (item) {
            // Handle item selection
            print('Selected: ${item.title}');
          },
        ),

# Complete Example of flml_web_sidemenu

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flml_web_sidemenu/flml_web_sidemenu.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Web Side Menu Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Row(
          children: [
            // Create the side menu
            Expanded(
              flex: 1,
              child: SideMenu(
                items: [
                  MenuItem(title: 'Home', icon: Icons.home),
                  MenuItem(title: 'Profile', icon: Icons.person),
                  MenuItem(title: 'Settings', icon: Icons.settings),
                ],
                onItemSelected: (item) {
                  // Handle item selection
                  print('Selected: ${item.title}');
                },
              ),
            ),
            // Main content area
            Expanded(
              flex: 4,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Welcome to the Flutter Web Side Menu Example!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains a Row widget that divides the screen into two parts:
//    - The first part (flex: 1) is the side menu created using the SideMenu widget.
//    - The second part (flex: 4) is the main content area where a welcome message is displayed.
// 4. The SideMenu widget takes a list of MenuItem objects, each representing a menu option.
// 5. When a menu item is selected, the onItemSelected callback is triggered, printing the selected item's title to the console.
// 6. The main content area is centered and displays a welcome message, providing a clear indication of the app's purpose.
```
