# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Animated Icon Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `animated_icon` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_icon: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 4: Using the Animated Icon
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement an animated icon in your app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_icon/animated_icon.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Icon Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedIcon(
            icon: AnimatedIcons.menu_arrow,
            progress: AlwaysStoppedAnimation(0.5), // Set the animation progress
            size: 100.0,
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

This code creates a simple Flutter application with an animated icon in the center of the screen. You can adjust the `progress` property to control the animation state.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `animated_icon` package into your Flutter application successfully.

# Complete Example of Using the Animated Icon Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_icon/animated_icon.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  // Declare a controller for the animation
  late AnimationController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the AnimationController
    _controller = AnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Set the duration of the animation
      vsync: this,
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Icon Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Animated Icon that changes based on the controller's value
              AnimatedIcon(
                icon: AnimatedIcons.menu_arrow,
                progress: _controller, // Use the controller for animation progress
                size: 100.0,
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Toggle the animation when the button is pressed
                  if (_controller.isCompleted) {
                    _controller.reverse(); // Reverse the animation
                  } else {
                    _controller.forward(); // Play the animation forward
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Toggle Animation'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts by creating a `RealFlutter` widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// Inside the `initState` method, an `AnimationController` is initialized with a duration of 500 milliseconds.
// The `build` method returns a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// In the Center widget, a Column is used to stack the AnimatedIcon and a button vertically.
// The AnimatedIcon uses the `_controller` for its animation progress, allowing it to animate between states.
// When the button is pressed, it checks if the animation is completed. If it is, it reverses the animation; otherwise, it plays the animation forward.
// This creates an interactive experience where the user can toggle the animated icon by pressing the button.
