        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

# Complete Example of Using `fwfh_chewie`

Here’s a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `fwfh_chewie` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fwfh_chewie/fwfh_chewie.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'fwfh_chewie Example',
      home: VideoPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoPlayerScreenState createState() => _VideoPlayerScreenState();
}

class _VideoPlayerScreenState extends State<VideoPlayerScreen> {
  late VideoPlayerController _videoPlayerController;
  late ChewieController _chewieController;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the VideoPlayerController with a network video
    _videoPlayerController = VideoPlayerController.network('https://example.com/video.mp4');

    // Initialize the ChewieController
    _chewieController = ChewieController(
      videoPlayerController: _videoPlayerController,
      aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
      autoPlay: true,
      looping: true,
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controllers to free up resources
    _videoPlayerController.dispose();
    _chewieController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Player Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Use Chewie to display the video player
        child: Chewie(
          controller: _chewieController,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets VideoPlayerScreen as the home.
// 3. VideoPlayerScreen initializes the VideoPlayerController with a video URL and the ChewieController.
// 4. The Chewie widget is used to display the video player with controls.
// 5. The video plays automatically and loops due to the ChewieController settings.
// 6. When the screen is disposed, both controllers are disposed to free up resources.
```
