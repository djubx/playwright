# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Video Compress DS

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `video_compress_ds` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_compress_ds: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/video_compress_ds).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select videos.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to record videos.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to record audio.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to compress a video.

# Complete Example of Using Video Compress DS

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_compress_ds/video_compress_ds.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Video Compress Example',
      home: VideoCompressHome(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoCompressHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoCompressHomeState createState() => _VideoCompressHomeState();
}

class _VideoCompressHomeState extends State<VideoCompressHome> {
  String? _compressedVideoPath; // Variable to hold the path of the compressed video

  // Function to compress the video
  Future<void> _compressVideo(String videoPath) async {
    // Start the compression process
    final compressedVideo = await VideoCompress.compressVideo(
      videoPath,
      quality: VideoQuality.MediumQuality, // Set the desired quality
      deleteOrigin: true, // Option to delete the original video
    );

    // Update the state with the path of the compressed video
    setState(() {
      _compressedVideoPath = compressedVideo?.path;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Compress Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the compressed video path if available
            if (_compressedVideoPath != null)
              Text('Compressed Video Path: $_compressedVideoPath'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Replace with the path of the video you want to compress
                String videoPath = 'path_to_your_video.mp4';
                await _compressVideo(videoPath); // Call the compress function
              },
              child: Text('Compress Video'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that compresses a video file.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app and sets `RealFlutter` as the home widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` class builds the main MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. The `VideoCompressHome` stateful widget manages the video compression process.
// 4. The `_compressVideo` function takes a video path, compresses it using the `video_compress_ds` package, and updates the state with the compressed video path.
// 5. The UI displays a button to trigger the compression and shows the path of the compressed video once the process is complete.

In summary, this application allows users to compress a video file by clicking a button. The compressed video path is displayed on the screen, demonstrating the functionality of the `video_compress_ds` package effectively.
