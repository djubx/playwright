# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Icon Animated Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `icon_animated` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  icon_animated: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement an animated icon in a button.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:icon_animated/icon_animated.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Icon Animated Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: IconAnimated(
            icon: Icons.favorite,
            size: 100,
            duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
            onTap: () {
              // Action when the icon is tapped
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with an animated heart icon. The icon animates when tapped, providing visual feedback to the user.

# Complete Example of Using Icon Animated

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:icon_animated/icon_animated.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to track the icon state
  bool _isFavorited = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Icon Animated Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: IconAnimated(
            // Set the icon based on the state
            icon: _isFavorited ? Icons.favorite : Icons.favorite_border,
            size: 100,
            duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
            onTap: () {
              // Toggle the favorite state
              setState(() {
                _isFavorited = !_isFavorited;
              });
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. The _isFavorited variable tracks whether the icon is in a "favorited" state or not.
// 3. In the build method, we create a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The IconAnimated widget is used to display an icon that changes based on the _isFavorited state.
// 5. When the icon is tapped, the onTap callback is triggered, which toggles the _isFavorited state.
// 6. The icon updates to reflect the current state, animating smoothly between the filled and outlined heart icons.
```
