// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user enters the email address, subject, and body in the text fields.
// 2. When the user clicks the "Send Email" button, the `launchEmail` function is called.
// 3. The `launchEmail` function launches the default email client on the user's device.
// 4. The email client is populated with the email address, subject, and body entered by the user.
// 5. The user can then send the email using the email client.

// This code demonstrates how to use the `email_launcher` package to launch the email client and send an email.

// The `RealFlutter` class is the main class of the application.
// The `EmailLauncherDemo` class is a stateful widget that contains the text fields and button.
// The `_EmailLauncherDemoState` class is the state of the `EmailLauncherDemo` widget.

// The `launchEmail` function is called when the user clicks the "Send Email" button.
// The `launchEmail` function launches the default email client on the user's device.

// The application flow is handled by the `onPressed` callback of the button.
// The `onPressed` callback calls the `launchEmail` function when the button is clicked.

// The `launchEmail` function is a part of the `email_launcher` package.
// The `email_launcher` package is used to launch the email client and send an email.

// This code is a complete example of how to use the `email_launcher` package to launch the email client and send an email.
