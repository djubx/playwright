# Flutter Slider Drawer Package

The `flutter_slider_drawer` package is a versatile and easy-to-use library for implementing a slider drawer in Flutter applications. This package allows developers to create a sliding drawer that can be used for navigation or to display additional content. It is particularly useful in applications where space is limited, and a traditional navigation bar would take up too much room.

## Features

- **Customizable Drawer**: The package allows for extensive customization of the drawer's appearance and behavior.
- **Smooth Animations**: Provides smooth and responsive animations for opening and closing the drawer.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

## When to Use

- **Navigation**: Use the slider drawer to provide a navigation menu that can be accessed from any screen.
- **Additional Content**: Display additional content or options that do not fit on the main screen.
- **Responsive Design**: Ideal for applications that need to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flutter Slider Drawer

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `flutter_slider_drawer` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `flutter_slider_drawer` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_slider_drawer: ^3.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Import the Package**: Import the package in your Dart file where you plan to use the slider drawer.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_slider_drawer/flutter_slider_drawer.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.

  ```gradle
  defaultConfig {
      minSdkVersion 21
  }
  ```

### iOS

- No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Using the Package

1. **Create a RealFlutter Class**: This will be the main class where the slider drawer is implemented.

2. **Implement the Slider Drawer**: Use the `SliderDrawer` widget to create the drawer.

3. **Customize the Drawer**: Customize the drawer's appearance and behavior as needed.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_slider_drawer/flutter_slider_drawer.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Slider Drawer Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  GlobalKey<SliderDrawerState> _sliderDrawerKey = GlobalKey<SliderDrawerState>();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: SliderDrawer(
        key: _sliderDrawerKey,
        appBar: SliderAppBar(
          appBarColor: Colors.blue,
          title: Text(
            'Slider Drawer',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 22, fontWeight: FontWeight.w700),
          ),
        ),
        slider: _SliderMenu(),
        child: _MainContent(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class _SliderMenu extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      color: Colors.white,
      child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: <Widget>[
          ListTile(
            leading: Icon(Icons.home),
            title: Text('Home'),
            onTap: () {
              // Handle Home tap
            },
          ),
          ListTile(
            leading: Icon(Icons.settings),
            title: Text('Settings'),
            onTap: () {
              // Handle Settings tap
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

class _MainContent extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text(
        'Main Content Area',
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The `MyApp` class sets up the MaterialApp and specifies `RealFlutter` as the home widget.
// 2. `RealFlutter` is a stateful widget that manages the state of the slider drawer using a GlobalKey.
// 3. The `SliderDrawer` widget is used to create the drawer, with `_SliderMenu` as the slider content and `_MainContent` as the main content.
// 4. `_SliderMenu` contains a simple menu with two options: Home and Settings, each with an icon and a tap handler.
// 5. `_MainContent` displays the main content area of the app.
// 6. The drawer can be opened and closed using gestures or programmatically via the `SliderDrawerState` key.
