# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Palestine Connection Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **palestine_connection** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  palestine_connection: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to fetch data using the **palestine_connection** package.

# Complete Example: Using the Palestine Connection Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:palestine_connection/palestine_connection.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Palestine Connection Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  List<dynamic> _data = []; // Variable to hold fetched data
  bool _isLoading = true; // Loading state

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchData(); // Fetch data when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to fetch data from the Palestine API
  Future<void> _fetchData() async {
    try {
      // Create an instance of the RealFlutter class
      RealFlutter api = RealFlutter();
      // Fetch data from the API
      var response = await api.getData();
      setState(() {
        _data = response; // Update the state with fetched data
        _isLoading = false; // Set loading to false
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the fetch
      print("Error fetching data: $e");
      setState(() {
        _isLoading = false; // Set loading to false on error
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Palestine Connection'),
      ),
      body: _isLoading
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: _data.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(_data[index]['title']), // Display title from data
                  subtitle: Text(_data[index]['description']), // Display description
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// 2. `MyApp` sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home page as `HomePage`.
// 3. In `HomePage`, we define a stateful widget to manage the state of the data.
// 4. The `_fetchData` method is called in `initState`, which is executed when the widget is first created.
// 5. Inside `_fetchData`, we create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and call the `getData` method to fetch data from the API.
// 6. If the data is fetched successfully, we update the `_data` variable and set `_isLoading` to false to stop showing the loading indicator.
// 7. The `build` method checks if the data is still loading. If it is, a loading spinner is displayed. If not, a ListView is built to display the fetched data.
// 8. Each item in the ListView shows the title and description from the fetched data.
```
