# Exploring the `widget_with_codeview` Flutter Package

The `widget_with_codeview` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows you to display Flutter widgets alongside their corresponding source code. This package is particularly useful for educational purposes, documentation, or any scenario where you want to showcase how a widget is built and how it behaves in real-time.

## When to Use This Package
- **Educational Apps**: Ideal for apps that teach Flutter development by showing code snippets alongside live widgets.
- **Documentation**: Useful for creating interactive documentation that allows users to see the code and its output simultaneously.
- **Prototyping**: Great for quickly demonstrating widget designs and their implementations.

## Key Features
- **Live Code Preview**: Displays the widget and its code side by side, allowing for real-time updates.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the appearance of the code view to match your app's theme.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: The package supports syntax highlighting for better readability of the code.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

Overall, `widget_with_codeview` enhances the development experience by bridging the gap between code and visual representation, making it easier for developers and learners to understand Flutter widgets.

# Setting Up and Using `widget_with_codeview`

## Installation
To get started with the `widget_with_codeview` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  widget_with_codeview: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/widget_with_codeview).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `widget_with_codeview` package, you can wrap your widget with the `WidgetWithCodeView` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_with_codeview/widget_with_codeview.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Widget with Code View')),
      body: WidgetWithCodeView(
        code: '''
          Container(
            color: Colors.blue,
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
          )
        ''',
        child: Container(
          color: Colors.blue,
          width: 100,
          height: 100,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to display a blue container alongside its code representation. The `WidgetWithCodeView` widget takes two parameters: `code` (a string containing the widget's code) and `child` (the actual widget to be displayed).

# Complete Example of `widget_with_codeview`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_with_codeview/widget_with_codeview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Widget with Code View Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Widget with Code View')),
      body: WidgetWithCodeView(
        // The code that represents the widget being displayed
        code: '''
          Container(
            color: Colors.blue,
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
          )
        ''',
        // The actual widget that will be displayed
        child: Container(
          color: Colors.blue,
          width: 100,
          height: 100,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains a WidgetWithCodeView that displays a blue Container.
// 5. The code parameter shows the code for the blue Container, while the child parameter renders the actual widget.
// 6. As you modify the code string, the displayed widget updates in real-time, providing an interactive experience.
