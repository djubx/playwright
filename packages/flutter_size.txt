# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Size Package
---------------------------------------------

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project
-----------------------------------------

To use the `flutter_size` package, you need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file. Add the following line to the `dependencies` section:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_size: ^1.0.0
```

## Step 2: Import the Package
---------------------------

Import the `flutter_size` package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_size/flutter_size.dart';
```

## Step 3: Use the Package
-------------------------

To use the `flutter_size` package, you need to create an instance of the `FlutterSize` class and pass it to your widget tree. You can do this by wrapping your `MaterialApp` widget with the `FlutterSize` widget:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    FlutterSize(
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: RealFlutter(),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details
---------------------------

The `flutter_size` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you need to configure the package differently for each platform.

### Android

To use the `flutter_size` package on Android, you need to add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<application
  ...
  android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
  ...
>
```

### iOS

To use the `flutter_size` package on iOS, you need to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>
<false/>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_size/flutter_size.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    FlutterSize(
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: RealFlutter(),
      ),
    ),
  );
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Step 1: Create a variable to store the screen size
  Size _screenSize;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Step 2: Get the screen size using the FlutterSize package
    _screenSize = FlutterSize.getScreenSize(context);

    // Step 3: Use the screen size to create a responsive layout
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Size Package Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Screen Width: ${_screenSize.width}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            Text(
              'Screen Height: ${_screenSize.height}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application.
// 2. The FlutterSize package is initialized and gets the screen size.
// 3. The screen size is stored in the _screenSize variable.
// 4. The build method is called and uses the _screenSize variable to create a responsive layout.
// 5. The layout is displayed on the screen.

// In summary, the FlutterSize package is used to get the screen size and create a responsive layout.
// The package is initialized and gets the screen size when the application is run.
// The screen size is then used to create a responsive layout in the build method.
```
