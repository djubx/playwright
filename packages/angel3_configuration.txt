# Overview of the angel3_configuration Flutter Package

The `angel3_configuration` package is a powerful tool designed for managing application configurations in Flutter. It provides a structured way to handle configuration settings, making it easier to manage different environments (development, staging, production) and their respective settings. This package is particularly useful for applications that require dynamic configuration management, such as those that need to switch API endpoints or feature flags based on the environment.

## Key Features
- **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Easily manage different configurations for various environments.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that the configuration values are type-checked, reducing runtime errors.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications.
- **Support for JSON and YAML**: Load configurations from JSON or YAML files, making it flexible for different use cases.

## When to Use
- When your application needs to switch between different configurations based on the environment.
- If you want to manage feature flags or API endpoints dynamically.
- When you need a structured way to handle configuration settings without hardcoding values.

# Setting Up and Using angel3_configuration

## Installation
To get started with the `angel3_configuration` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  angel3_configuration: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/angel3_configuration).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the correct configurations. You may need to set up different build flavors if you want to manage configurations for different environments.

### iOS
For iOS, you can manage configurations using different schemes in Xcode. This allows you to set up different build configurations for development, staging, and production.

## Basic Usage
1. Create a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`) in your project root or assets folder.
2. Load the configuration using the `Configuration` class provided by the package.

### Example Configuration File (config.yaml)
```yaml
development:
  api_url: "https://dev.api.example.com"
  feature_flag: true

production:
  api_url: "https://api.example.com"
  feature_flag: false
```

### Loading Configuration
You can load the configuration in your main application file as follows:

```dart
import 'package:angel3_configuration/angel3_configuration.dart';

void main() async {
  // Load the configuration based on the current environment
  final config = await Configuration.load('config.yaml', environment: 'development');
  runApp(MyApp(config));
}
```

This setup allows you to easily switch between different configurations based on the environment you are running.

# Complete Example of Using angel3_configuration

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:angel3_configuration/angel3_configuration.dart';

void main() async {
  // Load the configuration based on the current environment
  final config = await Configuration.load('config.yaml', environment: 'development');
  runApp(MyApp(config));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final Configuration config;

  MyApp(this.config);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Angel Configuration Example',
      home: HomeScreen(config: config),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final Configuration config;

  HomeScreen({required this.config});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Configuration Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('API URL: ${config.get('api_url')}'), // Display the API URL
            Text('Feature Flag: ${config.get('feature_flag')}'), // Display the feature flag status
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application and loads the configuration from 'config.yaml'.
// 2. The environment is set to 'development', which means it will load the development settings.
// 3. The MyApp widget is created, passing the loaded configuration.
// 4. Inside MyApp, the HomeScreen widget is built, which receives the configuration.
// 5. The HomeScreen displays the API URL and feature flag status based on the loaded configuration.
// 6. The UI updates automatically if the configuration changes, allowing for dynamic management of settings.
