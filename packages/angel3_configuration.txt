// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The `main` function is called, which creates an instance of the `RealFlutter` class.
// 2. The `loadConfiguration` method is called on the `RealFlutter` instance, which loads the configuration from the `config.json` file.
// 3. The loaded configuration is used to retrieve the API key for the development environment.
// 4. The API key is printed to the console.
// 5. The Flutter app is run using the `runApp` function.
// 6. The `MyApp` widget is built and displayed on the screen.
