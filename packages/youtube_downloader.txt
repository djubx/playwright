# Tutorial: Setting Up the YouTube Downloader Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `youtube_downloader` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `youtube_downloader` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  youtube_downloader: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/youtube_downloader).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save downloaded videos.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video recording.</string>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:youtube_downloader/youtube_downloader.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the `youtube_downloader` package to download videos. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate a download:

```dart
void downloadVideo(String videoUrl) async {
  try {
    var result = await YoutubeDownloader.download(videoUrl);
    print('Video downloaded to: ${result.path}');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error downloading video: $e');
  }
}
```

This function takes a YouTube video URL and attempts to download it, printing the path where the video is saved.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `youtube_downloader` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example: YouTube Downloader App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:youtube_downloader/youtube_downloader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'YouTube Downloader',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DownloadPage(),
    );
  }
}

class DownloadPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DownloadPageState createState() => _DownloadPageState();
}

class _DownloadPageState extends State<DownloadPage> {
  String _videoUrl = '';
  String _downloadStatus = '';

  // Function to handle video download
  void _downloadVideo() async {
    if (_videoUrl.isNotEmpty) {
      setState(() {
        _downloadStatus = 'Downloading...';
      });
      try {
        // Initiating the download
        var result = await YoutubeDownloader.download(_videoUrl);
        setState(() {
          _downloadStatus = 'Video downloaded to: ${result.path}';
        });
      } catch (e) {
        setState(() {
          _downloadStatus = 'Error: $e';
        });
      }
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _downloadStatus = 'Please enter a valid video URL.';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('YouTube Downloader'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter YouTube Video URL',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
              onChanged: (value) {
                _videoUrl = value; // Update video URL on input change
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _downloadVideo, // Trigger download on button press
              child: Text('Download Video'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_downloadStatus), // Display download status
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and points to the DownloadPage as the home screen.
// 3. The DownloadPage contains a TextField for the user to input a YouTube video URL and a button to initiate the download.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _downloadVideo function is called, which checks if the URL is valid.
// 5. If valid, it attempts to download the video using the YoutubeDownloader package and updates the status accordingly.
// 6. The download status is displayed to the user, providing feedback on the download process.
```
