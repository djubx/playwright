# Setting Up and Using June
=============================

### Step 1: Add June to Your Project

To use June in your Flutter project, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  june: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import June

Import June in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:june/june.dart';
```

### Step 3: Use June Widgets

June provides a set of pre-built widgets that you can use to build your application. For example, you can use the `JuneButton` widget to create a custom button:

```dart
JuneButton(
  child: Text('Click me'),
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

June is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to configure certain platform-specific settings to get the most out of June.

#### Android

To use June on Android, you need to add the following configuration to your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<application
  ...
  android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
  ...
>
```

#### iOS

To use June on iOS, you need to add the following configuration to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:june/june.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a JuneButton widget
    JuneButton button = JuneButton(
      child: Text('Click me'),
      onPressed: () {
        // Handle button press
        print('Button pressed');
      },
    );

    // Create a JuneTextField widget
    JuneTextField textField = JuneTextField(
      decoration: InputDecoration(
        labelText: 'Enter your name',
      ),
    );

    // Create a JuneCheckbox widget
    JuneCheckbox checkbox = JuneCheckbox(
      value: true,
      onChanged: (value) {
        // Handle checkbox change
        print('Checkbox changed: $value');
      },
    );

    // Create a JuneSwitch widget
    JuneSwitch switchWidget = JuneSwitch(
      value: true,
      onChanged: (value) {
        // Handle switch change
        print('Switch changed: $value');
      },
    );

    // Create a JuneSlider widget
    JuneSlider slider = JuneSlider(
      value: 50,
      onChanged: (value) {
        // Handle slider change
        print('Slider changed: $value');
      },
    );

    // Create a JuneAppBar widget
    JuneAppBar appBar = JuneAppBar(
      title: Text('Real Flutter'),
    );

    // Create a JuneScaffold widget
    JuneScaffold scaffold = JuneScaffold(
      appBar: appBar,
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            button,
            textField,
            checkbox,
            switchWidget,
            slider,
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );

    // Return the JuneScaffold widget
    return scaffold;
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created and returned.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget creates and returns a JuneScaffold widget.
// 4. The JuneScaffold widget creates and returns a JuneAppBar widget and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget creates and returns a Column widget.
// 6. The Column widget creates and returns a JuneButton widget, a JuneTextField widget, a JuneCheckbox widget, a JuneSwitch widget, and a JuneSlider widget.
// 7. The user interacts with the widgets, and the corresponding events are handled.
// 8. The application continues to run until the user closes it.

// Final summary: The code creates a RealFlutter widget that returns a JuneScaffold widget. The JuneScaffold widget contains a JuneAppBar widget and a Center widget. The Center widget contains a Column widget that contains various June widgets. The user interacts with the widgets, and the corresponding events are handled.
