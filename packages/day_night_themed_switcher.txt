# Tutorial: Setting Up day_night_themed_switcher

## Installation
To use the `day_night_themed_switcher` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  day_night_themed_switcher: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash

```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Usage
To use the `day_night_themed_switcher`, you need to wrap your application with a `MaterialApp` and implement the switcher in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:day_night_themed_switcher/day_night_themed_switcher.dart';
```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the theme state:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool isDarkMode = false; // Initial theme state

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      theme: isDarkMode ? ThemeData.dark() : ThemeData.light(),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Day Night Themed Switcher'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DayNightSwitcher(
            isDarkModeEnabled: isDarkMode,
            onStateChanged: (value) {
              setState(() {
                isDarkMode = value; // Update the theme state
              });
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic application with a day/night switcher. The `isDarkMode` variable controls the current theme, and the `DayNightSwitcher` widget allows users to toggle between themes.

# Complete Example of day_night_themed_switcher

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:day_night_themed_switcher/day_night_themed_switcher.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool isDarkMode = false; // Variable to track the current theme state

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      theme: isDarkMode ? ThemeData.dark() : ThemeData.light(), // Set theme based on isDarkMode
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Day Night Themed Switcher'), // App title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DayNightSwitcher(
            isDarkModeEnabled: isDarkMode, // Pass the current theme state
            onStateChanged: (value) {
              setState(() {
                isDarkMode = value; // Update the theme state when switcher is toggled
              });
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the theme state (isDarkMode).
// 3. The build method returns a MaterialApp with a theme based on isDarkMode.
// 4. The DayNightSwitcher widget is placed in the center of the screen.
// 5. When the switcher is toggled, it calls onStateChanged, which updates the isDarkMode state.
// 6. The UI rebuilds with the new theme based on the updated isDarkMode value.
