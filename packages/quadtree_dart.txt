# Quadtree Dart: Efficient Spatial Partitioning for Flutter

The `quadtree_dart` package is a powerful tool for developers looking to implement spatial partitioning in their Flutter applications. A quadtree is a tree data structure that is particularly useful for organizing points in a two-dimensional space. This package is ideal for applications that require efficient collision detection, spatial indexing, or rendering of large datasets, such as games, mapping applications, or any scenario where you need to manage a large number of objects in a 2D space.

## When to Use `quadtree_dart`
- **Game Development**: For managing game objects and optimizing collision detection.
- **Mapping Applications**: To efficiently handle and display geographical data points.
- **Data Visualization**: When rendering large datasets where performance is critical.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Insertion and Removal**: Easily add or remove objects from the quadtree.
- **Efficient Querying**: Quickly find objects within a specified area.
- **Customizable Node Capacity**: Adjust the number of objects each node can hold for optimal performance.
- **2D Spatial Partitioning**: Specifically designed for two-dimensional space, making it ideal for various applications.

The `quadtree_dart` package provides a robust solution for developers needing efficient spatial data management in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `quadtree_dart`

## Installation
To get started with the `quadtree_dart` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  quadtree_dart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `quadtree_dart` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no specific configurations required for either platform, making it easy to integrate into your Flutter application.

## Basic Usage
To use the `quadtree_dart` package, you will typically follow these steps:

1. **Create a Quadtree Instance**: Initialize a quadtree with a defined boundary and capacity.
2. **Insert Objects**: Add objects to the quadtree.
3. **Query Objects**: Retrieve objects within a specific area.
4. **Remove Objects**: Remove objects when they are no longer needed.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up and use the quadtree:

```dart
import 'package:quadtree_dart/quadtree_dart.dart';

void main() {
  // Define the boundary of the quadtree
  final boundary = Rectangle(0, 0, 400, 400);
  
  // Create a quadtree with a capacity of 4
  final quadtree = Quadtree<YourObjectType>(boundary, 4);
  
  // Insert objects into the quadtree
  quadtree.insert(YourObjectType(50, 50));
  quadtree.insert(YourObjectType(100, 100));
  
  // Query objects within a specific area
  final foundObjects = quadtree.query(Rectangle(0, 0, 200, 200));
  
  // Remove an object
  quadtree.remove(YourObjectType(50, 50));
}
```

This example demonstrates the basic operations you can perform with the `quadtree_dart` package. For more advanced usage, refer to the official documentation.

# Complete Example of Using `quadtree_dart`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:quadtree_dart/quadtree_dart.dart';

// Define a simple object type to be stored in the quadtree
class YourObjectType {
  final double x;
  final double y;

  YourObjectType(this.x, this.y);
}

// Main application class
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Quadtree Example',
      home: QuadtreeDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class QuadtreeDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _QuadtreeDemoState createState() => _QuadtreeDemoState();
}

class _QuadtreeDemoState extends State<QuadtreeDemo> {
  // Define the quadtree boundary and capacity
  final Rectangle boundary = Rectangle(0, 0, 400, 400);
  late Quadtree<YourObjectType> quadtree;
  List<YourObjectType> objects = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the quadtree
    quadtree = Quadtree<YourObjectType>(boundary, 4);
    // Populate the quadtree with random objects
    _populateQuadtree();
  }

  void _populateQuadtree() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
      // Create random objects and insert them into the quadtree
      final obj = YourObjectType(
        (i * 20).toDouble(),
        (i * 10).toDouble(),
      );
      quadtree.insert(obj);
      objects.add(obj);
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Quadtree Demo')),
      body: CustomPaint(
        size: Size(400, 400),
        painter: QuadtreePainter(quadtree, objects),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Custom painter to visualize the quadtree and its objects
class QuadtreePainter extends CustomPainter {
  final Quadtree<YourObjectType> quadtree;
  final List<YourObjectType> objects;

  QuadtreePainter(this.quadtree, this.objects);

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Draw the quadtree boundaries
    _drawQuadtree(canvas, quadtree);
    // Draw the objects
    for (var obj in objects) {
      canvas.drawCircle(Offset(obj.x, obj.y), 5, Paint()..color = Colors.blue);
    }
  }

  void _drawQuadtree(Canvas canvas, Quadtree<YourObjectType> quadtree) {
    // Draw the boundary of the quadtree
    final paint = Paint()..color = Colors.red.withOpacity(0.5);
    canvas.drawRect(Rect.fromLTWH(quadtree.boundary.left, quadtree.boundary.top,
        quadtree.boundary.width, quadtree.boundary.height), paint);
    
    // Recursively draw child nodes if they exist
    for (var child in quadtree.children) {
      if (child != null) {
        _drawQuadtree(canvas, child);
      }
    }
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return true; // Repaint whenever the state changes
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds the MaterialApp and sets QuadtreeDemo as the home screen.
// 3. QuadtreeDemo initializes a quadtree in its state and populates it with random objects.
// 4. The CustomPaint widget is used to visualize the quadtree and its objects.
// 5. QuadtreePainter is responsible for drawing the quadtree boundaries and the objects on the canvas.
// 6. The quadtree boundaries are drawn in red, and the objects are represented as blue circles.
