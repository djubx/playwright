# Flutter TreeView Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_treeview` package is a powerful tool for creating tree-like structures in Flutter applications. It allows developers to display hierarchical data in a visually appealing and interactive manner. This package is particularly useful for applications that require a structured representation of data, such as file explorers, organizational charts, or any scenario where nested data needs to be presented.

## When to Use `flutter_treeview`

You should consider using the `flutter_treeview` package in the following scenarios:

- **Hierarchical Data Representation**: When your application needs to display data in a parent-child relationship, such as categories and subcategories.
- **File Management Applications**: For applications that require a file explorer-like interface, where users can navigate through folders and files.
- **Organizational Structures**: To visualize organizational charts or team structures where members are grouped under different departments or teams.

## Features of `flutter_treeview`

- **Customizable Nodes**: Each node in the tree can be customized with different widgets, allowing for a rich user interface.
- **Expandable and Collapsible Nodes**: Users can expand or collapse nodes to navigate through the tree structure easily.
- **Selectable Nodes**: Nodes can be made selectable, enabling users to interact with them and perform actions based on their selection.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: The tree can be updated dynamically, allowing for real-time changes in the displayed data.

Overall, the `flutter_treeview` package provides a flexible and efficient way to manage and display hierarchical data in Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the `flutter_treeview` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_treeview` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_treeview` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_treeview: ^0.5.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `flutter_treeview` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_treeview/flutter_treeview.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Configuration

### For Android

Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### For iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the TreeView Widget

You can now use the `TreeView` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
TreeView(
  nodes: [
    Node(
      label: 'Root',
      children: [
        Node(label: 'Child 1'),
        Node(label: 'Child 2', children: [
          Node(label: 'Grandchild 1'),
          Node(label: 'Grandchild 2'),
        ]),
      ],
    ),
  ],
)
```

This code creates a simple tree with a root node and two child nodes, one of which has its own children.

## Step 5: Customizing Nodes

You can customize the appearance of nodes by providing a widget for the `label` property. For example:

```dart
Node(
  label: Text('Custom Node', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue)),
)
```

## Conclusion

You have now set up the `flutter_treeview` package in your Flutter application. You can create, customize, and manage tree structures effectively. In the next section, we will provide a complete example demonstrating all key features of the package.

# Complete Example of `flutter_treeview`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_treeview/flutter_treeview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter TreeView Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter TreeView Example'),
        ),
        body: TreeViewExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class TreeViewExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TreeViewExampleState createState() => _TreeViewExampleState();
}

class _TreeViewExampleState extends State<TreeViewExample> {
  // Define the nodes for the tree
  List<Node> nodes = [
    Node(
      label: 'Root',
      children: [
        Node(label: 'Child 1'),
        Node(label: 'Child 2', children: [
          Node(label: 'Grandchild 1'),
          Node(label: 'Grandchild 2'),
        ]),
      ],
    ),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return TreeView(
      nodes: nodes,
      // Handle node selection
      onNodeTap: (key) {
        // Show a dialog with the selected node's label
        showDialog(
          context: context,
          builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
            title: Text('Node Selected'),
            content: Text('You selected: $key'),
            actions: [
              TextButton(
                onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                child: Text('OK'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold containing an AppBar and the TreeViewExample widget.
// 3. TreeViewExample is a stateful widget that defines a list of nodes representing the tree structure.
// 4. The TreeView widget is built using the defined nodes and includes an onNodeTap callback to handle node selection.
// 5. When a node is tapped, an AlertDialog is displayed showing the label of the selected node.
```

// Final Summary:
// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget. This widget sets up a basic Flutter app with an AppBar and a body containing the `TreeViewExample` widget. The `TreeViewExample` widget defines a simple tree structure with a root node and its children. When a user taps on a node, an alert dialog is displayed showing the label of the selected node, demonstrating the interactive capabilities of the `flutter_treeview` package.
