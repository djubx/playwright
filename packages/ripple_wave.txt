# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Ripple Wave Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **ripple_wave** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ripple_wave: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions or configurations in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. However, the **ripple_wave** package does not require any specific configurations for basic usage.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a ripple effect on a button.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ripple_wave/ripple_wave.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Ripple Wave Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: RippleWave(
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                print('Button Pressed!');
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we wrap an `ElevatedButton` with the `RippleWave` widget, which adds the ripple effect when the button is pressed.

# Complete Example of Ripple Wave Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ripple_wave/ripple_wave.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Ripple Wave Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the RippleWave widget in the middle of the screen
          child: RippleWave(
            color: Colors.blue, // Setting the ripple color
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                print('Button Pressed!'); // Log to console
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'), // Button text
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget holds the RippleWave widget, which wraps an ElevatedButton.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered, printing 'Button Pressed!' to the console.
// 7. The RippleWave widget adds a ripple effect to the button when it is tapped, enhancing the user experience.
