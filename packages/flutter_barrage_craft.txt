# Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_barrage_craft` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_barrage_craft: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `RealFlutter` class to create a barrage effect.

# Complete Example of Using flutter_barrage_craft

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_barrage_craft/flutter_barrage_craft.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Barrage Craft Example',
      home: BarrageHome(),
    );
  }
}

class BarrageHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BarrageHomeState createState() => _BarrageHomeState();
}

class _BarrageHomeState extends State<BarrageHome> {
  // Create a list of barrage items
  final List<String> barrageItems = [
    "Hello World!",
    "Welcome to Flutter!",
    "Enjoy the Barrage Effect!",
    "Flutter is Awesome!",
    "Happy Coding!"
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Barrage Craft Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Barrage(
          // Set the barrage items
          items: barrageItems,
          // Customize the barrage properties
          itemBuilder: (context, item) {
            return Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
              color: Colors.blueAccent,
              child: Text(
                item,
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
              ),
            );
          },
          // Set the barrage speed and direction
          speed: 100.0,
          direction: BarrageDirection.right, // Options: left, right
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. BarrageHome is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the barrage items.
// 4. In the build method of BarrageHome, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Barrage widget is used to display the barrage items, which are defined in the barrageItems list.
// 6. Each item is styled with padding and a background color, and the text is displayed in white.
// 7. The speed and direction of the barrage effect are set, allowing for customization of the animation.
```
