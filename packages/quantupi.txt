## Setup Process

To get started with the **quantupi** package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the **quantupi** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  quantupi: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

### Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add any necessary permissions or configurations required by the package.

### Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart files, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:quantupi/quantupi.dart';
```

## Using the Package

To use the **quantupi** package, you can create a simple application that demonstrates its capabilities. Below is a basic example of how to create and manipulate qubits.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:quantupi/quantupi.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Quantum Computing Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: QuantumHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class QuantumHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _QuantumHomePageState createState() => _QuantumHomePageState();
}

class _QuantumHomePageState extends State<QuantumHomePage> {
  // Initialize a quantum circuit
  QuantumCircuit circuit = QuantumCircuit();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Create a qubit and apply a Hadamard gate
    Qubit qubit = circuit.createQubit();
    circuit.applyGate(HadamardGate(), qubit);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Quantum Circuit Simulation'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Measure the qubit and display the result
            String result = circuit.measureQubit();
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                title: Text('Measurement Result'),
                content: Text('Qubit measured: $result'),
                actions: [
                  TextButton(
                    onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                    child: Text('OK'),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Measure Qubit'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home page is set to QuantumHomePage, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In the initState method, a quantum circuit is initialized, and a qubit is created.
// 5. A Hadamard gate is applied to the qubit, putting it into a superposition state.
// 6. The build method creates a button that, when pressed, measures the qubit.
// 7. The measurement result is displayed in a dialog box.
```
