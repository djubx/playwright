# Function Tree Flutter Package

The **function_tree** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for the creation of complex function trees, enabling the management of function calls and their relationships in a structured manner. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to manage multiple functions that may depend on one another, such as in state management, event handling, or when implementing complex business logic.

## When to Use

You might consider using the **function_tree** package in the following scenarios:

- **State Management**: When you need to manage the state of your application based on multiple function calls.
- **Event Handling**: If your application requires handling events that trigger multiple functions in a specific order.
- **Complex Business Logic**: When your application has intricate business rules that require a clear structure for function execution.

## Features

- **Hierarchical Function Management**: Organize functions in a tree structure, making it easier to visualize and manage dependencies.
- **Dynamic Function Execution**: Execute functions dynamically based on user interactions or other events.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to handle errors during function execution, ensuring robustness.

By leveraging the **function_tree** package, developers can create more maintainable and scalable Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Function Tree

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **function_tree** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **function_tree** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  function_tree: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to create a function tree and execute functions based on user input.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:function_tree/function_tree.dart';
```

2. Create a class that utilizes the function tree:

```dart
class RealFlutter {
  // Define your functions here
  void functionA() {
    print("Function A executed");
  }

  void functionB() {
    print("Function B executed");
  }

  void functionC() {
    print("Function C executed");
  }

  // Create a function tree
  void createFunctionTree() {
    final tree = FunctionTree();

    // Add functions to the tree
    tree.addFunction('A', functionA);
    tree.addFunction('B', functionB);
    tree.addFunction('C', functionC);

    // Define relationships
    tree.addDependency('A', 'B'); // B depends on A
    tree.addDependency('B', 'C'); // C depends on B

    // Execute the tree
    tree.execute('A'); // This will execute A, then B, then C
  }
}
```

3. Call the `createFunctionTree` method in your main application to see it in action.

With these steps, you have successfully set up and utilized the **function_tree** package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Function Tree in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:function_tree/function_tree.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Function Tree Example',
      home: FunctionTreeDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class FunctionTreeDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FunctionTreeDemoState createState() => _FunctionTreeDemoState();
}

class _FunctionTreeDemoState extends State<FunctionTreeDemo> {
  // Create an instance of RealFlutter
  final RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Function Tree Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Call the function to create and execute the function tree
            realFlutter.createFunctionTree();
          },
          child: Text('Execute Function Tree'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter {
  // Define your functions here
  void functionA() {
    print("Function A executed");
  }

  void functionB() {
    print("Function B executed");
  }

  void functionC() {
    print("Function C executed");
  }

  // Create a function tree
  void createFunctionTree() {
    final tree = FunctionTree();

    // Add functions to the tree
    tree.addFunction('A', functionA);
    tree.addFunction('B', functionB);
    tree.addFunction('C', functionC);

    // Define relationships
    tree.addDependency('A', 'B'); // B depends on A
    tree.addDependency('B', 'C'); // C depends on B

    // Execute the tree
    tree.execute('A'); // This will execute A, then B, then C
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button on the screen.
// 2. When the button is pressed, it triggers the createFunctionTree method in the RealFlutter class.
// 3. The createFunctionTree method initializes a FunctionTree instance.
// 4. It adds three functions (A, B, C) to the tree and sets up dependencies.
// 5. When executing function A, it will automatically execute function B and then function C in order.
// 6. Each function prints a message to the console indicating it has been executed.
