// This is the main entry point of the app.
// First, we initialize Instabug with our token and invocation events.
// Then, we create a Dio instance and add the InstabugDioInterceptor to it.
// Finally, we run the app with the Dio instance.

// In the MyApp widget, we create a Material app with a title and a home page.
// In the MyHomePage widget, we create a scaffold with an app bar and a body.
// In the body, we have a button that makes a network request using Dio when pressed.

// When the button is pressed, the InstabugDioInterceptor will track the network request and response.
// If there is an error, the InstabugDioInterceptor will also track the error.
// We can view the tracked requests and errors in the Instabug dashboard.
