# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Choice Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Choice package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  choice: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the Choice package:

```dart
import 'package:choice/choice.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Choice Widget

You can now use the Choice widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a choice selection:

```dart
Choice(
  options: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
  onChanged: (value) {
    print('Selected: $value');
  },
);
```

This code snippet creates a choice widget with three options. When an option is selected, it prints the selected value to the console.

## Conclusion

The Choice package is a versatile tool for creating selection interfaces in Flutter applications. With easy setup and customization options, it can significantly enhance user interaction.

# Complete Example of the Choice Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:choice/choice.dart'; // Importing the Choice package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Choice Package Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Choice Package Demo'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ChoiceExample(), // Calling the ChoiceExample widget
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ChoiceExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ChoiceExampleState createState() => _ChoiceExampleState();
}

class _ChoiceExampleState extends State<ChoiceExample> {
  String? selectedOption; // Variable to hold the selected option

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text(
          'Select an Option:',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Displaying the prompt
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between elements
        Choice(
          options: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'], // Options for selection
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              selectedOption = value; // Updating the selected option
            });
          },
          selected: selectedOption, // Highlighting the selected option
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between elements
        Text(
          selectedOption != null ? 'You selected: $selectedOption' : 'No option selected', // Displaying the selected option
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the ChoiceExample widget.
// 4. The ChoiceExample widget maintains the state of the selected option.
// 5. When an option is selected, the onChanged callback updates the selectedOption variable.
// 6. The selected option is displayed below the choice widget, providing feedback to the user.
```
