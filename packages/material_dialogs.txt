# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Material Dialogs

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **material_dialogs** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  material_dialogs: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions if you plan to use features that require them (e.g., internet access). Typically, no additional configuration is needed for basic dialog usage.

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file if you are using features that require permissions. However, for standard dialog usage, no specific configurations are required.

## Step 3: Using Material Dialogs

Hereâ€™s how to use the **material_dialogs** package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:material_dialogs/material_dialogs.dart';
```

2. Create a function to show a dialog. For example, to show a simple alert dialog:

```dart
void showAlertDialog(BuildContext context) {
  Dialogs.materialDialog(
    context: context,
    title: 'Alert',
    description: 'This is an alert dialog.',
    onClose: () {
      // Handle the close action
    },
  );
}
```

3. Call this function from a button or any other widget to display the dialog.

## Example Usage

You can create a button that triggers the alert dialog when pressed:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () => showAlertDialog(context),
  child: Text('Show Alert'),
)
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate and use the **material_dialogs** package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Material Dialogs

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:material_dialogs/material_dialogs.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Material Dialogs Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Material Dialogs Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () => showAlertDialog(context), // Show alert dialog on button press
            child: Text('Show Alert'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to show an alert dialog
  void showAlertDialog(BuildContext context) {
    Dialogs.materialDialog(
      context: context,
      title: 'Alert',
      description: 'This is an alert dialog.',
      onClose: () {
        // Handle the close action
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the showAlertDialog function is called.
// 5. The showAlertDialog function uses the material_dialogs package to display an alert dialog with a title and description.
// 6. The dialog can be closed by the user, and any additional actions can be handled in the onClose callback.
