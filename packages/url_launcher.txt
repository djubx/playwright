# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using url_launcher

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `url_launcher` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  url_launcher: ^6.0.20  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your app has the necessary permissions. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to allow your app to open URLs:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>http</string>
    <string>https</string>
    <string>tel</string>
    <string>mailto</string>
    <string>sms</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to launch a URL:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('URL Launcher Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              const url = 'https://flutter.dev';
              if (await canLaunch(url)) {
                await launch(url);
              } else {
                throw 'Could not launch $url';
              }
            },
            child: Text('Open Flutter Website'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, it checks if the URL can be launched and then opens it in the default web browser.

              // Button to make a phone call
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  const phoneNumber = 'tel:+1234567890'; // Phone number to call
                  if (await canLaunch(phoneNumber)) {
                    await launch(phoneNumber); // Launch phone dialer
                  } else {

              ),
              // Button to send an email
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  const email = 'mailto:test@example.com?subject=Hello&body=How are you?'; // Email details
                  if (await canLaunch(email)) {
                    await launch(email); // Launch email client
                  } else {
                    throw 'Could not launch $email'; // Error handling
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Send Email'),
              ),
              // Button to open a map
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  const mapUrl = 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=37.4220,-122.0841'; // Map coordinates
                  if (await canLaunch(mapUrl)) {
                    await launch(mapUrl); // Launch map application
                  } else {
                    throw 'Could not launch $mapUrl'; // Error handling
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Open Maps'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange multiple buttons vertically.
// 4. Each button has an onPressed callback that attempts to launch a specific URL or action:
//    - The first button opens the Flutter website.
//    - The second button initiates a phone call to the specified number.
//    - The third button opens the email client with pre-filled details.
//    - The fourth button opens Google Maps with specified coordinates.
// 5. Each action checks if the URL can be launched using canLaunch() and handles errors appropriately.
