# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using android_x_storage

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `android_x_storage` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  android_x_storage: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/android_x_storage).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

2. **Target SDK**: Ensure your `targetSdkVersion` is set to 30 or higher in `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   android {
       compileSdkVersion 31
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           targetSdkVersion 31
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Open your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys:

   ```xml
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library to save files.</string>
   <key>NSDocumentsUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your documents to save files.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to use the `android_x_storage` package to create, read, and delete a file.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:android_x_storage/android_x_storage.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Android X Storage Example',
      home: StorageExample(),
    );
  }
}

class StorageExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StorageExampleState createState() => _StorageExampleState();
}

class _StorageExampleState extends State<StorageExample> {
  String _filePath = '';
  String _fileContent = 'Hello, Android X Storage!';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the storage and create a file
    _createFile();
  }

  // Method to create a file
  Future<void> _createFile() async {
    // Get the directory to store the file
    final directory = await AndroidXStorage.getExternalStorageDirectory();
    // Define the file path
    _filePath = '${directory.path}/example.txt';
    // Write content to the file
    await AndroidXStorage.writeFile(_filePath, _fileContent);
    setState(() {});
  }

  // Method to read the file
  Future<void> _readFile() async {
    // Read the content of the file
    String content = await AndroidXStorage.readFile(_filePath);
    setState(() {
      _fileContent = content;
    });
  }

  // Method to delete the file
  Future<void> _deleteFile() async {
    await AndroidXStorage.deleteFile(_filePath);
    setState(() {
      _fileContent = 'File deleted!';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Storage Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('File Path: $_filePath'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('File Content: $_fileContent'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _readFile,
              child: Text('Read File'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _deleteFile,
              child: Text('Delete File'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the main function runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp and sets StorageExample as the home.
// 3. In StorageExample, the _createFile method is called during initState to create a file with initial content.
// 4. The file path and content are displayed on the screen.
// 5. The user can press the "Read File" button to read the content of the file, which updates the displayed content.
// 6. The "Delete File" button allows the user to delete the file, updating the displayed content to indicate the file has been deleted.
