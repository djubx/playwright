# Overview of the `design_tools` Flutter Package

The `design_tools` package is a powerful Flutter library designed to streamline the design process for developers and designers alike. It provides a set of tools that facilitate the creation of visually appealing and responsive user interfaces. This package is particularly useful when you want to implement design systems, manage design tokens, or create reusable components that adhere to specific design guidelines.

## When to Use `design_tools`

- **Design System Implementation**: When you need to maintain consistency across your application by using a design system.
- **Component Reusability**: If you want to create reusable UI components that can be easily shared across different parts of your application.
- **Design Token Management**: When you need to manage design tokens (like colors, typography, spacing) in a structured way.

## Key Features

- **Design Tokens**: Easily define and manage design tokens for colors, typography, and spacing.
- **Responsive Components**: Create components that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Customizable Themes**: Implement customizable themes that can be applied across your application.
- **Utility Functions**: Access utility functions for common design tasks, such as spacing and alignment.

# Setting Up and Using the `design_tools` Package

## Installation

To get started with the `design_tools` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  design_tools: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `design_tools` package, you need to import it into your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:design_tools/design_tools.dart';
```

You can then start using its features, such as defining design tokens and creating responsive components.

### Example of Defining Design Tokens

```dart
final Color primaryColor = DesignTokens.color.primary;
final double defaultSpacing = DesignTokens.spacing.medium;
```

This allows you to maintain a consistent design throughout your application.

# Complete Example of Using `design_tools`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:design_tools/design_tools.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Design Tools Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primaryColor: DesignTokens.color.primary, // Using design token for primary color
        textTheme: TextTheme(
          bodyText1: TextStyle(
            fontSize: DesignTokens.typography.body, // Using design token for typography
          ),
        ),
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(DesignTokens.spacing.large), // Using design token for spacing
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              'Welcome to Design Tools!',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.bodyText1,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: DesignTokens.spacing.medium), // Using design token for spacing
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
              },
              child: Text('Get Started'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a defined theme using design tokens for colors and typography.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is set as the home of the MaterialApp.
// 4. HomeScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body that includes a welcome message and a button.
// 5. Padding is applied using design tokens to ensure consistent spacing.
// 6. The button is set up to perform an action when pressed, which can be defined later.
