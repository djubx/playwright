# Complete Example of simple_form_builder

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_form_builder/simple_form_builder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Form Builder Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Form Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: SimpleFormBuilder(
            fields: [
              // Define a text field for username
              FormFieldConfig(
                name: 'username',
                label: 'Username',
                validator: (value) => value.isEmpty ? 'Please enter a username' : null,
              ),
              // Define a password field
              FormFieldConfig(
                name: 'password',
                label: 'Password',
                validator: (value) => value.length < 6 ? 'Password too short' : null,
                obscureText: true, // Hide the password input
              ),
            ],
            onSubmit: (formData) {
              // Handle form submission
              // Here we simply print the form data to the console
              print('Form submitted: $formData');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// Inside the Scaffold, we have an AppBar with the title 'Form Example'.
// The body of the Scaffold contains a SimpleFormBuilder widget.
// We define two fields: 'username' and 'password', each with validation logic.
// When the form is submitted, the onSubmit callback is triggered, printing the form data to the console.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->
```

### Summary of Application Flow
The application begins by running the `RealFlutter` widget, which sets up a Material app with a title and a simple form. The form consists of two fields: a username and a password, each with validation rules. When the user submits the form, the data is printed to the console, demonstrating how to handle form submissions effectively. This example showcases the ease of use and flexibility of the `simple_form_builder` package in creating forms in Flutter applications.
