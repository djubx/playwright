# flutterzilla_fixed_grid Package Overview

The `flutterzilla_fixed_grid` package is a powerful Flutter library designed to create fixed grid layouts with ease. It allows developers to build responsive and visually appealing grid interfaces that can adapt to various screen sizes and orientations. This package is particularly useful for applications that require a structured layout, such as photo galleries, product listings, or any content that benefits from a grid format.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutterzilla_fixed_grid` package when:
- You need a grid layout that maintains a fixed number of columns regardless of the screen size.
- You want to create a responsive design that adapts to different devices without losing the grid structure.
- You are developing applications that require a consistent layout for displaying items, such as e-commerce apps or media galleries.

## Features

- **Fixed Column Count**: Define a specific number of columns for your grid, ensuring a consistent layout across devices.
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adjusts the size of grid items based on the available screen space.
- **Customizable Item Size**: Control the width and height of grid items to fit your design needs.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and usage, making it easy to incorporate into existing Flutter projects.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutterzilla_fixed_grid

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutterzilla_fixed_grid` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutterzilla_fixed_grid: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your `ios/Podfile` has the platform version set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a fixed grid layout using the `flutterzilla_fixed_grid` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutterzilla_fixed_grid/flutterzilla_fixed_grid.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Fixed Grid Example'),
        ),
        body: FixedGrid(
          itemCount: 20, // Total number of items
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return Card(
              color: Colors.blueAccent,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Item $index',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            );
          },
          crossAxisCount: 3, // Number of columns
          childAspectRatio: 1.0, // Aspect ratio of each item
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a fixed grid of items. The `FixedGrid` widget takes care of laying out the items in a grid format.

# Complete Example of flutterzilla_fixed_grid

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutterzilla_fixed_grid/flutterzilla_fixed_grid.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Fixed Grid Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: FixedGrid(
          itemCount: 20, // Total number of items to display
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return Card(
              color: Colors.blueAccent, // Background color of each item
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Item $index', // Display item index
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20), // Text style
                ),
              ),
            );
          },
          crossAxisCount: 3, // Number of columns in the grid
          childAspectRatio: 1.0, // Aspect ratio of each grid item
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a FixedGrid widget.
// 6. The FixedGrid widget is configured with 20 items, a cross-axis count of 3, and a child aspect ratio of 1.0.
// 7. Each item in the grid is represented by a Card widget with a blue background and centered text displaying the item index.
// 8. The runApp function initializes the app and displays the RealFlutter widget.
