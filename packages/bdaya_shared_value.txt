# Overview of the bdaya_shared_value Flutter Package

The `bdaya_shared_value` package is a powerful tool for managing shared state in Flutter applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to create reactive variables that can be shared across different parts of your app. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to maintain a consistent state across multiple widgets without resorting to complex state management solutions.

## When to Use `bdaya_shared_value`

- **Global State Management**: When you need to share state across multiple widgets or screens.
- **Reactive Programming**: If you want to create reactive variables that automatically update the UI when their values change.
- **Simplifying State Management**: For small to medium-sized applications where a full-fledged state management solution might be overkill.

## Key Features

- **Reactive Variables**: Automatically notify listeners when the value changes.
- **Simple API**: Easy to use and integrate into existing Flutter applications.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead compared to other state management solutions.
- **Support for Multiple Types**: Can handle various data types, including primitives and custom objects.

Overall, `bdaya_shared_value` is an excellent choice for developers looking for a straightforward way to manage shared state in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using bdaya_shared_value

## Installation

To get started with `bdaya_shared_value`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bdaya_shared_value: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/bdaya_shared_value).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use `bdaya_shared_value`, you need to create a shared value and listen for changes. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:bdaya_shared_value/bdaya_shared_value.dart';

void main() {
  // Create a shared value
  final sharedValue = SharedValue<int>(0);

  // Listen for changes
  sharedValue.addListener(() {
    print('Value changed: ${sharedValue.value}');
  });

  // Update the value
  sharedValue.value = 1; // This will trigger the listener
}
```

In this example, we create a `SharedValue` of type `int`, listen for changes, and update the value. The listener will print the new value whenever it changes.

With this setup, you can easily manage shared state across your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of bdaya_shared_value in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bdaya_shared_value/bdaya_shared_value.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create a shared value to hold the counter
  final SharedValue<int> counter = SharedValue<int>(0);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('bdaya_shared_value Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display the current value of the counter
              ValueListenableBuilder<int>(
                valueListenable: counter,
                builder: (context, value, child) {
                  return Text(
                    'Counter: $value',
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                  );
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Button to increment the counter
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Increment the counter value
                  counter.value++;
                },
                child: Text('Increment'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. Inside RealFlutter, a SharedValue<int> named 'counter' is created and initialized to 0.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget is built, containing a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The ValueListenableBuilder listens to changes in the 'counter' value and rebuilds the Text widget whenever the value changes.
// 5. The ElevatedButton increments the counter when pressed, triggering the ValueListenableBuilder to update the displayed counter value.
```

### Summary of the Code Flow
The provided code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the `bdaya_shared_value` package to manage a counter. The `SharedValue<int>` is used to hold the counter's value, and a `ValueListenableBuilder` listens for changes to this value. When the button is pressed, the counter is incremented, and the UI updates automatically to reflect the new value. This showcases the reactive capabilities of the `bdaya_shared_value` package, making state management straightforward and efficient.
