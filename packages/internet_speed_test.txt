# Internet Speed Test Flutter Package

The `internet_speed_test` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to measure the internet speed of a device. It provides a simple and efficient way to test both download and upload speeds, as well as ping latency. This package is particularly useful for applications that require network performance monitoring, such as streaming services, gaming apps, or any application where internet speed is a critical factor.

## When to Use This Package
- **Network Performance Monitoring**: If your app relies on internet connectivity, you can use this package to inform users about their current internet speed.
- **Troubleshooting Network Issues**: Users can test their internet speed to diagnose connectivity problems.
- **Data Usage Management**: Users can monitor their internet speed to manage their data usage effectively.

## Features
- **Download Speed Measurement**: Tests how fast data can be downloaded from the internet.
- **Upload Speed Measurement**: Tests how fast data can be uploaded to the internet.
- **Ping Measurement**: Measures the latency of the connection to a server.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that can be easily integrated into any Flutter application.

With these features, the `internet_speed_test` package provides a comprehensive solution for measuring internet speed in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Internet Speed Test Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `internet_speed_test` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  internet_speed_test: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the speed test functionality.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:internet_speed_test/internet_speed_test.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `InternetSpeedTest` class and use its methods to start the speed test.

This setup will allow you to measure internet speed effectively in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Internet Speed Test Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:internet_speed_test/internet_speed_test.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of InternetSpeedTest
  final InternetSpeedTest _internetSpeedTest = InternetSpeedTest();
  String _downloadSpeed = '0';
  String _uploadSpeed = '0';
  String _ping = '0';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
  }

  // Method to start the speed test
  void startSpeedTest() {
    // Start the download speed test
    _internetSpeedTest.startDownloadTesting(
      onDone: (double downloadRate) {
        setState(() {
          _downloadSpeed = downloadRate.toStringAsFixed(2);
        });
      },
      onError: (String errorMessage) {
        print("Error: $errorMessage");
      },
    );

    // Start the upload speed test
    _internetSpeedTest.startUploadTesting(
      onDone: (double uploadRate) {
        setState(() {
          _uploadSpeed = uploadRate.toStringAsFixed(2);
        });
      },
      onError: (String errorMessage) {
        print("Error: $errorMessage");
      },
    );

    // Measure ping
    _internetSpeedTest.testPing(
      onDone: (String ping) {
        setState(() {
          _ping = ping;
        });
      },
      onError: (String errorMessage) {
        print("Error: $errorMessage");
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Internet Speed Test'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Download Speed: $_downloadSpeed Mbps'),
              Text('Upload Speed: $_uploadSpeed Mbps'),
              Text('Ping: $_ping ms'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: startSpeedTest,
                child: Text('Start Speed Test'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the internet speed test results.
// 3. In the initState method, we initialize any necessary components.
// 4. The startSpeedTest method is called when the user presses the "Start Speed Test" button.
// 5. This method initiates the download and upload speed tests and measures the ping.
// 6. The results are displayed on the screen, updating in real-time as the tests complete.
