In summary, the code flows as follows:

1. The user clicks on a link that is associated with the app.
2. The app is launched and the `UniLinks` package is initialized.
3. The `getInitialLink` method is called to get the initial link.
4. If an initial link is found, it is handled by the app.
5. The app listens for link changes using the `linkStream` property.
6. When a link change is detected, the new link is handled by the app.

This allows the app to handle deep links and provide a seamless user experience.
