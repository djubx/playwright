# Overview of the anthropic_sdk_dart Flutter Package

The `anthropic_sdk_dart` package is a Dart SDK designed to facilitate interaction with the Anthropic API, which provides advanced AI capabilities. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to integrate AI-driven features into their Flutter applications, such as natural language processing, chatbots, and other intelligent systems.

## When to Use This Package
- **AI Chatbots**: If you're building a chatbot that requires natural language understanding, this package can help you connect to the Anthropic API seamlessly.
- **Text Analysis**: For applications that need to analyze or generate text based on user input, this package provides the necessary tools.
- **Personal Assistants**: If you're developing a personal assistant app, leveraging the AI capabilities of the Anthropic API can enhance user experience.

## Key Features
- **Easy Integration**: Simplifies the process of connecting to the Anthropic API.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Supports asynchronous calls, making it suitable for Flutter's reactive programming model.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Provides mechanisms to handle errors gracefully during API interactions.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Well-documented methods and classes to help developers get started quickly.

# Setting Up and Using the anthropic_sdk_dart Package

## Installation
To use the `anthropic_sdk_dart` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  anthropic_sdk_dart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `anthropic_sdk_dart` package, you need to initialize the SDK with your API key and then make requests to the API. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
import 'package:anthropic_sdk_dart/anthropic_sdk_dart.dart';

void main() async {
  // Initialize the SDK with your API key
  final client = AnthropicClient(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');

  // Make a request to the API
  final response = await client.sendMessage('Hello, how can I help you?');

  // Print the response
  print(response);
}
```

This example demonstrates how to initialize the client and send a message to the Anthropic API. Make sure to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key.

# Complete Example of Using anthropic_sdk_dart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:anthropic_sdk_dart/anthropic_sdk_dart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Anthropic SDK Example',
      home: ChatScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ChatScreenState createState() => _ChatScreenState();
}

class _ChatScreenState extends State<ChatScreen> {
  final AnthropicClient _client = AnthropicClient(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  String _response = '';

  // Function to send a message to the Anthropic API
  Future<void> _sendMessage() async {
    // Get the user input from the text field
    final userInput = _controller.text;

    // Send the message to the API and await the response
    final apiResponse = await _client.sendMessage(userInput);

    // Update the state with the API response
    setState(() {
      _response = apiResponse;
    });

    // Clear the text field
    _controller.clear();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chat with AI'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Display the AI response
            Text(
              _response,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Text field for user input
            TextField(
              controller: _controller,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Type your message',
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            // Button to send the message
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _sendMessage,
              child: Text('Send'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// This Flutter application demonstrates how to use the anthropic_sdk_dart package to create a simple chat interface.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets the home screen to ChatScreen.
// 2. The ChatScreen widget contains a stateful widget that manages the chat interface.
// 3. The AnthropicClient is initialized with an API key.
// 4. A TextEditingController is used to capture user input from the text field.
// 5. When the user presses the "Send" button, the _sendMessage function is called.
// 6. This function retrieves the user input, sends it to the Anthropic API, and updates the UI with the response.
// 7. The response from the API is displayed above the text field, allowing for a simple chat experience.
// 
// This example provides a basic structure for integrating the anthropic_sdk_dart package into a Flutter application, showcasing its capabilities in a user-friendly manner.
