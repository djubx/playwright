# Complete Example of Using jdate in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:jdate/jdate.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Jdate Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Jalali Date Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DateDisplay(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DateDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current Gregorian date
    DateTime currentGregorianDate = DateTime.now();
    
    // Convert the current Gregorian date to Jalali
    Jalali currentJalaliDate = Jalali.fromGregorian(currentGregorianDate);
    
    // Format the Jalali date for display
    String formattedJalaliDate = currentJalaliDate.toString();

    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: <Widget>[
        Text(
          'Current Gregorian Date: ${currentGregorianDate.toLocal()}',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        Text(
          'Current Jalali Date: $formattedJalaliDate',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a centered body with the DateDisplay widget.
// 4. The DateDisplay widget retrieves the current Gregorian date and converts it to a Jalali date.
// 5. Both the current Gregorian and Jalali dates are displayed in the center of the screen.
