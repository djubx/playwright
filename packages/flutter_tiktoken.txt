# Flutter Package: flutter_tiktoken

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
## Description

The `flutter_tiktoken` package is a Flutter library designed to facilitate the integration of tokenization functionalities, particularly for applications that require processing natural language or working with large datasets. This package is particularly useful for developers working on projects that involve machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), or any application that needs to handle text data efficiently.

### When to Use

You might consider using `flutter_tiktoken` in scenarios such as:
- Building chatbots that require tokenization of user input.
- Developing applications that analyze text data for sentiment analysis or other NLP tasks.
- Creating educational tools that help users learn languages by breaking down sentences into manageable tokens.

### Features

- **Tokenization**: Efficiently splits text into tokens, which can be words, phrases, or symbols.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to define their own tokenization rules based on the application's needs.
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

## Tutorial

### Installation

To add the `flutter_tiktoken` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_tiktoken: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Basic Usage

To use the `flutter_tiktoken` package, you can start by importing it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_tiktoken/flutter_tiktoken.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and utilize its methods for tokenization:

```dart
class RealFlutter {
  void tokenizeText(String text) {
    // Create an instance of the tokenizer
    final tokenizer = Tiktoken();

    // Tokenize the input text
    final tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text);

    // Print the tokens
    print(tokens);
  }
}
```

This simple setup allows you to tokenize any string input, making it easy to integrate into your application.

## Complete Example

Hereâ€™s a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `flutter_tiktoken` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_tiktoken/flutter_tiktoken.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Tiktoken Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  List<String> _tokens = [];

  void _tokenizeInput() {
    // Create an instance of the tokenizer
    final tokenizer = Tiktoken();

    // Tokenize the input text from the controller
    final tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(_controller.text);

    // Update the state with the new tokens
    setState(() {
      _tokens = tokens;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Tokenization Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _controller,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter text to tokenize'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _tokenizeInput,
              child: Text('Tokenize'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Tokens:'),
            ..._tokens.map((token) => Text(token)).toList(),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// `MyApp` is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// The home widget is `RealFlutter`, which is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the tokenization process.
// Inside `_RealFlutterState`, a TextEditingController is created to capture user input.
// The `_tokenizeInput` method is defined to handle the tokenization process when the button is pressed.
// It creates an instance of the `Tiktoken` class and tokenizes the text from the controller.
// The resulting tokens are stored in the `_tokens` list, which triggers a UI update via `setState()`.
// The build method constructs the UI, including a TextField for input, a button to trigger tokenization, and a list to display the tokens.
// When the user enters text and presses the button, the tokens are displayed below the button.
