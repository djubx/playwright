# Flutter Triple: A Comprehensive Guide

## Overview of the flutter_triple Package

The `flutter_triple` package is a state management solution for Flutter applications that simplifies the management of application state while promoting a reactive programming model. It is built on top of the `triple` architecture, which is designed to separate concerns and enhance the maintainability of your code.

### When to Use flutter_triple

You should consider using `flutter_triple` when:
- You need a robust state management solution that is easy to implement and understand.
- Your application requires a clear separation of business logic from UI code.
- You want to leverage reactive programming principles to manage state changes efficiently.

### Key Features

- **Reactive State Management**: Automatically updates the UI when the state changes.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Encourages a clean architecture by separating UI, business logic, and data layers.
- **Built-in Error Handling**: Provides mechanisms to handle errors gracefully.
- **Support for Multiple States**: Easily manage loading, success, and error states.

With these features, `flutter_triple` helps developers create scalable and maintainable Flutter applications.

## Setting Up flutter_triple

### Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started with `flutter_triple`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_triple: ^3.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Step 4: Create Your First Triple Store

You can create a simple store by extending the `Triple` class. Here’s an example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_triple/flutter_triple.dart';

class RealFlutter extends Store<int> {
  RealFlutter() : super(0); // Initial state

  void increment() {
    update(state + 1); // Update state
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Using the Store in Your Widget

You can now use the `RealFlutter` store in your Flutter widgets. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_triple/flutter_triple.dart';

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  final RealFlutter store = RealFlutter();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Triple Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: TripleBuilder<RealFlutter, int>(
          store: store,
          builder: (context, state) {
            return Text('Counter: $state'); // Display current state
          },
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: store.increment, // Increment counter
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Conclusion

You have now set up the `flutter_triple` package in your Flutter application. This package provides a powerful way to manage state reactively, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.

## Complete Example of flutter_triple

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_triple/flutter_triple.dart';

// Step 1: Create a store class that extends Store
class RealFlutter extends Store<int> {
  RealFlutter() : super(0); // Initial state is set to 0

  // Step 2: Method to increment the state
  void increment() {
    update(state + 1); // Update the state by incrementing it
  }
}

// Step 3: Create the main application widget
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Triple Example',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// Step 4: Create the home page widget
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  final RealFlutter store = RealFlutter(); // Instantiate the store

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Triple Example')),
      body: Center(
        // Step 5: Use TripleBuilder to listen to state changes
        child: TripleBuilder<RealFlutter, int>(
          store: store,
          builder: (context, state) {
            return Text('Counter: $state'); // Display the current counter value
          },
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: store.increment, // Call the increment method on button press
        child: Icon(Icons.add), // Floating action button icon
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Step 6: Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and directs to MyHomePage.
// In MyHomePage, we create an instance of RealFlutter, which holds the state.
// The TripleBuilder listens for changes in the state and rebuilds the UI accordingly.
// When the floating action button is pressed, the increment method is called,
// which updates the state, causing the UI to reflect the new counter value.
```

### Summary of Application Flow

The application begins execution in the `main()` function, which initializes the `MyApp` widget. The `MyApp` widget sets up the `MaterialApp` and directs the user to the `MyHomePage` widget. In `MyHomePage`, an instance of `RealFlutter` is created, which manages the state of the counter. The `TripleBuilder` widget listens for changes in the state and rebuilds the UI whenever the state updates. When the user presses the floating action button, the `increment` method is called, updating the state and causing the displayed counter value to change accordingly. This flow demonstrates the reactive nature of the `flutter_triple` package, making state management straightforward and efficient.
