# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Widget Marquee

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the `widget_marquee` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  widget_marquee: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the marquee effect.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_marquee/widget_marquee.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Widget Marquee Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: WidgetMarquee(
            child: Text(
              'Welcome to the Widget Marquee package! Enjoy scrolling text!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
            direction: Axis.horizontal,
            speed: 50.0,
            loop: true,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the `WidgetMarquee` widget to display scrolling text. You can customize the speed, direction, and looping behavior as needed.

# Complete Example of Widget Marquee

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_marquee/widget_marquee.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Widget Marquee Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: WidgetMarquee(
            child: Text(
              'Welcome to the Widget Marquee package! Enjoy scrolling text!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold), // Styling the text
            ),
            direction: Axis.horizontal, // Setting the direction of the marquee
            speed: 50.0, // Speed of the scrolling text
            loop: true, // Enabling looping of the marquee
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the basic structure of the app.
3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which includes an AppBar and a Center widget.
4. The Center widget contains the WidgetMarquee widget, which is responsible for the scrolling text effect.
5. The WidgetMarquee widget takes a child widget (in this case, a Text widget) and displays it with the specified scrolling properties.
6. The text scrolls horizontally at a speed of 50.0 and loops indefinitely, providing a continuous display of the message.
