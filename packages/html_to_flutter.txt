```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:html_to_flutter/html_to_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Html to Flutter Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _htmlContent = '<h1>Hello, World!</h1>';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Html to Flutter Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Html(
          data: _htmlContent,
          // Customize the styles and layouts of the rendered HTML content
          style: {
            'h1': TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.blue),
          },
          // Handle taps on links and other interactive elements
          onTap: (url) {
            print('Tapped on $url');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, which displays a Material app with a title and a home page.
// 2. The home page is the RealFlutter widget, which is a stateful widget.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget displays a Scaffold with an app bar and a body.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child.
// 5. The child of the Center widget is an Html widget, which renders the HTML content.
// 6. The Html widget is customized with styles and layouts using the style property.
// 7. The Html widget also handles taps on links and other interactive elements using the onTap property.

// In summary, the code flows as follows:
// - The user runs the app, which displays a Material app with a title and a home page.
// - The home page displays a Scaffold with an app bar and a body.
// - The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child.
// - The child of the Center widget is an Html widget, which renders the HTML content.
// - The Html widget is customized with styles and layouts, and handles taps on links and other interactive elements.
