# Overview of the `reactive_raw_autocomplete` Flutter Package

The `reactive_raw_autocomplete` package is a powerful tool for implementing autocomplete functionality in Flutter applications. It provides a reactive approach to handling user input, making it easy to create dynamic and responsive search fields. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where users need to search through large datasets or when suggestions need to be fetched from a remote source.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `reactive_raw_autocomplete` package in the following scenarios:

- **Search Features**: When building applications that require search functionality, such as e-commerce platforms, blogs, or any app with a large dataset.
- **Dynamic Suggestions**: When you want to provide users with real-time suggestions based on their input, enhancing user experience.
- **Form Inputs**: In forms where users need to select from a list of options, this package can streamline the selection process.

## Key Features

- **Reactive Input Handling**: Automatically updates suggestions based on user input.
- **Customizable UI**: Allows developers to customize the appearance of the autocomplete dropdown.
- **Debouncing**: Reduces the number of API calls by implementing a debounce mechanism, ensuring that suggestions are fetched only after the user has stopped typing for a specified duration.
- **Integration with Streams**: Works seamlessly with Dart streams, making it easy to integrate with existing reactive programming patterns.

By leveraging these features, developers can create intuitive and efficient search experiences in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `reactive_raw_autocomplete`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `reactive_raw_autocomplete` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `reactive_raw_autocomplete` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  reactive_raw_autocomplete: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # or higher
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's implement a simple autocomplete feature.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reactive_raw_autocomplete/reactive_raw_autocomplete.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the state of the autocomplete input.

3. Use the `ReactiveRawAutocomplete` widget to implement the autocomplete functionality.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List of suggestions
  final List<String> _options = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Fig', 'Grape'];
  String? _selectedOption;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Reactive Raw Autocomplete Example')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: ReactiveRawAutocomplete<String>(
          options: _options,
          onSelected: (String value) {
            setState(() {
              _selectedOption = value; // Update the selected option
            });
          },
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            hintText: 'Start typing...',
            border: OutlineInputBorder(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic autocomplete input field that suggests fruits as the user types. 

## Step 4: Testing the Application

Run your application on an emulator or physical device to see the autocomplete feature in action. As you type in the input field, suggestions will appear based on the predefined list of options.

With these steps, you have successfully integrated the `reactive_raw_autocomplete` package into your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of `reactive_raw_autocomplete`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reactive_raw_autocomplete/reactive_raw_autocomplete.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Reactive Raw Autocomplete Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List of suggestions for the autocomplete
  final List<String> _options = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Fig', 'Grape'];
  String? _selectedOption; // Variable to hold the selected option

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Reactive Raw Autocomplete Example')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // ReactiveRawAutocomplete widget for user input
            ReactiveRawAutocomplete<String>(
              options: _options, // Providing the list of options
              onSelected: (String value) {
                setState(() {
                  _selectedOption = value; // Update the selected option
                });
              },
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                hintText: 'Start typing...',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the selected option
            Text(
              _selectedOption != null ? 'You selected: $_selectedOption' : 'No selection made',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the MaterialApp widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget to manage the state.
// 3. A list of options is defined for the autocomplete suggestions.
// 4. The ReactiveRawAutocomplete widget is used to create an input field that shows suggestions based on user input.
// 5. When a user selects an option, the onSelected callback updates the state with the selected value.
// 6. The selected option is displayed below the input field, providing immediate feedback to the user.
