# flutter_dialog_manager: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_dialog_manager`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_dialog_manager: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dialog_manager).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if your dialogs require them (e.g., internet access for network-related dialogs).

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to handle any specific permissions or settings required by your dialogs.

## Basic Usage
To use `flutter_dialog_manager`, you first need to initialize the dialog manager in your main application file. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_dialog_manager/flutter_dialog_manager.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dialog Manager Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}
```

In your `RealFlutter` class, you can create and display dialogs as follows:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dialog Manager Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a simple alert dialog
            DialogManager.showAlertDialog(
              context: context,
              title: 'Alert',
              message: 'This is an alert dialog!',
              onConfirm: () {
                // Handle confirmation action
                Navigator.of(context).pop();
              },
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Alert Dialog'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that uses the `flutter_dialog_manager` package to display an alert dialog when a button is pressed.

                    // Handle confirmation action
                    Navigator.of(context).pop();

            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Show a confirmation dialog
                DialogManager.showConfirmationDialog(
                  context: context,
                  title: 'Confirmation',
                  message: 'Are you sure you want to proceed?',
                  onConfirm: () {
                    // Handle confirmation action
                    Navigator.of(context).pop();
                  },
                  onCancel: () {
                    // Handle cancellation action
                    Navigator.of(context).pop();
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Show Confirmation Dialog'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home screen.
// 3. RealFlutter contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, there are two ElevatedButtons.
// 5. The first button shows an alert dialog when pressed, using DialogManager.showAlertDialog.
// 6. The second button shows a confirmation dialog when pressed, using DialogManager.showConfirmationDialog.
// 7. Both dialogs have onConfirm and onCancel callbacks to handle user actions and close the dialogs.
