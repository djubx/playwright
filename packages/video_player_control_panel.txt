# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Video Player Control Panel

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `video_player_control_panel` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `video_player_control_panel` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_player_control_panel: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions to allow video playback:
   ```xml
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your microphone for video recording.</string>
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera for video recording.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:video_player_control_panel/video_player_control_panel.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Control Panel

You can now use the `VideoPlayerControlPanel` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';
import 'package:video_player_control_panel/video_player_control_panel.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late VideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = VideoPlayerController.network(
      'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // Replace with your video URL
    )..initialize().then((_) {
        setState(() {}); // Update the UI after the video is initialized
      });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose(); // Dispose of the controller when done
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Video Player Control Panel')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            if (_controller.value.isInitialized)
              AspectRatio(
                aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio,
                child: VideoPlayer(_controller),
              ),
            VideoPlayerControlPanel(controller: _controller), // Control panel widget
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          setState(() {
            _controller.value.isPlaying ? _controller.pause() : _controller.play();
          });
        },
        child: Icon(
          _controller.value.isPlaying ? Icons.pause : Icons.play_arrow,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple video player application that uses the `video_player_control_panel` package to provide playback controls.

# Complete Example of Video Player Control Panel

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';
import 'package:video_player_control_panel/video_player_control_panel.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late VideoPlayerController _controller; // Declare the video player controller

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the video player controller with a video URL
    _controller = VideoPlayerController.network(
      'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // Replace with your video URL
    )..initialize().then((_) {
        setState(() {}); // Update the UI after the video is initialized
      });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose(); // Dispose of the controller when done
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Video Player Control Panel')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            if (_controller.value.isInitialized) // Check if the video is initialized
              AspectRatio(
                aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio, // Maintain aspect ratio
                child: VideoPlayer(_controller), // Video player widget
              ),
            VideoPlayerControlPanel(controller: _controller), // Control panel widget
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          setState(() {
            // Toggle play/pause on button press
            _controller.value.isPlaying ? _controller.pause() : _controller.play();
          });
        },
        child: Icon(
          _controller.value.isPlaying ? Icons.pause : Icons.play_arrow, // Change icon based on state
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. In the initState method, we initialize the VideoPlayerController with a video URL.
// 3. Once the video is initialized, we call setState to update the UI.
// 4. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the video player and control panel if the video is initialized.
// 5. The floating action button allows users to play or pause the video, updating the icon accordingly.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, we ensure to clean up the video controller to free resources.
