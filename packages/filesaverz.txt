# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Filesaverz

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Filesaverz package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  filesaverz: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to write to external storage. Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to save a text file.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:filesaverz/filesaverz.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Filesaverz Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Create a sample text to save
              String content = "Hello, Filesaverz!";
              // Save the file using Filesaverz
              await FileSaver.saveFile("example.txt", content);
              // Show a success message
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('File saved successfully!')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Save File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a text file named `example.txt` is created and saved to the device.

# Complete Example of Filesaverz in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:filesaverz/filesaverz.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Filesaverz Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Step 1: Create a sample text to save
              String content = "Hello, Filesaverz!";
              
              // Step 2: Save the file using Filesaverz
              await FileSaver.saveFile("example.txt", content);
              
              // Step 3: Show a success message
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('File saved successfully!')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Save File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. A string variable 'content' is created with the text "Hello, Filesaverz!".
// 6. The FileSaver.saveFile method is called to save the content as 'example.txt'.
// 7. After saving, a SnackBar is displayed to inform the user that the file has been saved successfully.
```
