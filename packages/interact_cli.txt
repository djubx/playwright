# Overview of the interact_cli Flutter Package

The `interact_cli` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to create interactive command-line interfaces (CLI) within their applications. This package allows developers to build user-friendly command-line tools that can enhance the functionality of their Flutter apps, especially for those that require user input or command execution.

## When to Use `interact_cli`
- **Command-Line Tools**: When you need to create a command-line interface for your Flutter application.
- **Interactive Scripts**: For applications that require user interaction through the terminal.
- **Debugging**: To facilitate debugging processes by allowing developers to run commands and see outputs directly in the terminal.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Prompts**: Easily create prompts for user input.
- **Command Execution**: Execute commands and display results in real-time.
- **Customizable UI**: Tailor the command-line interface to fit your application's needs.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

The `interact_cli` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with interactive command-line capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `interact_cli`

## Installation
To add the `interact_cli` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  interact_cli: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if your CLI interacts with system features. Typically, no additional configuration is required for basic CLI functionality.

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to adjust your `Info.plist` file to allow for terminal interactions, especially if your app requires specific permissions.

## Basic Usage
To use the `interact_cli` package, you will need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:interact_cli/interact_cli.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and start building your command-line interface.

### Example Code Snippet
```dart
void main() {
  final cli = RealFlutter();
  cli.start();
}
```

This simple setup initializes the CLI and starts listening for user commands. You can expand this by adding more interactive features as needed.

# Complete Example of `interact_cli`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:interact_cli/interact_cli.dart';

void main() {
  // Create an instance of the RealFlutter class
  final cli = RealFlutter();
  
  // Start the command-line interface
  cli.start();
}

class RealFlutter {
  // Method to start the CLI
  void start() {
    // Display a welcome message
    print("Welcome to the RealFlutter CLI!");
    
    // Prompt the user for input
    String? command = promptUser("Please enter a command:");

    // Process the command
    processCommand(command);
  }

  // Method to prompt the user for input
  String? promptUser(String message) {
    print(message);
    // Simulate user input (in a real scenario, this would be dynamic)
    return "exampleCommand"; // Replace with actual user input handling
  }

  // Method to process the user's command
  void processCommand(String? command) {
    if (command == "exampleCommand") {
      print("You entered the example command!");
      // Add more command processing logic here
    } else {
      print("Unknown command: $command");
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the RealFlutter class and starts the CLI.
// 2. The start method displays a welcome message and prompts the user for a command.
// 3. The promptUser method simulates user input and returns a command string.
// 4. The processCommand method checks the command and executes the corresponding logic.
// 5. If the command is recognized, it processes it; otherwise, it informs the user of an unknown command.

### Summary of the Code Flow
The provided code initializes a simple command-line interface using the `interact_cli` package. The `RealFlutter` class manages the CLI's lifecycle, starting with a welcome message and prompting the user for input. The user input is processed to execute commands, demonstrating how to handle user interactions effectively. This structure can be expanded to include more complex command handling and features as needed.
