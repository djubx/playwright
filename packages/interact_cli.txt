// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user presses the "Run CLI Command" button.
// 2. The `_cli.run()` method is called with the `my_command` command and the `--help` option.
// 3. The `MyCommand` class is instantiated and the `run()` method is called.
// 4. The `ArgParser` class is used to parse the arguments and options.
// 5. If the `--help` option is present, the help message is printed.
// 6. Otherwise, the "My command ran!" message is printed.

// The output of the CLI command is captured and printed to the console.
