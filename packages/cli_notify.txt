The `cli_notify` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement command-line interface notifications in their applications. This package allows developers to send notifications directly to the command line, making it easier to debug and monitor application states during development.

## When to Use `cli_notify`

- **Debugging**: When you want to log messages or notifications directly to the console while developing your Flutter application.
- **Monitoring**: For applications that require real-time feedback in the command line, such as CLI tools or server applications.
- **User Feedback**: To provide immediate feedback to users in a command-line environment.

## Features

- **Simple API**: Easy to use with a straightforward API for sending notifications.
- **Customizable Notifications**: Allows customization of notification messages and styles.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using CLI Notify

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `cli_notify`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cli_notify: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:cli_notify/cli_notify.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. You may need to add the following permissions if your notifications require internet access or other features:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your app's `Info.plist` to allow notifications. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Step 4: Using CLI Notify

You can now use the `cli_notify` package in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to send a notification:

```dart
void main() {
  // Initialize the CLI Notify
  RealFlutter.notify('Hello, CLI Notify!');
}
```

This will send a notification to the command line when the application runs.

## Step 5: Customizing Notifications

You can customize your notifications by using different styles and messages. For example:

```dart
RealFlutter.notify('This is a warning!', style: NotifyStyle.warning);
```

This will display a warning notification in the command line.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `cli_notify` package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of CLI Notify

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cli_notify/cli_notify.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'CLI Notify Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('CLI Notify Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Sending a simple notification
              RealFlutter.notify('Button Pressed! Notification sent.');
            },
            child: Text('Send Notification'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback.
// 6. Inside the callback, RealFlutter.notify() is called to send a notification to the command line.
// 7. The notification message "Button Pressed! Notification sent." will appear in the command line.
```
