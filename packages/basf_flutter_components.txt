# Complete Example of basf_flutter_components

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:basf_flutter_components/basf_flutter_components.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Basf Flutter Components Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Using a BasfButton from the package
            BasfButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Hello!'),
                    content: Text('You clicked the button!'),
                    actions: <Widget>[
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () {
                          Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                        },
                        child: Text('Close'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Click Me'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between components
            // Using a BasfCard from the package
            BasfCard(
              child: Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                child: Text('This is a card component!'),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 4. HomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the BasfButton and BasfCard vertically.
// 6. When the BasfButton is pressed, an AlertDialog is shown with a message and a close button.
// 7. The BasfCard displays a simple text message, demonstrating the use of card components.
