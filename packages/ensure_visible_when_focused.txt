<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Ensure Visible When Focused Flutter Package

The `ensure_visible_when_focused` package is a Flutter utility designed to enhance user experience by ensuring that focused widgets remain visible within the viewport. This is particularly useful in scenarios where users interact with forms or input fields, and the keyboard may obscure the focused widget. 

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using this package in the following scenarios:

- **Forms**: When building forms with multiple input fields, ensuring that the currently focused field is visible can prevent user frustration.
- **Chat Applications**: In chat apps where users type messages, keeping the input field visible while the keyboard is open is crucial for usability.
- **Dynamic Content**: In applications where content changes dynamically, ensuring that the focused widget remains in view can enhance the user experience.

## Features

- **Automatic Scrolling**: Automatically scrolls the focused widget into view when the keyboard appears.
- **Customizable Behavior**: Allows developers to customize the scrolling behavior and animation.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

By integrating this package into your Flutter application, you can significantly improve the usability of forms and input fields, leading to a smoother user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Ensure Visible When Focused Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `ensure_visible_when_focused` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ensure_visible_when_focused: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:ensure_visible_when_focused/ensure_visible_when_focused.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Wrap your input fields with the `EnsureVisibleWhenFocused` widget. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
EnsureVisibleWhenFocused(
  child: TextField(
    decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your text'),
  ),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the following configuration to support soft input mode:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
</activity>
```

This setting allows the layout to resize when the keyboard appears, ensuring that the focused widget is visible.

#### iOS

For iOS, no additional configuration is typically required. The package should work out of the box, but ensure that your app's layout is responsive to keyboard events.

## Step 4: Customizing Behavior

You can customize the scrolling behavior by providing parameters to the `EnsureVisibleWhenFocused` widget. For example:

```dart
EnsureVisibleWhenFocused(
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
  curve: Curves.easeInOut,
  child: TextField(
    decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your text'),
  ),
)
```

This allows you to control the animation duration and curve when the widget is scrolled into view.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate the `ensure_visible_when_focused` package into your Flutter application, enhancing the user experience when interacting with input fields.

# Complete Example of Using Ensure Visible When Focused

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ensure_visible_when_focused/ensure_visible_when_focused.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ensure Visible When Focused Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Ensure Visible When Focused'),
        ),
        body: MyForm(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyForm extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SingleChildScrollView(
      child: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Each TextField is wrapped with EnsureVisibleWhenFocused
            EnsureVisibleWhenFocused(
              child: TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'First Name'),
              ),
            ),
            EnsureVisibleWhenFocused(
              child: TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Last Name'),
              ),
            ),
            EnsureVisibleWhenFocused(
              child: TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
              ),
            ),
            EnsureVisibleWhenFocused(
              child: TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Phone Number'),
              ),
            ),
            // A submit button to complete the form
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Handle form submission
                print('Form submitted');
              },
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold containing an AppBar and the MyForm widget.
// 3. MyForm is a StatelessWidget that builds a SingleChildScrollView to allow scrolling when the keyboard appears.
// 4. Each TextField is wrapped in the EnsureVisibleWhenFocused widget, ensuring that it remains visible when focused.
// 5. The form includes a submit button that prints a message to the console when pressed.
// 6. The layout is responsive, and the keyboard will not obscure the focused input fields, enhancing user experience.
