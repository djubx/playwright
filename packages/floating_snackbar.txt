Here's a detailed technical blog on the "floating_snackbar" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Floating Snackbar Flutter Package

The **floating_snackbar** package is a Flutter library that provides a customizable and visually appealing snackbar widget that can float above other UI elements. Unlike the traditional snackbar, which appears at the bottom of the screen, the floating snackbar can be positioned anywhere on the screen, allowing for greater flexibility in UI design.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the floating_snackbar package in scenarios such as:
- When you want to provide feedback to users without obstructing the main content.
- When you need to display messages that require user interaction, such as undo actions or confirmations.
- When you want to enhance the visual appeal of your application with a modern snackbar design.

## Features

- **Customizable Positioning**: You can position the snackbar at various locations on the screen.
- **Animation Support**: The package includes smooth animations for showing and hiding the snackbar.
- **Action Buttons**: You can add action buttons to the snackbar for user interactions.
- **Theming**: The snackbar can be styled to match your app's theme.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Floating Snackbar

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the floating_snackbar package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  floating_snackbar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Floating Snackbar

To use the floating snackbar in your application, follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:floating_snackbar/floating_snackbar.dart';
```

2. Create a function to show the snackbar:

```dart
void showFloatingSnackbar(BuildContext context) {
  FloatingSnackbar.show(
    context,
    message: 'This is a floating snackbar!',
    duration: Duration(seconds: 3),
    action: SnackBarAction(
      label: 'Undo',
      onPressed: () {
        // Handle the action
      },
    ),
  );
}
```

3. Call this function from a button or any other widget:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () => showFloatingSnackbar(context),
  child: Text('Show Snackbar'),
)
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate the floating snackbar into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Floating Snackbar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:floating_snackbar/floating_snackbar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Floating Snackbar Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Floating Snackbar Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () => showFloatingSnackbar(context),
            child: Text('Show Floating Snackbar'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to show the floating snackbar
  void showFloatingSnackbar(BuildContext context) {
    FloatingSnackbar.show(
      context,
      message: 'This is a floating snackbar!',
      duration: Duration(seconds: 3),
      action: SnackBarAction(
        label: 'Undo',
        onPressed: () {
          // Handle the undo action
          print('Undo action pressed');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it calls the showFloatingSnackbar function.
// 5. The showFloatingSnackbar function displays the floating snackbar with a message and an action button.
// 6. The snackbar appears for 3 seconds and can be dismissed by the user or automatically after the duration.
// 7. If the action button is pressed, it executes the onPressed callback, which currently prints a message to the console.
```
