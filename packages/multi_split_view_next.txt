# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Multi Split View Next

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `multi_split_view_next` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multi_split_view_next: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:multi_split_view_next/multi_split_view_next.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup

You can create a basic multi-split view by using the `MultiSplitView` widget. Here’s how to set it up:

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the MultiSplitView Widget

Here’s a simple example of how to use the `MultiSplitView` widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multi_split_view_next/multi_split_view_next.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Multi Split View Example')),
        body: MultiSplitView(
          children: [
            Container(color: Colors.red, child: Center(child: Text('Pane 1'))),
            Container(color: Colors.green, child: Center(child: Text('Pane 2'))),
            Container(color: Colors.blue, child: Center(child: Text('Pane 3'))),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **MultiSplitView**: This widget takes a list of children, which are the panes you want to display.
- **Container**: Each pane is wrapped in a `Container` widget, which allows you to customize its appearance.

With this setup, you can run your application, and you will see three resizable panes displayed side by side.

# Complete Example of Multi Split View Next

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multi_split_view_next/multi_split_view_next.dart';

// Main application class
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Multi Split View Example')),
        body: MultiSplitView(
          // Define the children of the MultiSplitView
          children: [
            // First pane with red background
            Container(
              color: Colors.red,
              child: Center(child: Text('Pane 1')),
            ),
            // Second pane with green background
            Container(
              color: Colors.green,
              child: Center(child: Text('Pane 2')),
            ),
            // Third pane with blue background
            Container(
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(child: Text('Pane 3')),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the basic structure for the app.
3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which includes an AppBar and a body.
4. The body contains a MultiSplitView widget, which is responsible for displaying multiple panes.
5. Each pane is defined as a Container with a specific background color and centered text.
6. When the app runs, users can see three resizable panes, each displaying different content.
7. Users can interact with the panes, resizing them as needed to customize their view.
