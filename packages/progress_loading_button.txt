Here's a detailed technical blog on the "progress_loading_button" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Progress Loading Button Flutter Package

The `progress_loading_button` package is a Flutter widget that provides a customizable button with a loading indicator. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to give users feedback during long-running operations, such as form submissions or data fetching. Instead of a static button, the `progress_loading_button` allows you to show a loading spinner while the operation is in progress, enhancing the user experience.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `progress_loading_button` package in the following scenarios:

- **Form Submissions**: When users submit forms, you can show a loading state to indicate that their request is being processed.
- **Data Fetching**: If your app fetches data from an API, you can use this button to indicate that the data is being loaded.
- **Long-Running Tasks**: For any operation that takes time, such as file uploads or downloads, this button can provide visual feedback.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: You can customize the button's text, color, and loading indicator.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is easy to integrate into existing Flutter applications.
- **Responsive Design**: The button adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Progress Loading Button

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `progress_loading_button` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  progress_loading_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:progress_loading_button/progress_loading_button.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Button

You can now use the `ProgressLoadingButton` widget in your application. Below is an example of how to implement it in a simple Flutter app.

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
  
  ```gradle
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

## Step 4: Customizing the Button

You can customize the button's appearance by modifying its properties. For example:

```dart
ProgressLoadingButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Your onPressed logic here
  },
  text: 'Submit',
  loadingText: 'Submitting...',
  color: Colors.blue,
  loadingColor: Colors.green,
)
```

This customization allows you to set different texts for the button's normal and loading states, as well as the colors for both states.

# Complete Example of Progress Loading Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:progress_loading_button/progress_loading_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Progress Loading Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Progress Loading Button Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: MyLoadingButton(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyLoadingButton extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyLoadingButtonState createState() => _MyLoadingButtonState();
}

class _MyLoadingButtonState extends State<MyLoadingButton> {
  bool _isLoading = false; // State variable to track loading status

  // Function to simulate a network call
  Future<void> _submit() async {
    setState(() {
      _isLoading = true; // Set loading state to true
    });

    // Simulate a network call with a delay
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));

    setState(() {
      _isLoading = false; // Reset loading state after completion
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ProgressLoadingButton(
      onPressed: _isLoading ? null : _submit, // Disable button if loading
      text: 'Submit',
      loadingText: 'Submitting...',
      color: Colors.blue,
      loadingColor: Colors.green,
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds MyLoadingButton.
// 4. MyLoadingButton is a StatefulWidget that manages its loading state.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the _submit function is called.
// 6. The _submit function sets the loading state to true and simulates a network call with a 2-second delay.
// 7. After the delay, the loading state is reset to false, allowing the button to be pressed again.
```

// The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget. 
// The `RealFlutter` widget builds a `MaterialApp` containing a `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a centered `MyLoadingButton` widget.
// The `MyLoadingButton` widget is a stateful widget that manages its loading state with a boolean variable `_isLoading`.
// When the button is pressed, it triggers the `_submit` function, which sets `_isLoading` to true, simulating a network call with a 2-second delay.
// After the delay, `_isLoading` is set back to false, allowing the button to be pressed again, thus providing a seamless user experience.
