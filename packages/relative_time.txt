# Overview of the `relative_time` Flutter Package

The `relative_time` package in Flutter is a powerful tool designed to simplify the display of time in a human-readable format. It allows developers to present dates and times in a way that is more relatable to users, such as "5 minutes ago," "2 days ago," or "in 3 hours." This package is particularly useful in applications that deal with timestamps, such as social media apps, messaging platforms, or any application that requires time-sensitive information.

## When to Use

You should consider using the `relative_time` package when:
- You want to enhance user experience by providing time in a more understandable format.
- Your application displays timestamps from various sources (e.g., databases, APIs) and you want to standardize the format.
- You need to handle time zones and ensure that the displayed time is relevant to the user's context.

## Features

- **Human-Readable Format**: Converts timestamps into a format that is easy to understand.
- **Localization Support**: Supports multiple languages, making it suitable for international applications.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to customize the output format based on their needs.

In summary, the `relative_time` package is an essential tool for any Flutter developer looking to improve the way time is presented in their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `relative_time` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `relative_time` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  relative_time: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `relative_time` package:

```dart
import 'package:relative_time/relative_time.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### Basic Usage

You can use the `RelativeTime` class to convert a `DateTime` object into a relative time string. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
DateTime now = DateTime.now();
DateTime pastDate = now.subtract(Duration(minutes: 5));
String relativeTime = RelativeTime().timeAgo(pastDate);
print(relativeTime); // Output: "5 minutes ago"
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customization

You can customize the output format by using different methods provided by the `RelativeTime` class. For example, you can specify the locale or customize the time units.

```dart
String customRelativeTime = RelativeTime().timeAgo(pastDate, locale: 'fr');
print(customRelativeTime); // Output: "il y a 5 minutes" (in French)
```

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `relative_time` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the `relative_time` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:relative_time/relative_time.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Relative Time Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Relative Time Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RelativeTimeDisplay(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RelativeTimeDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current time
    DateTime now = DateTime.now();
    
    // Create a past date for demonstration
    DateTime pastDate = now.subtract(Duration(hours: 2, minutes: 30));
    
    // Create an instance of RelativeTime
    RelativeTime relativeTime = RelativeTime();
    
    // Get the relative time string
    String timeAgo = relativeTime.timeAgo(pastDate);
    
    return Text(
      timeAgo,
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the RelativeTimeDisplay widget.
// 4. In RelativeTimeDisplay, the current time is fetched, and a past date is created by subtracting 2 hours and 30 minutes from the current time.
// 5. An instance of RelativeTime is created to convert the past date into a human-readable format.
// 6. Finally, the relative time string is displayed in a Text widget.
