# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Hold On Pop

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **hold_on_pop** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **hold_on_pop** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hold_on_pop: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/hold_on_pop).

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:hold_on_pop/hold_on_pop.dart';
```

## Step 3: Implementing Hold On Pop

To use the **hold_on_pop** functionality, wrap your widget with the `HoldOnPop` widget. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
HoldOnPop(
  onWillPop: () async {
    // Show a confirmation dialog
    return await showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
        title: Text('Are you sure?'),
        content: Text('Do you really want to leave this page?'),
        actions: [
          TextButton(
            onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(false),
            child: Text('No'),
          ),
          TextButton(
            onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(true),
            child: Text('Yes'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ) ?? false; // Return false if dialog is dismissed
  },
  child: YourWidget(), // Replace with your actual widget
);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` if you are using any features that require them.
- **iOS**: Make sure to test the dialog on an actual device, as the behavior may differ in the simulator.

## Step 4: Testing

Run your application and navigate to the screen where you implemented the **hold_on_pop** functionality. Try to pop the screen, and you should see the confirmation dialog appear.

By following these steps, you can effectively implement the **hold_on_pop** package in your Flutter application, enhancing user experience and preventing accidental navigation.

# Complete Example of Hold On Pop

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hold_on_pop/hold_on_pop.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Hold On Pop Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return HoldOnPop(
      onWillPop: () async {
        // Show a confirmation dialog when the user tries to pop the screen
        return await showDialog(
          context: context,
          builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
            title: Text('Are you sure?'),
            content: Text('Do you really want to leave this page?'),
            actions: [
              TextButton(
                onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(false), // User chooses not to leave
                child: Text('No'),
              ),
              TextButton(
                onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(true), // User confirms to leave
                child: Text('Yes'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ) ?? false; // Return false if dialog is dismissed
      },
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Hold On Pop Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Press back to see the confirmation dialog.'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 3. The HoldOnPop widget wraps the Scaffold, intercepting the back button press.
// 4. When the user attempts to pop the screen, the onWillPop callback is triggered.
// 5. A confirmation dialog is shown, asking the user if they really want to leave.
// 6. If the user selects 'No', the dialog closes, and the user remains on the screen.
// 7. If the user selects 'Yes', the dialog closes, and the screen is popped, navigating back to the previous screen.
