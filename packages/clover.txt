# Clover Flutter Package Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Clover package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the Clover package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  clover: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Clover requires at least API level 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Initialize Clover

In your main application file, initialize the Clover SDK. You will need your Clover merchant ID and other credentials, which you can obtain from your Clover account.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:clover/clover.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Clover Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Using Clover in Your App

You can now use the Clover package to handle payments. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate a payment:

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Clover Payment Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Initialize Clover
            Clover clover = Clover(merchantId: 'YOUR_MERCHANT_ID');
            // Start payment process
            var result = await clover.processPayment(amount: 1000); // Amount in cents
            // Handle payment result
            if (result.success) {
              print('Payment successful: ${result.transactionId}');
            } else {
              print('Payment failed: ${result.errorMessage}');
            }
          },
          child: Text('Pay $10.00'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application that allows users to make a payment of $10.00 using the Clover payment processing system.

# Complete Example of Clover Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:clover/clover.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Clover Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Clover Payment Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Initialize Clover with your merchant ID
            Clover clover = Clover(merchantId: 'YOUR_MERCHANT_ID');
            // Start the payment process
            var result = await clover.processPayment(amount: 1000); // Amount in cents
            // Check if the payment was successful
            if (result.success) {
              // Payment was successful, handle the transaction ID
              print('Payment successful: ${result.transactionId}');
            } else {
              // Payment failed, handle the error message
              print('Payment failed: ${result.errorMessage}');
            }
          },
          child: Text('Pay $10.00'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 3. A button is presented to the user to initiate a payment of $10.00.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the Clover SDK is initialized with the merchant ID.
// 5. The processPayment method is called with the amount specified in cents (1000 cents = $10.00).
// 6. The result of the payment process is checked for success or failure.
// 7. If successful, the transaction ID is printed; if failed, the error message is printed.
```
