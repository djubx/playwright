# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Awesome Card

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the awesome_card package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  awesome_card: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the awesome_card, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:awesome_card/awesome_card.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Awesome Card

You can now use the `AwesomeCard` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a card:

```dart
AwesomeCard(
  cardType: CardType.basic,
  color: Colors.blue,
  title: 'User Profile',
  subtitle: 'Flutter Developer',
  icon: Icons.person,
  // Add more properties as needed
)
```

This will create a basic user profile card with a blue background, a title, a subtitle, and an icon.
