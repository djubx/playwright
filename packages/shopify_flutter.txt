# Setting Up `shopify_flutter`

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the setup process for the `shopify_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine.
- A Shopify store with API access enabled.

## Installation

Add the `shopify_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  shopify_flutter: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

1. **Permissions**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` includes the necessary permissions for internet access.
   
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **ProGuard**: If using ProGuard, ensure that your configuration allows for the package's classes to be retained.

### iOS

1. **Info.plist**: Update your `Info.plist` to allow network access.

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Podfile**: Ensure your `Podfile` is set up to use the latest iOS platform.

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '11.0'
   ```

## Basic Usage

1. **Initialize the Package**: Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class with your Shopify store credentials.

   ```dart
   final shopify = RealFlutter(
     storeUrl: 'your-store.myshopify.com',
     accessToken: 'your-access-token',
   );
   ```

2. **Fetch Products**: Use the package to fetch and display products.

   ```dart
   Future<void> fetchProducts() async {
     final products = await shopify.getProducts();
     // Handle the list of products
   }
   ```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shopify_flutter/shopify_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Shopify Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ProductListScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ProductListScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ProductListScreenState createState() => _ProductListScreenState();
}

class _ProductListScreenState extends State<ProductListScreen> {
  final RealFlutter shopify = RealFlutter(
    storeUrl: 'your-store.myshopify.com',
    accessToken: 'your-access-token',
  );

  List<Product> _products = [];
  bool _isLoading = true;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchProducts();
  }

  Future<void> _fetchProducts() async {
    try {
      // Fetch products from Shopify
      final products = await shopify.getProducts();
      setState(() {
        _products = products;
        _isLoading = false;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle errors
      setState(() {
        _isLoading = false;
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Shopify Products'),
      ),
      body: _isLoading
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator())
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: _products.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                final product = _products[index];
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(product.title),
                  subtitle: Text('\$${product.price}'),
                  onTap: () {
                    // Navigate to product details
                  },
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app starts with the `MyApp` widget, which sets up the MaterialApp and the home screen.
// 2. The `ProductListScreen` is the main screen that displays a list of products.
// 3. In the `initState` method, `_fetchProducts` is called to load products from Shopify.
// 4. The `RealFlutter` instance is used to interact with the Shopify API.
// 5. Products are fetched and stored in the `_products` list, and the loading state is updated.
// 6. The UI displays a loading indicator while products are being fetched.
// 7. Once products are loaded, a ListView displays each product with its title and price.
// 8. Tapping on a product can be used to navigate to a detailed view (not implemented in this example).
