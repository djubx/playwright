# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Faded Widget

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **faded_widget** package, you first need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  faded_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:faded_widget/faded_widget.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Faded Widget

You can now use the `FadedWidget` in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
FadedWidget(
  duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Set the duration for the fade effect
  child: Text('Hello, Faded World!'), // The widget to apply the fade effect
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities. However, the **faded_widget** package does not require any special permissions.

## Step 4: Optimizations

To optimize the performance of your application when using the **faded_widget**, consider the following:
- Use the `FadedWidget` only for widgets that require fading effects to avoid unnecessary performance overhead.
- Test the fade duration to find a balance between visual appeal and performance.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate and use the **faded_widget** package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Faded Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:faded_widget/faded_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Faded Widget Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Faded Widget Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Faded widget with a text child
              FadedWidget(
                duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the fade effect
                child: Text(
                  'Fading Text',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between widgets
              // Faded widget with an icon child
              FadedWidget(
                duration: Duration(seconds: 3), // Different duration for effect
                child: Icon(
                  Icons.star,
                  size: 50,
                  color: Colors.amber,
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Faded Widget Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, two FadedWidget instances are created:
//    - The first FadedWidget contains a Text widget that fades in over 2 seconds.
//    - The second FadedWidget contains an Icon widget that fades in over 3 seconds.
// 6. The Column is centered, and the widgets are spaced apart using SizedBox.
// 7. The fade effect draws attention to the text and icon, enhancing the user experience.
