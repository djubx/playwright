# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Expandable Slider

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **expandable_slider** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  expandable_slider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:expandable_slider/expandable_slider.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Expandable Slider
You can now use the `ExpandableSlider` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ExpandableSlider(
  title: Text("Expandable Title"),
  content: Text("This is the content that will be shown when expanded."),
  initiallyExpanded: false,
)
```

This will create a basic expandable slider. You can customize it further by adjusting properties like `title`, `content`, and `initiallyExpanded`.

# Complete Example of Expandable Slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:expandable_slider/expandable_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Expandable Slider Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Expandable Slider Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            children: [
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adds space at the top
              // Create an expandable slider
              ExpandableSlider(
                title: Text("Click to Expand"),
                content: Column(
                  children: [
                    Text("This is the expanded content."),
                    SizedBox(height: 10), // Adds space between texts
                    Text("You can add more widgets here."),
                  ],
                ),
                initiallyExpanded: false, // Set to true to start expanded
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the widgets vertically.
// 5. A SizedBox is added for spacing, followed by the ExpandableSlider widget.
// 6. The ExpandableSlider has a title and content that expands when clicked.
// 7. The content can include multiple widgets, allowing for a rich user experience.
