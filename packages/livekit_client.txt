# Tutorial: Setting Up LiveKit Client in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **livekit_client** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **livekit_client** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  livekit_client: ^0.1.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest version
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'org.webrtc:google-webrtc:1.0.32006' // Add WebRTC dependency
}
```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio calls.</string>
```

2. Ensure you have the correct deployment target in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '12.0' # or latest version
```

## Step 3: Initialize LiveKit Client

In your Flutter application, you can initialize the LiveKit client and connect to a room. Here’s a basic example of how to do this:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:livekit_client/livekit_client.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late LiveKitClient client;
  late Room room;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    connectToRoom();
  }

  Future<void> connectToRoom() async {
    // Initialize the LiveKit client with your server URL and token
    client = LiveKitClient('wss://your-livekit-server-url', 'your-access-token');
    
    // Connect to the room
    room = await client.connect('room-name');
    
    // Listen for participants joining the room
    room.onParticipantConnected = (participant) {
      print('Participant connected: ${participant.identity}');
    };
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('LiveKit Client Example')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Connected to LiveKit Room')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the LiveKit client, connects to a specified room, and listens for participants joining the room.

# Complete Example: LiveKit Client in Flutter

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application using the **livekit_client** package. This example demonstrates connecting to a LiveKit room and handling participant events.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:livekit_client/livekit_client.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late LiveKitClient client; // Declare the LiveKit client
  late Room room; // Declare the room variable

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    connectToRoom(); // Call the method to connect to the room
  }

  Future<void> connectToRoom() async {
    // Initialize the LiveKit client with your server URL and token
    client = LiveKitClient('wss://your-livekit-server-url', 'your-access-token');
    
    // Connect to the room
    room = await client.connect('room-name');
    
    // Listen for participants joining the room
    room.onParticipantConnected = (participant) {
      print('Participant connected: ${participant.identity}');
    };

    // Listen for participants leaving the room
    room.onParticipantDisconnected = (participant) {
      print('Participant disconnected: ${participant.identity}');
    };
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('LiveKit Client Example')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Connected to LiveKit Room')),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. In the initState method, connectToRoom() is called to establish a connection to the LiveKit server.
// 3. The LiveKitClient is initialized with the server URL and access token.
// 4. The application connects to a specified room and listens for participant events.
// 5. When a participant connects or disconnects, a message is printed to the console.
// 6. The UI displays a simple message indicating that the application is connected to the LiveKit room.
```

In this example, we have a simple Flutter application that connects to a LiveKit room. The application listens for participant events and prints messages to the console when participants connect or disconnect.

### Summary of Application Flow

// 1. The application starts and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. In the initState method, connectToRoom() is called to establish a connection to the LiveKit server.
// 3. The LiveKitClient is initialized with the server URL and access token.
// 4. The application connects to a specified room and listens for participant events.
// 5. When a participant connects or disconnects, a message is printed to the console.
// 6. The UI displays a simple message indicating that the application is connected to the LiveKit room.
