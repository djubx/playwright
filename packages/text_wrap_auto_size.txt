# Setting Up and Using the `text_wrap_auto_size` Package

## Installation
To get started with the `text_wrap_auto_size` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  text_wrap_auto_size: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/text_wrap_auto_size).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `text_wrap_auto_size` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:text_wrap_auto_size/text_wrap_auto_size.dart';
```

You can then use the `TextWrapAutoSize` widget in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
TextWrapAutoSize(
  text: 'This is a sample text that will automatically wrap and resize based on the available space.',
  minFontSize: 12,
  maxFontSize: 24,
  maxLines: 3,
)
```

This widget will ensure that the text fits within the constraints of its parent widget, resizing the font size as necessary.

# Complete Example of Using `text_wrap_auto_size`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_wrap_auto_size/text_wrap_auto_size.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Text Wrap Auto Size Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Text Wrap Auto Size Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: TextWrapAutoSize(
              text: 'This is a sample text that will automatically wrap and resize based on the available space. '
                     'It is designed to demonstrate how the text can adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.',
              minFontSize: 12, // Minimum font size
              maxFontSize: 24, // Maximum font size
              maxLines: 3,     // Maximum number of lines
              textAlign: TextAlign.center, // Center align the text
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the text_wrap_auto_size package.
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Text Wrap Auto Size Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. A Padding widget is used to add space around the TextWrapAutoSize widget.
// 6. The TextWrapAutoSize widget is configured with a sample text, minimum and maximum font sizes, maximum lines, and center alignment.
// 7. The text will automatically resize and wrap based on the available space, ensuring a responsive design.
```
