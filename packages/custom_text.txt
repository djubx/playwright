# Custom Text Flutter Package: An Overview

The `custom_text` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to enhance text rendering capabilities in Flutter applications. It provides developers with the flexibility to customize text styles dynamically, apply rich text formatting, and handle complex text layouts with ease. This package is particularly useful when you need to display text with varying styles, such as in chat applications, news feeds, or any app that requires dynamic text styling.

## When to Use the Custom Text Package

- **Dynamic Text Styling**: When your application requires text to be styled dynamically based on user input or data from a server.
- **Rich Text Formatting**: For applications that need to display text with multiple styles, such as bold, italic, or underlined text within the same paragraph.
- **Complex Layouts**: When dealing with text that needs to be laid out in a non-linear fashion, such as text wrapping around images or other widgets.

## Key Features

- **Flexible Styling**: Apply different styles to different parts of a text string.
- **Rich Text Support**: Easily integrate rich text features without complex code.
- **Performance Optimized**: Designed to handle large volumes of text efficiently.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Setting Up and Using the Custom Text Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `custom_text` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `custom_text` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     custom_text: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package to start using it.

   ```dart
   import 'package:custom_text/custom_text.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support all features of the package.

  ```gradle
  android {
      defaultConfig {
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

### iOS

- Make sure your iOS deployment target is set to 11.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`.

  ```ruby
  platform :ios, '11.0'
  ```

## Using the Package

To use the `custom_text` package, you can create a `RealFlutter` widget that allows you to define text with multiple styles. Here's a simple example:

```dart
RealFlutter(
  text: 'Hello, [bold]World![/bold] This is [italic]custom text[/italic].',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
  customTextStyles: {
    'bold': TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
    'italic': TextStyle(fontStyle: FontStyle.italic),
  },
)
```

In this example, the text "World!" will be bold, and "custom text" will be italicized.

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `custom_text` package. This example demonstrates how to implement and utilize the package's features effectively.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_text/custom_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom Text Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// Home page widget
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Custom Text Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: RealFlutter(
          text: 'Welcome to [bold]RealFlutter[/bold]! Enjoy [italic]custom text[/italic] styling.',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
          customTextStyles: {
            'bold': TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            'italic': TextStyle(fontStyle: FontStyle.italic),
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// Explanation of Application Flow
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by calling `runApp` with `MyApp`.
// 2. `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is `MyHomePage`, which is another stateless widget.
// 4. `MyHomePage` builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a `RealFlutter` widget is used to display styled text.
// 6. The `RealFlutter` widget takes a text string with embedded style tags and a map of styles.
// 7. The text "RealFlutter" is bold, and "custom text" is italicized, demonstrating the package's capabilities.
