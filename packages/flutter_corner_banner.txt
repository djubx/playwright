# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_corner_banner

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_corner_banner` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_corner_banner: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a corner banner.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_corner_banner/flutter_corner_banner.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that uses the `CornerBanner` class:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Corner Banner Example')),
        body: Stack(
          children: [
            Center(child: Text('Main Content Here')),
            CornerBanner(
              position: BannerPosition.topRight,
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.red,
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                child: Text(
                  'Special Offer!',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 16),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a corner banner positioned at the top right of the screen. The banner displays a promotional message.

## Step 4: Running the Application

To run your application, use the following command:

```bash
flutter run
```

You should see your main content with a corner banner displayed in the specified position.

With these steps, you have successfully integrated the `flutter_corner_banner` package into your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of flutter_corner_banner

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_corner_banner/flutter_corner_banner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Corner Banner Example')),
        body: Stack(
          children: [
            // Main content of the application
            Center(child: Text('Main Content Here')),
            
            // Adding a corner banner to the top right corner
            CornerBanner(
              position: BannerPosition.topRight, // Position of the banner
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.red, // Background color of the banner
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0), // Padding around the text
                child: Text(
                  'Special Offer!', // Text displayed in the banner
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 16), // Text style
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The Scaffold widget provides the basic structure, including an AppBar and body.
// 4. The body contains a Stack widget, allowing us to overlay the corner banner on top of the main content.
// 5. The Center widget displays the main content of the app.
// 6. The CornerBanner widget is added to the Stack, positioned at the top right corner.
// 7. The banner contains a red container with a text message indicating a special offer.
// 8. The app can be run using the flutter run command, displaying the main content with the corner banner.
