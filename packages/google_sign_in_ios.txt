## Tutorial: Setting Up Google Sign-In in Your Flutter App

### Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `google_sign_in` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_sign_in: ^5.2.1  # Check for the latest version
```

### Step 2: Configure iOS Project

1. **Open your iOS project** in Xcode by navigating to the `ios` folder of your Flutter project.
2. **Enable Sign In with Google**:
   - Go to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab.
   - Add a new capability by clicking the "+" button and selecting **Sign In with Apple**.
3. **Add URL Schemes**:
   - In the **Info.plist** file, add the following under the `<dict>` tag:

   ```xml
   <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
   <array>
     <dict>
       <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
       <array>
         <string>com.googleusercontent.apps.YOUR_CLIENT_ID</string> <!-- Replace with your actual client ID -->
       </array>
     </dict>
   </array>
   ```

### Step 3: Implement Google Sign-In

Now, let's implement the Google Sign-In functionality in your Flutter app. Create a new Dart file, for example, `real_flutter.dart`, and add the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_sign_in/google_sign_in.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final GoogleSignIn _googleSignIn = GoogleSignIn();
  String _status = "Not signed in";

  // Method to handle Google Sign-In
  Future<void> _handleSignIn() async {
    try {
      await _googleSignIn.signIn();
      setState(() {
        _status = "Signed in as: ${_googleSignIn.currentUser?.displayName}";
      });
    } catch (error) {
      setState(() {
        _status = "Sign in failed: $error";
      });
    }
  }

  // Method to handle Sign-Out
  Future<void> _handleSignOut() async {
    await _googleSignIn.signOut();
    setState(() {
      _status = "Signed out";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Google Sign-In Example"),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_status),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _handleSignIn,
              child: Text("Sign in with Google"),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _handleSignOut,
              child: Text("Sign out"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Run Your App

Now, run your Flutter app on an iOS device or simulator. You should see buttons for signing in and signing out with Google.

## Complete Example: Google Sign-In in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_sign_in/google_sign_in.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final GoogleSignIn _googleSignIn = GoogleSignIn();
  String _status = "Not signed in";

  // Method to handle Google Sign-In
  Future<void> _handleSignIn() async {
    try {
      await _googleSignIn.signIn(); // Initiates the sign-in process
      setState(() {
        // Updates the status to show the signed-in user's name
        _status = "Signed in as: ${_googleSignIn.currentUser?.displayName}";
      });
    } catch (error) {
      setState(() {
        // Updates the status to show an error message if sign-in fails
        _status = "Sign in failed: $error";
      });
    }
  }

  // Method to handle Sign-Out
  Future<void> _handleSignOut() async {
    await _googleSignIn.signOut(); // Signs the user out
    setState(() {
      // Updates the status to show that the user is signed out
      _status = "Signed out";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Google Sign-In Example"), // Title of the app
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_status), // Displays the current sign-in status
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _handleSignIn, // Calls the sign-in method
              child: Text("Sign in with Google"),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _handleSignOut, // Calls the sign-out method
              child: Text("Sign out"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a title and the current sign-in status.
// 2. When the user clicks "Sign in with Google", the _handleSignIn method is called.
// 3. If the sign-in is successful, the user's display name is shown.
// 4. If the user clicks "Sign out", the _handleSignOut method is called, and the status updates accordingly.
// 5. The app provides feedback to the user based on their authentication state.
```
