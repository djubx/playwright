# Ninja Flutter Package

The **Ninja** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the development of Flutter applications by providing a set of utilities and features that enhance productivity and performance. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to streamline their workflow and implement common functionalities with minimal effort.

## When to Use Ninja

You might consider using the Ninja package in scenarios such as:
- **Rapid Prototyping**: When you need to quickly build a prototype with common features.
- **Feature-Rich Applications**: If your application requires multiple functionalities like animations, state management, or network requests.
- **Cross-Platform Development**: When you want to maintain a single codebase for both Android and iOS platforms.

## Key Features

- **Simplified State Management**: Ninja provides easy-to-use state management solutions that help in managing the app's state efficiently.
- **Built-in Animations**: The package includes a variety of pre-built animations that can be easily integrated into your application.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Ninja Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Ninja package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the Ninja package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ninja: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the Ninja package. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Ninja Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating the key features of the Ninja package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ninja/ninja.dart'; // Importing the Ninja package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ninja Package Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(), // Setting the home screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _data = ''; // Variable to hold fetched data

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchData(); // Fetching data when the screen initializes
  }

  // Function to fetch data using Ninja's network utilities
  void _fetchData() async {
    try {
      final response = await Ninja.get('https://api.example.com/data'); // Making a GET request
      setState(() {
        _data = response.data; // Updating the state with fetched data
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error fetching data: $e'); // Handling errors
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Ninja Package Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _data.isEmpty
            ? CircularProgressIndicator() // Show loading indicator while fetching data
            : Text(_data), // Display fetched data
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a home screen set to HomeScreen.
// 3. HomeScreen initializes its state and calls _fetchData() to retrieve data from an API.
// 4. The _fetchData() function uses Ninja's network utility to make a GET request.
// 5. Once the data is fetched, the state is updated, and the UI reflects the new data.
// 6. If the data is still being fetched, a loading indicator is displayed.
```
