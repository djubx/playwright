# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flutter Gallery Assets Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_gallery_assets` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_gallery_assets: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display an image from the `flutter_gallery_assets` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gallery_assets/flutter_gallery_assets.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Gallery Assets Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Gallery Assets Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Image.asset(
            GalleryAssets.images.exampleImage, // Replace with actual asset name
            fit: BoxFit.cover,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we import the necessary packages and create a simple Flutter application that displays an image from the gallery assets.

# Complete Example of Using the Flutter Gallery Assets Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gallery_assets/flutter_gallery_assets.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Gallery Assets Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Gallery Assets Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Displaying an image from the gallery assets
          child: Image.asset(
            GalleryAssets.images.exampleImage, // Replace with actual asset name
            fit: BoxFit.cover, // Ensures the image covers the available space
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The runApp function takes the RealFlutter widget and initializes the app.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with a title and a Center widget in the body.
// 5. The Center widget holds an Image widget that displays an asset from the gallery.
// 6. The Image.asset method is used to load the image, and BoxFit.cover ensures it fills the available space.
```
