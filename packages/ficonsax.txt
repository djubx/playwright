# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Ficonsax

## Step 1: Adding Ficonsax to Your Project

To get started with Ficonsax, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ficonsax: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing Ficonsax

In your Dart file, import the Ficonsax package:

```dart
import 'package:ficonsax/ficonsax.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Ficonsax Icons

You can now use Ficonsax icons in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s how to use an icon:

```dart
Icon(
  Ficonsax.home, // Replace 'home' with the desired icon name
  size: 30.0, // Set the size of the icon
  color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the icon
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing Icons

Ficonsax allows you to customize icons easily. You can change the size and color as shown in the example above. Additionally, you can use the `Ficonsax` class to access different styles of icons, such as solid, outline, and bulk.

```dart
Icon(
  Ficonsax.home, // Solid icon
  size: 30.0,
  color: Colors.red,
)
```

With these steps, you are now ready to use Ficonsax in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Ficonsax in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ficonsax/ficonsax.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ficonsax Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Ficonsax Icons'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a home icon from Ficonsax
            Icon(
              Ficonsax.home,
              size: 50.0,
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a settings icon from Ficonsax
            Icon(
              Ficonsax.setting,
              size: 50.0,
              color: Colors.green,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
            // Displaying a user icon from Ficonsax
            Icon(
              Ficonsax.user,
              size: 50.0,
              color: Colors.red,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomeScreen, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. HomeScreen builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 6. Each icon is created using the Icon widget, pulling icons from the Ficonsax package.
// 7. Icons are displayed with different colors and sizes, demonstrating the customization options available.
```

// Final Summary:
// The application starts with the main function, which initializes the Flutter app. The RealFlutter class sets up the MaterialApp, defining the theme and home screen. The HomeScreen class constructs the UI, featuring a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered column of icons sourced from the Ficonsax package. Each icon is displayed with specific sizes and colors, showcasing the package's flexibility and ease of use. This example serves as a practical demonstration of integrating and utilizing the Ficonsax package in a Flutter application.
