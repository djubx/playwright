# Complete Example of `fan_floating_menu`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fan_floating_menu/fan_floating_menu.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fan Floating Menu Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Fan Floating Menu Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Press the button to open the menu!'),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FanFloatingMenu(
          items: [
            FanMenuItem(
              icon: Icons.home,
              label: 'Home',
              onTap: () {
                // Handle Home action
                print('Home tapped');
              },
            ),
            FanMenuItem(
              icon: Icons.settings,
              label: 'Settings',
              onTap: () {
                // Handle Settings action
                print('Settings tapped');
              },
            ),
            FanMenuItem(
              icon: Icons.info,
              label: 'About',
              onTap: () {
                // Handle About action
                print('About tapped');
              },
            ),
          ],
          // Customize the menu appearance and behavior here
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title and a Center widget displaying a message.
// 4. The floatingActionButton property of the Scaffold is set to a FanFloatingMenu widget.
// 5. The FanFloatingMenu contains three menu items: Home, Settings, and About, each with an icon and an onTap action.
// 6. When a menu item is tapped, it prints a message to the console, demonstrating how to handle user interactions.
