# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Freestyle Speed Dial

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **freestyle_speed_dial** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  freestyle_speed_dial: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/freestyle_speed_dial).

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:freestyle_speed_dial/freestyle_speed_dial.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup

You can now use the `FreestyleSpeedDial` widget in your application. Below is a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
FreestyleSpeedDial(
  child: Icon(Icons.add),
  children: [
    SpeedDialChild(
      child: Icon(Icons.message),
      label: 'Message',
      onTap: () => print('Message tapped'),
    ),
    SpeedDialChild(
      child: Icon(Icons.call),
      label: 'Call',
      onTap: () => print('Call tapped'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if your actions require them (e.g., making calls or sending messages).

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file for actions like accessing contacts or making calls.

## Step 4: Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the speed dial by modifying properties such as `backgroundColor`, `foregroundColor`, and `animationSpeed`. Refer to the package documentation for a full list of customizable properties.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the **freestyle_speed_dial** package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Freestyle Speed Dial

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:freestyle_speed_dial/freestyle_speed_dial.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Freestyle Speed Dial Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Speed Dial Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Press the button below to see the speed dial!'),
      ),
      // Implementing the FreestyleSpeedDial widget
      floatingActionButton: FreestyleSpeedDial(
        child: Icon(Icons.add), // Main FAB icon
        children: [
          SpeedDialChild(
            child: Icon(Icons.message), // Icon for the first action
            label: 'Message', // Label for the first action
            onTap: () {
              // Action for the first button
              print('Message tapped');
            },
          ),
          SpeedDialChild(
            child: Icon(Icons.call), // Icon for the second action
            label: 'Call', // Label for the second action
            onTap: () {
              // Action for the second button
              print('Call tapped');
            },
          ),
          SpeedDialChild(
            child: Icon(Icons.email), // Icon for the third action
            label: 'Email', // Label for the third action
            onTap: () {
              // Action for the third button
              print('Email tapped');
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen contains an AppBar and a Center widget with a text message.
// 4. The FreestyleSpeedDial widget is used as a floating action button.
// 5. When the main FAB is pressed, it reveals three actions: Message, Call, and Email.
// 6. Each action has an icon and a label, and prints a message to the console when tapped.
