Here's a detailed technical blog on the "sealed_currencies" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Sealed Currencies Flutter Package

The **sealed_currencies** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to manage and validate currency types in Flutter applications. It provides a type-safe way to handle different currencies, ensuring that developers can work with currency values without the risk of errors associated with string manipulation or incorrect type usage.

## When to Use This Package

This package is particularly useful in applications that require financial transactions, such as e-commerce platforms, banking apps, or any application that deals with multiple currencies. By using sealed classes, it allows developers to define a limited set of currency types, making the code more robust and easier to maintain.

## Features

- **Type Safety**: Ensures that only valid currency types are used throughout the application.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to set up and use within existing Flutter projects.
- **Extensible**: Developers can easily add new currency types as needed.
- **Validation**: Built-in validation for currency values to prevent errors.

## Example Use Cases

1. **E-commerce Applications**: Manage multiple currencies for products and transactions.
2. **Financial Apps**: Handle various currency types for budgeting and expense tracking.
3. **International Applications**: Support users from different countries with their local currencies.

By leveraging the **sealed_currencies** package, developers can create more reliable and maintainable code when dealing with financial data.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Sealed Currencies

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **sealed_currencies** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **sealed_currencies** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sealed_currencies: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to define and use different currency types.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sealed_currencies/sealed_currencies.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sealed Currencies Example',
      home: CurrencyExample(),
    );
  }
}

class CurrencyExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create instances of different currencies
    final usd = Currency.usd(100.0);
    final eur = Currency.eur(85.0);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sealed Currencies Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('USD: ${usd.value}'),
            Text('EUR: ${eur.value}'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays the values of USD and EUR currencies. The `Currency` class is used to create instances of different currencies, ensuring type safety.

# Complete Example of Sealed Currencies

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sealed_currencies/sealed_currencies.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sealed Currencies Example',
      home: CurrencyExample(),
    );
  }
}

class CurrencyExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create instances of different currencies
    final usd = Currency.usd(100.0); // Create a USD currency instance with a value of 100.0
    final eur = Currency.eur(85.0); // Create a EUR currency instance with a value of 85.0

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sealed Currencies Example'), // Set the title of the app bar
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Center the column vertically
          children: [
            Text('USD: ${usd.value}'), // Display the value of USD
            Text('EUR: ${eur.value}'), // Display the value of EUR
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget CurrencyExample.
// 3. CurrencyExample creates instances of USD and EUR currencies using the sealed_currencies package.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child, which is a Column.
// 6. The Column displays the values of the USD and EUR currencies in Text widgets.
