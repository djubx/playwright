# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Alert Notification Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `alert_notification` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  alert_notification: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow notifications. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create an alert notification:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alert_notification/alert_notification.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Alert Notification Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              AlertNotification.show(
                context: context,
                title: 'Alert Title',
                message: 'This is an alert message.',
                actions: [
                  AlertAction(
                    label: 'OK',
                    onPressed: () {
                      // Handle OK action
                    },
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Alert'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, an alert notification will be displayed with a title, message, and an action button.

# Complete Example of Alert Notification in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alert_notification/alert_notification.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Alert Notification Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show alert notification when button is pressed
              AlertNotification.show(
                context: context,
                title: 'Alert Title', // Title of the alert
                message: 'This is an alert message.', // Message displayed in the alert
                actions: [
                  AlertAction(
                    label: 'OK', // Label for the action button
                    onPressed: () {
                      // Handle OK action
                      print('OK pressed'); // Log action to console
                    },
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Alert'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Alert Notification Example'.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child, which is an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the AlertNotification.show method is called.
// 6. This method displays an alert with a title and message, along with an action button labeled 'OK'.
// 7. Pressing the 'OK' button triggers the onPressed callback, which currently logs 'OK pressed' to the console.
