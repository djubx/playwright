# Square Progress Bar Flutter Package
=====================================

The `square_progress_bar` Flutter package is a customizable progress bar that can be used to display a square-shaped progress indicator in your Flutter applications. It is highly customizable, allowing you to change the size, color, and animation duration of the progress bar.

### When to Use This Package

This package is ideal for situations where you want to display a progress indicator that is not a traditional circular or linear progress bar. The square shape of the progress bar makes it a great choice for displaying progress in a grid or table.

### Features

*   Customizable size and color
*   Adjustable animation duration
*   Support for both determinate and indeterminate progress modes

# Tutorial: Using the Square Progress Bar Flutter Package
=====================================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To use the `square_progress_bar` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  square_progress_bar: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `square_progress_bar` package:

```dart
import 'package:square_progress_bar/square_progress_bar.dart';
```

### Step 3: Use the Square Progress Bar

To use the square progress bar, simply create a `SquareProgressBar` widget and customize its properties as needed. Here is an example:

```dart
SquareProgressBar(
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
  progress: 0.5,
  color: Colors.blue,
  animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
)
```

This will create a square progress bar that is 100x100 pixels in size, with a progress value of 0.5, and a blue color. The animation duration is set to 500 milliseconds.

### Platform-Specific Details

The `square_progress_bar` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to adjust the size and color of the progress bar to match the design guidelines of each platform.

### Configurations and Optimizations

To optimize the performance of the square progress bar, you can adjust the `animationDuration` property to reduce the animation time. Additionally, you can use the `determinate` property to switch between determinate and indeterminate progress modes.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:square_progress_bar/square_progress_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _progress = 0.0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Square Progress Bar Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              SquareProgressBar(
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                progress: _progress,
                color: Colors.blue,
                animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  setState(() {
                    _progress += 0.1;
                    if (_progress > 1.0) _progress = 0.0;
                  });
                },
                child: Text('Increment Progress'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and sees a square progress bar with a progress value of 0.0.
// 2. The user clicks the "Increment Progress" button to increment the progress value by 0.1.
// 3. The progress bar animates to the new progress value over a duration of 500 milliseconds.
// 4. The user can continue clicking the button to increment the progress value until it reaches 1.0.
// 5. When the progress value exceeds 1.0, it wraps around to 0.0 and the progress bar resets.
// This example demonstrates the basic usage of the SquareProgressBar widget and its customization options.

// The code flow is as follows:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created and returned as the root widget of the app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold and an AppBar.
// 3. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget with a Column of children.
// 4. The first child is a SquareProgressBar widget with a width, height, progress value, color, and animation duration.
// 5. The second child is a SizedBox widget with a height of 20 pixels.
// 6. The third child is an ElevatedButton widget with an onPressed callback.
// 7. When the button is pressed, the callback increments the _progress value and updates the state of the widget.
// 8. The SquareProgressBar widget is rebuilt with the new progress value and animates to the new value over the specified duration.
