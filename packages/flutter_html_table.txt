# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_html_table

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_html_table` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_html_table` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_html_table: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in a Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to create a table using the `flutter_html_table` package.

# Complete Example of flutter_html_table

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_html_table/flutter_html_table.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter HTML Table Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('HTML Table Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SingleChildScrollView(
            // Allows scrolling if the table is too large for the screen
            child: HtmlTable(
              data: [
                // Define the table data as a list of lists
                ['Header 1', 'Header 2', 'Header 3'],
                ['Row 1 Col 1', 'Row 1 Col 2', 'Row 1 Col 3'],
                ['Row 2 Col 1', 'Row 2 Col 2', 'Row 2 Col 3'],
                ['Row 3 Col 1', 'Row 3 Col 2', 'Row 3 Col 3'],
              ],
              // Optional: Customize the table style
              style: {
                'table': Style(
                  border: Border.all(color: Colors.black),
                  padding: EdgeInsets.all(8),
                ),
                'th': Style(
                  backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
                  fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                ),
                'td': Style(
                  border: Border.all(color: Colors.black),
                ),
              },
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "HTML Table Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a SingleChildScrollView is used to allow scrolling of the table if it exceeds the screen size.
// 6. The HtmlTable widget is used to create the table, with data defined as a list of lists.
// 7. The table style is customized to include borders and padding for better visual presentation.
// 8. The app displays a simple HTML table with headers and rows, demonstrating the capabilities of the flutter_html_table package.
