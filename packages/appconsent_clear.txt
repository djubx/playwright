void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {

      title: 'AppConsent Clear Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,

}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('AppConsent Clear Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Clear app consent
                await AppConsentClear.clearConsent();
                print('App consent cleared');
              },
              child: Text('Clear App Consent'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a button to clear app consent.
// 2. When the user clicks the button, the `AppConsentClear.clearConsent()` method is called.
// 3. The `clearConsent()` method clears the app consent by deleting any stored consent data.
// 4. After clearing the consent, a success message is printed to the console.
// 5. The app continues to run, and the user can use it as usual.

// Summary:
// This code demonstrates how to use the `appconsent_clear` package to clear app consent in a Flutter app.
// The app presents a button to clear app consent, and when clicked, it calls the `AppConsentClear.clearConsent()` method to clear the consent.
// The app continues to run after clearing the consent, and the user can use it as usual.
