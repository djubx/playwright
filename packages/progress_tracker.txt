Here's a detailed technical blog on the "progress_tracker" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Progress Tracker Flutter Package

The **progress_tracker** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers create visually appealing and functional progress tracking interfaces in their applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require users to complete a series of steps or tasks, such as onboarding processes, multi-step forms, or project management tools.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **progress_tracker** package in scenarios such as:
- **Onboarding Flows**: When you want to guide users through a series of steps to familiarize them with your app.
- **Multi-Step Forms**: For applications that require users to fill out information in stages, ensuring they can see their progress.
- **Task Management**: In project management applications where users need to track the completion of various tasks.

## Features

- **Customizable Steps**: Easily define and customize the steps in your progress tracker.
- **Visual Indicators**: Provides visual feedback on the completion status of each step.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

With these features, the **progress_tracker** package enhances user experience by providing clear visual cues about their progress, making it easier for them to navigate through tasks.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Progress Tracker Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **progress_tracker** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **progress_tracker** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  progress_tracker: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **progress_tracker** in your app.

# Complete Example of Progress Tracker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:progress_tracker/progress_tracker.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Progress Tracker Example',
      home: ProgressTrackerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class ProgressTrackerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ProgressTrackerDemoState createState() => _ProgressTrackerDemoState();
}

class _ProgressTrackerDemoState extends State<ProgressTrackerDemo> {
  // Define the current step
  int _currentStep = 0;

  // List of steps for the progress tracker
  final List<String> _steps = [
    'Step 1: Introduction',
    'Step 2: Details',
    'Step 3: Confirmation',
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Progress Tracker Demo'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Progress Tracker Widget
          ProgressTracker(
            steps: _steps,
            currentStep: _currentStep,
            onStepTapped: (index) {
              // Update the current step when tapped
              setState(() {
                _currentStep = index;
              });
            },
          ),
          Expanded(
            child: Center(
              child: Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: [
                  // Display current step content
                  Text(
                    _steps[_currentStep],
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                  ),
                  SizedBox(height: 20),
                  // Button to go to the next step
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      // Move to the next step if possible
                      if (_currentStep < _steps.length - 1) {
                        setState(() {
                          _currentStep++;
                        });
                      }
                    },
                    child: Text('Next'),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The ProgressTrackerDemo widget is the main screen, which maintains the current step state.
// 3. The ProgressTracker widget displays the steps and highlights the current step.
// 4. When a step is tapped, the current step is updated.
// 5. The content of the current step is displayed, along with a button to proceed to the next step.
// 6. Pressing the "Next" button increments the current step until the last step is reached.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the **progress_tracker** package. The application consists of three steps, and users can navigate through them using a "Next" button. 

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application starts with the `MyApp` class, which initializes the `MaterialApp`.
- The `ProgressTrackerDemo` widget manages the current step state and displays the progress tracker.
- The `ProgressTracker` widget visually represents the steps and highlights the current step.
- Users can tap on steps to navigate directly or use the "Next" button to proceed sequentially.
- The application flow is straightforward, providing a clear and interactive way for users to track their progress through the defined steps.
