# Tutorial: Using the Nine Grid View Package
=============================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To use the `nine_grid_view` package, you need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  nine_grid_view: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `nine_grid_view` package:

```dart
import 'package:nine_grid_view/nine_grid_view.dart';
```

### Step 3: Create a Nine Grid View

To create a nine grid view, you need to use the `NineGridView` widget. Here is a basic example:

```dart
NineGridView(
  items: [
    'Item 1',
    'Item 2',
    'Item 3',
    'Item 4',
    'Item 5',
    'Item 6',
    'Item 7',
    'Item 8',
    'Item 9',
  ],
  itemBuilder: (context, item) {
    return Container(
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        border: Border.all(color: Colors.grey),
      ),
      child: Center(
        child: Text(item),
      ),
    );
  },
)
```

This will create a 3x3 grid view with nine items.

### Platform-Specific Details

The `nine_grid_view` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to adjust the layout and styling to fit your specific use case.

### Configurations and Optimizations

You can customize the grid item layout by using the `itemBuilder` property. You can also adjust the grid size by using the `gridSize` property.

To optimize performance, you can use the ` NineGridView.builder` constructor, which allows you to build the grid view lazily.

            // Create a container with a border and center the text
            return Container(
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                border: Border.all(color: Colors.grey),
              ),
              child: Center(
                child: Text(item),
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by running the main function, which creates a new MyApp widget.
// The MyApp widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The home property of the MaterialApp is set to MyHomePage, which is a stateless widget.
// The MyHomePage widget builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// The body of the Scaffold is a Center widget, which centers its child.
// The child of the Center widget is a NineGridView, which creates a 3x3 grid view with nine items.
// Each item in the grid view is a container with a border and centered text.
