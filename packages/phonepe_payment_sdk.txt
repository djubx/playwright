# Tutorial: Setting Up PhonePe Payment SDK in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `phonepe_payment_sdk` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `phonepe_payment_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  phonepe_payment_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="phonepe_sdk_key"
            android:value="YOUR_PHONEPE_SDK_KEY" />
    </application>

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
</manifest>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pod install
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. **Import the Package**:

```dart
import 'package:phonepe_payment_sdk/phonepe_payment_sdk.dart';
```

2. **Initialize the SDK**:

You need to initialize the SDK before making any payment requests. This is typically done in the `initState` method of your main widget.

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  PhonePePaymentSdk.initialize();
}
```

3. **Create a Payment Request**:

You can create a payment request using the following method:

```dart
void initiatePayment() async {
  final paymentResponse = await PhonePePaymentSdk.startPayment(
    amount: 100.0, // Amount in INR
    orderId: 'order123', // Unique order ID
    merchantId: 'merchant123', // Your merchant ID
    callbackUrl: 'https://yourcallbackurl.com', // Callback URL
  );

  // Handle the payment response
  if (paymentResponse.status == PaymentStatus.success) {
    // Payment was successful
  } else {
    // Payment failed or was cancelled
  }
}
```

4. **Handle Payment Response**:

You can handle the payment response to determine the success or failure of the transaction.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered the setup and usage of the `phonepe_payment_sdk` package in a Flutter application. By following these steps, you can easily integrate PhonePe payments into your app, providing users with a secure and reliable payment option.

# Complete Example: PhonePe Payment Integration

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:phonepe_payment_sdk/phonepe_payment_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PhonePe Payment Demo',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the PhonePe Payment SDK
    PhonePePaymentSdk.initialize();
  }

  void initiatePayment() async {
    // Start the payment process
    final paymentResponse = await PhonePePaymentSdk.startPayment(
      amount: 100.0, // Amount in INR
      orderId: 'order123', // Unique order ID
      merchantId: 'merchant123', // Your merchant ID
      callbackUrl: 'https://yourcallbackurl.com', // Callback URL
    );

    // Handle the payment response
    if (paymentResponse.status == PaymentStatus.success) {
      // Payment was successful
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Successful!')),
      );
    } else {
      // Payment failed or was cancelled
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Failed!')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PhonePe Payment Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: initiatePayment, // Trigger payment on button press
          child: Text('Pay with PhonePe'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the PhonePe Payment SDK in the initState method of the PaymentScreen widget.
// 2. When the user presses the "Pay with PhonePe" button, the initiatePayment method is called.
// 3. This method creates a payment request with the specified amount, order ID, merchant ID, and callback URL.
// 4. The payment response is awaited, and based on the response status, a success or failure message is displayed to the user using a SnackBar.
```
