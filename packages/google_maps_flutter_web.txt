<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Google Maps Flutter Web Package

The `google_maps_flutter_web` package is a Flutter plugin that allows developers to integrate Google Maps into their Flutter web applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require location-based services, such as ride-sharing apps, travel guides, or any application that benefits from displaying geographical data.

You should consider using the `google_maps_flutter_web` package when:
- You need to display maps in your Flutter web application.
- You want to provide location-based services, such as geolocation, markers, and routes.
- You are building an application that requires user interaction with maps, such as selecting locations or viewing nearby points of interest.

## Features
- **Interactive Maps**: Users can pan, zoom, and interact with the map.
- **Markers**: Easily add markers to indicate specific locations on the map.
- **Polylines and Polygons**: Draw routes and areas on the map.
- **Geolocation**: Access the user's current location and display it on the map.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Google Maps in Flutter Web

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `google_maps_flutter_web` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter web application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `google_maps_flutter_web` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  google_maps_flutter_web: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter_web).

## Step 2: Configure Web Support
Ensure that your Flutter project is set up for web development. You can check this by running:

```bash
flutter config --enable-web
```

If you haven't created a web project yet, you can create one using:

```bash
flutter create .
```

## Step 3: Obtain Google Maps API Key
To use Google Maps, you need an API key. Follow these steps:
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Navigate to the "APIs & Services" section and enable the "Maps JavaScript API".
4. Create credentials to obtain your API key.

## Step 4: Add API Key to Your Project
You need to include your API key in the `index.html` file located in the `web` directory of your Flutter project. Open `index.html` and add the following script tag inside the `<head>` section:

```html
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY"></script>
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Google Maps API key.

## Step 5: Create the Map Widget
Now, you can create a simple map widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. Create a new Dart file, e.g., `map_widget.dart`.
2. Import the necessary packages and create a `RealFlutter` class that extends `StatelessWidget`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_maps_flutter/google_maps_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Google Maps Flutter Web'),
      ),
      body: GoogleMap(
        initialCameraPosition: CameraPosition(
          target: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194), // San Francisco coordinates
          zoom: 10,
        ),
        markers: {
          Marker(
            markerId: MarkerId('sfMarker'),
            position: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194),
            infoWindow: InfoWindow(title: 'San Francisco'),
          ),
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 6: Run Your Application
Finally, run your application using:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

You should see a Google Map displayed in your web application with a marker for San Francisco.

# Complete Example of Google Maps Flutter Web

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_maps_flutter/google_maps_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Google Maps Flutter Web',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Declare a GoogleMapController
  GoogleMapController? mapController;

  // Initial camera position
  static const LatLng _center = LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194); // San Francisco

  // Method to handle map creation
  void _onMapCreated(GoogleMapController controller) {
    mapController = controller;
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Google Maps Flutter Web'),
      ),
      body: GoogleMap(
        onMapCreated: _onMapCreated, // Set the map controller
        initialCameraPosition: CameraPosition(
          target: _center, // Set the initial position
          zoom: 10, // Set the initial zoom level
        ),
        markers: {
          Marker(
            markerId: MarkerId('sfMarker'), // Unique ID for the marker
            position: _center, // Position of the marker
            infoWindow: InfoWindow(title: 'San Francisco'), // Info window for the marker
          ),
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with the title 'Google Maps Flutter Web'.
// 3. The home of the MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In RealFlutter, we declare a GoogleMapController to manage the map.
// 5. The _onMapCreated method is called when the map is created, allowing us to store the controller.
// 6. The GoogleMap widget is built with an initial camera position set to San Francisco.
// 7. A marker is added to the map at the same location, displaying an info window when tapped.
```

// The application starts by running the `MyApp` widget, which sets up the main structure of the app. The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that manages the Google Map. When the map is created, the `_onMapCreated` method is called, allowing us to control the map through the `mapController`. The map is initialized to show San Francisco, and a marker is placed at that location, providing an interactive experience for users.
