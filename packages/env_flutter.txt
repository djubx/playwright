# Overview of the env_flutter Package

The `env_flutter` package is a powerful tool for managing environment variables in Flutter applications. It allows developers to define and access environment-specific configurations easily, making it ideal for managing different settings for development, staging, and production environments. 

## When to Use `env_flutter`
- **Environment Management**: When you need to switch configurations based on the environment (e.g., API endpoints, feature flags).
- **Sensitive Information**: To manage sensitive data like API keys without hardcoding them into your source code.
- **Configuration Files**: When you want to load configurations from `.env` files or similar sources.

## Key Features
- **Easy Configuration**: Load environment variables from `.env` files.
- **Type Safety**: Access variables with type safety, reducing runtime errors.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Customizable**: Allows for custom parsing and loading of environment variables.

# Setting Up and Using env_flutter

## Installation
To get started with `env_flutter`, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  env_flutter: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configuration to support environment variables:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       buildTypes {
           release {
               ...
               buildConfigField "String", "API_URL", "\"https://api.production.com\""
           }
           debug {
               ...
               buildConfigField "String", "API_URL", "\"https://api.development.com\""
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. For iOS, you can define environment variables in the `Info.plist` file:
   ```xml
   <key>API_URL</key>
   <string>https://api.production.com</string>
   ```

## Using the Package
To use `env_flutter`, you need to create a `.env` file in the root of your Flutter project. Hereâ€™s an example of what it might look like:

```
API_URL=https://api.example.com
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

You can then access these variables in your Flutter application as follows:

```dart
import 'package:env_flutter/env_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  await EnvFlutter.load(); // Load the environment variables
  final apiUrl = EnvFlutter.get('API_URL'); // Access the API_URL variable
  print(apiUrl); // Output the API URL
}
```

```

# Complete Example of Using env_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:env_flutter/env_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  // Load environment variables from the .env file
  await EnvFlutter.load();

  // Start the Flutter application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Access the API_URL variable from the environment
    final apiUrl = EnvFlutter.get('API_URL');
    
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Env Flutter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Environment Variables Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('API URL: $apiUrl'), // Display the API URL
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. It first loads the environment variables using EnvFlutter.load().
// 3. After loading, it runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 4. In the RealFlutter widget, it retrieves the API_URL variable using EnvFlutter.get().
// 5. Finally, it displays the API URL in the center of the screen using a Text widget.
```

```

### Final Summary
In this example, we demonstrated how to set up and use the `env_flutter` package in a Flutter application. The application loads environment variables from a `.env` file, retrieves the API URL, and displays it on the screen. This approach allows for easy management of different configurations across various environments, enhancing the flexibility and security of your Flutter applications.
