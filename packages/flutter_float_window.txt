# Flutter Float Window Package: A Comprehensive Guide

## <-- START_DESCRIPTION -->

### Description

The `flutter_float_window` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create floating windows or overlays in their applications. This package allows you to display a widget that can float above other applications, providing a unique user experience. It is particularly useful for applications that require persistent notifications, chat heads, or any feature that benefits from being accessible while the user interacts with other apps.

### When to Use

You might consider using `flutter_float_window` in scenarios such as:
- **Chat Applications**: To create chat heads that allow users to quickly access conversations.
- **Media Players**: For displaying playback controls that remain visible while users navigate other apps.
- **Task Management**: To show floating reminders or task lists that users can interact with at any time.

### Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, although with some platform-specific configurations.
- **Customizable Floating Window**: You can customize the appearance and behavior of the floating window.
- **Drag and Drop**: Users can drag the floating window around the screen for better accessibility.
- **Persistent Visibility**: The floating window can remain visible even when the app is in the background.

### Tutorial

#### Installation

To get started with the `flutter_float_window` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_float_window: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

#### Platform-Specific Configuration

**For Android:**
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
```

3. Ensure that your app's target SDK version is set to 21 or higher.

**For iOS:**
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request permission for displaying overlays:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for chat features.</string>
```

#### Basic Usage

To use the `flutter_float_window` package, you need to initialize the floating window and set its properties. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_float_window/flutter_float_window.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Float Window Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Initialize the floating window
            FlutterFloatWindow.showFloatWindow(
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              x: 100,
              y: 100,
              widget: Container(
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Center(child: Text('Floating Window')),
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Floating Window'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_float_window/flutter_float_window.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Float Window Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Initialize the floating window
            FlutterFloatWindow.showFloatWindow(
              width: 100, // Set the width of the floating window
              height: 100, // Set the height of the floating window
              x: 100, // Initial x position
              y: 100, // Initial y position
              widget: Container(
                color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the floating window
                child: Center(child: Text('Floating Window')), // Content of the floating window
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Floating Window'), // Button to trigger the floating window
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a HomeScreen as its home.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a button that, when pressed, initializes and shows a floating window.
// 4. The floating window is displayed at a specified position (x: 100, y: 100) with a size of 100x100 pixels.
// 5. The floating window contains a blue container with centered text, providing a simple visual representation.
