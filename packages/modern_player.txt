# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Modern Player

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **modern_player** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **modern_player** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  modern_player: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio playback.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library for media selection.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple media player using the **modern_player** package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:modern_player/modern_player.dart';
```

2. Create a basic UI with playback controls:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late ModernPlayer _player;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _player = ModernPlayer();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _player.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  void _play() {
    _player.play('https://www.example.com/audio.mp3'); // Replace with your audio URL
  }

  void _pause() {
    _player.pause();
  }

  void _stop() {
    _player.stop();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Modern Player Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: _play, child: Text('Play')),
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: _pause, child: Text('Pause')),
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: _stop, child: Text('Stop')),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic media player with play, pause, and stop functionalities.

# Complete Example of Modern Player

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:modern_player/modern_player.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late ModernPlayer _player; // Declare the ModernPlayer instance

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _player = ModernPlayer(); // Initialize the player
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _player.dispose(); // Dispose of the player when not needed
    super.dispose();
  }

  void _play() {
    _player.play('https://www.example.com/audio.mp3'); // Play audio from URL
  }

  void _pause() {
    _player.pause(); // Pause the audio playback
  }

  void _stop() {
    _player.stop(); // Stop the audio playback
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Modern Player Example')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: _play, child: Text('Play')), // Play button
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: _pause, child: Text('Pause')), // Pause button
            ElevatedButton(onPressed: _stop, child: Text('Stop')), // Stop button
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. In the initState method, an instance of ModernPlayer is initialized.
// 3. The dispose method ensures that resources are released when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
// 4. The build method creates a simple UI with three buttons: Play, Pause, and Stop.
// 5. Each button is linked to its respective function, which controls the playback of the audio file.
// 6. The audio file is played from a specified URL when the Play button is pressed, paused when the Pause button is pressed, and stopped when the Stop button is pressed.
```
