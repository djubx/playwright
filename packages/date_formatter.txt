# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using date_formatter

## Installation
To add the `date_formatter` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  date_formatter: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `date_formatter` package works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms. You may need to configure your app's permissions or settings based on your specific use case, but generally, no additional configurations are required for using this package.

## Basic Usage
To use the `date_formatter` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:date_formatter/date_formatter.dart';
```

You can then format dates using the provided methods. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
DateTime now = DateTime.now();
String formattedDate = DateFormatter.format(now, format: 'yyyy-MM-dd');
```

This will convert the current date into a string formatted as "2023-10-01".

## Example of Formatting with Locale
To format a date with a specific locale, you can do the following:

```dart
String formattedDate = DateFormatter.format(now, format: 'MMMM d, yyyy', locale: 'en_US');
```

This will output something like "October 1, 2023".

With these steps, you are now ready to integrate the `date_formatter` package into your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using date_formatter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:date_formatter/date_formatter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Date Formatter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Date Formatter Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DateDisplay(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DateDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current date and time
    DateTime now = DateTime.now();
    
    // Format the date in different styles
    String formattedDate1 = DateFormatter.format(now, format: 'yyyy-MM-dd');
    String formattedDate2 = DateFormatter.format(now, format: 'MMMM d, yyyy');
    String formattedDate3 = DateFormatter.format(now, format: 'EEEE, MMMM d, yyyy', locale: 'en_US');

    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Formatted Date (yyyy-MM-dd): $formattedDate1'),
        Text('Formatted Date (MMMM d, yyyy): $formattedDate2'),
        Text('Formatted Date (EEEE, MMMM d, yyyy): $formattedDate3'),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

// The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title "Date Formatter Demo".
// The body of the Scaffold contains a centered DateDisplay widget.
// The DateDisplay widget retrieves the current date and formats it in three different styles.
// Each formatted date is displayed in a Text widget within a Column.
// The first format shows the date as "yyyy-MM-dd", the second as "MMMM d, yyyy",
// and the third as "EEEE, MMMM d, yyyy" with the locale set to 'en_US'.

// This example demonstrates how to use the date_formatter package to format and display dates
// in various formats, making it easy to present date information in a user-friendly manner.
