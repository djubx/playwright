```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the package in your Dart file:

Platform-specific details:

* Android: The `tbib_splash_screen` package uses the `android/app/src/main/res/drawable` directory to store the splash screen image. Make sure to add the image to this directory and update the `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file to reference the image.
* iOS: The `tbib_splash_screen` package uses the `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets` directory to store the splash screen image. Make sure to add the image to this directory and update the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file to reference the image.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tbib_splash_screen/tbib_splash_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tbib Splash Screen Demo',
      home: TbibSplashScreen(
        // Set the background color of the splash screen
        backgroundColor: Colors.white,
        
        // Set the logo of the splash screen
        logo: Image.asset('assets/logo.png'),
        
        // Set the title of the splash screen
        title: Text('My App'),
        
        // Set the animation duration of the splash screen
        animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 2000),
        
        // Set the transition effect of the splash screen
        transitionEffect: TbibTransitionEffect.fade,
        
        // Set the next screen to navigate to after the splash screen
        nextScreen: MyHomePage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('My Home Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to my home page'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app, and the splash screen appears.
// 2. The splash screen displays the logo, title, and background color.
// 3. After the animation duration, the splash screen transitions to the next screen.
// 4. The next screen is the MyHomePage widget, which displays a scaffold with an app bar and a body.
// 5. The user can navigate back to the splash screen by pressing the back button.
```

// The code flow is as follows:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. The MyApp widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home property.
// 3. The home property is set to the TbibSplashScreen widget.
// 4. The TbibSplashScreen widget displays the splash screen with the specified properties.
// 5. After the animation duration, the TbibSplashScreen widget transitions to the next screen.
// 6. The next screen is the MyHomePage widget, which displays a scaffold with an app bar and a body.
