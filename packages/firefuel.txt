# Firefuel Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Tutorial

### Step 1: Adding Firefuel to Your Project
To get started with Firefuel, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firefuel: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

### Step 2: Configuring Firebase
Before using Firefuel, you need to set up Firebase for your Flutter project.

#### For Android:
1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Add an Android app to your project and follow the instructions to download the `google-services.json` file.
4. Place the `google-services.json` file in the `android/app` directory.
5. Update your `android/build.gradle` file to include the Google services classpath:
   ```groovy
   buildscript {
       dependencies {
           // Add this line
           classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10'
       }
   }
   ```
6. In your `android/app/build.gradle`, apply the Google services plugin:
   ```groovy
   apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
   ```

#### For iOS:
1. In the Firebase Console, add an iOS app and download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.
2. Place the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the `ios/Runner` directory.
3. Open your `ios/Podfile` and ensure you have the following:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   use_frameworks!
   ```

### Step 3: Initializing Firefuel
In your main Dart file, initialize Firefuel in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:firefuel/firefuel.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firefuel.initialize(); // Initialize Firefuel
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### Step 4: Using Firefuel
You can now use Firefuel's features in your application. For example, to implement user authentication, you can use the following code:

```dart
final user = await Firefuel.auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123');
```

This will sign in a user with the provided email and password.

# Firefuel Flutter Package: Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:firefuel/firefuel.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firefuel.initialize(); // Initialize Firefuel
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Firefuel Example',
      home: HomeScreen(), // Set the home screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _message = 'Welcome!'; // Default message
  final TextEditingController _emailController = TextEditingController();
  final TextEditingController _passwordController = TextEditingController();

  // Function to handle user sign-in
  void _signIn() async {
    try {
      // Attempt to sign in the user
      final user = await Firefuel.auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(
        email: _emailController.text,
        password: _passwordController.text,
      );
      setState(() {
        _message = 'Welcome, ${user.email}!'; // Update message on successful sign-in
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _message = 'Error: ${e.toString()}'; // Update message on error
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Firefuel Example')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(_message), // Display the message
            TextField(
              controller: _emailController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
            ),
            TextField(
              controller: _passwordController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Password'),
              obscureText: true,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _signIn, // Call sign-in function on button press
              child: Text('Sign In'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing Firefuel.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 4. The user can enter their email and password in the text fields.
// 5. When the "Sign In" button is pressed, the _signIn function is called.
// 6. The _signIn function attempts to authenticate the user using Firefuel.
// 7. If successful, a welcome message is displayed; otherwise, an error message is shown.
