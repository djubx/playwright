                orderId: 'order_12345', // Unique order ID
              );

              // Process the payment
              try {
                final response = await binancePay.processPayment(paymentRequest);
                // Handle successful payment
                print('Payment successful: ${response.transactionId}');
              } catch (e) {
                // Handle payment error
                print('Payment failed: $e');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pay with Binance'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with a MaterialApp widget that contains a Scaffold.
// 2. An AppBar is created with the title 'Binance Pay Example'.
// 3. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. An ElevatedButton is displayed with the text 'Pay with Binance'.
// 5. When the button is pressed, a BinancePay instance is created.
// 6. A PaymentRequest is constructed with the amount, currency, and order ID.
// 7. The payment is processed using the `processPayment` method.
// 8. If the payment is successful, the transaction ID is printed to the console.
// 9. If the payment fails, an error message is printed to the console.
