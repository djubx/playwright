# Tutorial: Setting Up UPI Pay in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the UPI Pay package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the UPI Pay package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  upi_pay: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/upi_pay).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries to allow your app to make network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the UPI Pay Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:upi_pay/upi_pay.dart';
```

2. Create a function to initiate a UPI payment:

```dart
void initiatePayment() async {
  // Create a UPI payment request
  UpiPay upiPay = UpiPay(
    app: 'com.google.android.apps.nbu.paisa.user', // UPI app package name
    payeeName: 'Merchant Name',
    payeeVpa: 'merchant@upi', // UPI ID of the merchant
    amount: '10.00', // Amount to be paid
    transactionId: 'txn123456', // Unique transaction ID
    transactionRefId: 'ref123456', // Reference ID for the transaction
    transactionNote: 'Payment for order #1234', // Note for the transaction
  );

  // Start the payment process
  var response = await upiPay.startPayment();

  // Handle the response
  if (response != null) {
    print('Payment Response: $response');
  } else {
    print('Payment failed or was cancelled.');
  }
}
```

3. Call the `initiatePayment` function when a button is pressed or at the appropriate time in your app.

With these steps, you can successfully integrate UPI payments into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example: UPI Payment in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:upi_pay/upi_pay.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'UPI Pay Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to initiate UPI payment
  void initiatePayment() async {
    // Create a UPI payment request
    UpiPay upiPay = UpiPay(
      app: 'com.google.android.apps.nbu.paisa.user', // UPI app package name
      payeeName: 'Merchant Name',
      payeeVpa: 'merchant@upi', // UPI ID of the merchant
      amount: '10.00', // Amount to be paid
      transactionId: 'txn123456', // Unique transaction ID
      transactionRefId: 'ref123456', // Reference ID for the transaction
      transactionNote: 'Payment for order #1234', // Note for the transaction
    );

    // Start the payment process
    var response = await upiPay.startPayment();

    // Handle the response
    if (response != null) {
      print('Payment Response: $response');
    } else {
      print('Payment failed or was cancelled.');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('UPI Payment Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: initiatePayment, // Call the payment function on button press
          child: Text('Pay with UPI'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled "Pay with UPI".
// 2. When the button is pressed, the `initiatePayment` function is called.
// 3. Inside `initiatePayment`, a UPI payment request is created with the necessary details.
// 4. The payment process is initiated using `startPayment()` method.
// 5. The response from the payment process is handled, and the result is printed to the console.
// 6. If the payment is successful, the response will contain the payment details; otherwise, it indicates failure or cancellation.
```
