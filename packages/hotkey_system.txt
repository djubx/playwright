# Hotkey System Flutter Package

The `hotkey_system` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement keyboard shortcuts in their applications. This package allows you to define hotkeys that can trigger specific actions, enhancing user experience by providing quick access to functionalities without relying solely on mouse interactions.

## When to Use This Package
- **Desktop Applications**: Ideal for applications that run on desktop platforms where keyboard shortcuts are common.
- **Games**: Useful in game development for quick actions like pausing, resuming, or executing commands.
- **Productivity Tools**: Great for applications that require frequent user interactions, such as text editors or data management tools.

## Features
- **Custom Hotkey Definitions**: Easily define your own hotkeys for various actions.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly across multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Event Handling**: Provides a straightforward way to handle key press events and execute corresponding actions.
- **Focus Management**: Automatically manages focus to ensure that hotkeys work as expected based on the current context.

Overall, the `hotkey_system` package is an essential addition for any Flutter application that aims to improve user interaction through keyboard shortcuts.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Hotkey System Package

## Installation
To get started with the `hotkey_system` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hotkey_system: ^0.2.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, no additional configuration is required. The package works out of the box.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to listen for keyboard events. You may need to adjust your app's Info.plist file if you encounter any issues.

## Using the Package
To use the `hotkey_system` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:hotkey_system/hotkey_system.dart';
```

### Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up hotkeys in your Flutter application:

1. Create an instance of `HotKeyManager`.
2. Define your hotkeys and their corresponding actions.
3. Register the hotkeys with the manager.

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HotkeyExample(),
    );
  }
}

class HotkeyExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HotkeyExampleState createState() => _HotkeyExampleState();
}

class _HotkeyExampleState extends State<HotkeyExample> {
  final HotKeyManager _hotKeyManager = HotKeyManager();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _registerHotkeys();
  }

  void _registerHotkeys() {
    // Define a hotkey for Ctrl + H
    final hotKey = HotKey(KeyCode.keyH, modifiers: [KeyModifier.control]);
    
    // Register the hotkey with an action
    _hotKeyManager.register(hotKey, (key) {
      print('Hotkey Ctrl + H pressed!');
      // Add your action here
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _hotKeyManager.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Hotkey System Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Press Ctrl + H')),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to set up a simple hotkey that listens for the combination of Ctrl + H and prints a message to the console when pressed.

# Complete Example of Hotkey System in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hotkey_system/hotkey_system.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HotkeyExample(),
    );
  }
}

class HotkeyExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HotkeyExampleState createState() => _HotkeyExampleState();
}

class _HotkeyExampleState extends State<HotkeyExample> {
  final HotKeyManager _hotKeyManager = HotKeyManager();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _registerHotkeys(); // Call the method to register hotkeys
  }

  void _registerHotkeys() {
    // Define a hotkey for Ctrl + H
    final hotKey = HotKey(KeyCode.keyH, modifiers: [KeyModifier.control]);
    
    // Register the hotkey with an action
    _hotKeyManager.register(hotKey, (key) {
      print('Hotkey Ctrl + H pressed!'); // Action to perform
      // You can add more functionality here
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _hotKeyManager.dispose(); // Clean up the hotkey manager
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Hotkey System Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Press Ctrl + H')),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp with HotkeyExample as the home.
// 3. In HotkeyExample, we initialize the HotKeyManager in initState.
// 4. The _registerHotkeys method defines a hotkey (Ctrl + H) and registers it.
// 5. When Ctrl + H is pressed, the registered action is executed, printing a message to the console.
// 6. The dispose method cleans up the HotKeyManager when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
