# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Reactive Flutter Rating Bar

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `reactive_flutter_rating_bar` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  reactive_flutter_rating_bar: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Rating Bar

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `ReactiveRatingBar` in your widget tree.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reactive_flutter_rating_bar/reactive_flutter_rating_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Reactive Rating Bar Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RatingBar(
            initialRating: 3,
            minRating: 1,
            direction: Axis.horizontal,
            allowHalfRating: true,
            itemCount: 5,
            itemSize: 40.0,
            ratingWidget: RatingWidget(
              full: Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.amber),
              half: Icon(Icons.star_half, color: Colors.amber),
              empty: Icon(Icons.star_border, color: Colors.amber),
            ),
            onRatingUpdate: (rating) {
              print(rating); // Handle the rating update
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a rating bar in the center of the screen. The `RatingBar` widget allows users to select a rating from 1 to 5, including half ratings. The `onRatingUpdate` callback is triggered whenever the user selects a rating, allowing you to handle the rating value as needed.

# Complete Example of Reactive Flutter Rating Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reactive_flutter_rating_bar/reactive_flutter_rating_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Reactive Rating Bar Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RatingBar(
            initialRating: 3, // Set the initial rating to 3
            minRating: 1, // Minimum rating allowed
            direction: Axis.horizontal, // Rating bar direction
            allowHalfRating: true, // Allow half ratings
            itemCount: 5, // Total number of items (stars)
            itemSize: 40.0, // Size of each item
            ratingWidget: RatingWidget(
              full: Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.amber), // Full star icon
              half: Icon(Icons.star_half, color: Colors.amber), // Half star icon
              empty: Icon(Icons.star_border, color: Colors.amber), // Empty star icon
            ),
            onRatingUpdate: (rating) {
              print(rating); // Print the updated rating to the console
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a RatingBar is created with specific properties:
//    - initialRating: Sets the starting rating to 3.
//    - minRating: Defines the minimum rating as 1.
//    - direction: Specifies the rating bar to be horizontal.
//    - allowHalfRating: Enables half-star ratings.
//    - itemCount: Sets the total number of stars to 5.
//    - itemSize: Defines the size of each star.
//    - ratingWidget: Customizes the appearance of the stars (full, half, empty).
// 4. The onRatingUpdate callback is triggered whenever the user selects a rating, printing the rating value to the console.
