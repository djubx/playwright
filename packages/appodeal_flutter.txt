# Tutorial: Setting Up the Appodeal Flutter Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `appodeal_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `appodeal_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  appodeal_flutter: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Setup

### Android Setup

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <!-- Add Appodeal metadata -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="appodeal_app_key"
            android:value="YOUR_APP_KEY" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `android/app/build.gradle` file includes the required dependencies:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:20.5.0' // Check for the latest version
    implementation 'com.appodeal.ads:sdk:2.10.0' // Check for the latest version
}
```

### iOS Setup

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the Appodeal key in your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>AppodealAppKey</key>
<string>YOUR_APP_KEY</string>
```

2. **CocoaPods Installation**: Ensure you have the necessary pods in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Appodeal', '~> 2.10.0' # Check for the latest version
```

Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to install the dependencies.

## Step 3: Initialize Appodeal

In your main Dart file, initialize Appodeal in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appodeal_flutter/appodeal_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  Appodeal.initialize('YOUR_APP_KEY', [
    AdType.banner,
    AdType.interstitial,
    AdType.rewardedVideo,
  ]);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Implementing Ads

You can now implement ads in your application. For example, to show a banner ad:

```dart
Appodeal.show(AdType.banner);
```

For interstitial ads:

```dart
if (await Appodeal.isLoaded(AdType.interstitial)) {
  Appodeal.show(AdType.interstitial);
}
```

For rewarded video ads:

```dart
if (await Appodeal.isLoaded(AdType.rewardedVideo)) {
  Appodeal.show(AdType.rewardedVideo);
}
```

## Conclusion

You have now set up the `appodeal_flutter` package in your Flutter application. You can implement various ad formats and start monetizing your app effectively.

# Complete Example of Appodeal Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appodeal_flutter/appodeal_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize Appodeal with your app key and ad types
  Appodeal.initialize('YOUR_APP_KEY', [
    AdType.banner,
    AdType.interstitial,
    AdType.rewardedVideo,
  ]);
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Appodeal Flutter Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Show a banner ad when the screen is initialized
    Appodeal.show(AdType.banner);
  }

  // Function to show interstitial ad
  void _showInterstitialAd() async {
    if (await Appodeal.isLoaded(AdType.interstitial)) {
      Appodeal.show(AdType.interstitial);
    } else {
      print('Interstitial ad not loaded');
    }
  }

  // Function to show rewarded video ad
  void _showRewardedVideoAd() async {
    if (await Appodeal.isLoaded(AdType.rewardedVideo)) {
      Appodeal.show(AdType.rewardedVideo);
    } else {
      print('Rewarded video ad not loaded');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Appodeal Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _showInterstitialAd,
              child: Text('Show Interstitial Ad'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _showRewardedVideoAd,
              child: Text('Show Rewarded Video Ad'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes Appodeal with the provided app key and ad types.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, and a banner ad is shown at the top of the screen.
// 3. The user can tap the buttons to show interstitial or rewarded video ads.
// 4. When a button is pressed, the app checks if the respective ad is loaded.
// 5. If the ad is loaded, it is displayed; otherwise, a message is printed to the console.
