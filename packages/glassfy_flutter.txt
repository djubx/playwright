# Tutorial: Setting Up Glassfy Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **glassfy_flutter** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **glassfy_flutter** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  glassfy_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/glassfy_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="glassfy.apiKey"
            android:value="YOUR_GLASSFY_API_KEY" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `build.gradle` file is set up correctly. You may need to add the Glassfy SDK dependency.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the required keys in your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>glassfy.apiKey</key>
<string>YOUR_GLASSFY_API_KEY</string>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed and run `pod install` in the `ios` directory.

## Step 3: Initialize Glassfy

In your main application file, initialize the Glassfy SDK:

```dart
import 'package:glassfy_flutter/glassfy_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  Glassfy.initialize("YOUR_GLASSFY_API_KEY");
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using Glassfy

You can now use the Glassfy API to manage subscriptions and purchases. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to fetch products and handle purchases.

```dart
// Fetch available products
List<Product> products = await Glassfy.getProducts();
```

This will allow you to display available products to your users and handle their purchases accordingly.

# Complete Example of Glassfy Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:glassfy_flutter/glassfy_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Ensure Flutter bindings are initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize Glassfy with your API key
  Glassfy.initialize("YOUR_GLASSFY_API_KEY");
  
  // Run the main application
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Glassfy Flutter Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  List<Product> _products = []; // List to hold available products
  String _purchaseStatus = ""; // Variable to hold purchase status

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchProducts(); // Fetch products on initialization
  }

  // Function to fetch available products
  Future<void> _fetchProducts() async {
    try {
      // Fetch products from Glassfy
      List<Product> products = await Glassfy.getProducts();
      setState(() {
        _products = products; // Update the state with fetched products
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during product fetching
      setState(() {
        _purchaseStatus = "Error fetching products: $e";
      });
    }
  }

  // Function to handle product purchase
  Future<void> _purchaseProduct(Product product) async {
    try {
      // Initiate the purchase process
      PurchaseResult result = await Glassfy.purchase(product);
      setState(() {
        _purchaseStatus = "Purchase successful: ${result.status}"; // Update purchase status
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during purchase
      setState(() {
        _purchaseStatus = "Purchase failed: $e";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Glassfy Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the purchase status
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text(_purchaseStatus),
          ),
          // List of available products
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: _products.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                final product = _products[index];
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(product.name), // Display product name
                  subtitle: Text(product.price), // Display product price
                  onTap: () => _purchaseProduct(product), // Handle product tap
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the Glassfy package.
// 1. The application initializes the Glassfy SDK with an API key.
// 2. It fetches available products from Glassfy and displays them in a list.
// 3. When a user taps on a product, it initiates the purchase process.
// 4. The purchase status is displayed at the top of the screen, indicating success or failure.
// 5. Error handling is included to manage any issues during product fetching or purchasing.

In summary, this application flow allows users to view available in-app products and make purchases seamlessly, leveraging the capabilities of the Glassfy Flutter package.
