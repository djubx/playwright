# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Image Downloader Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `image_downloader` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_downloader: ^0.27.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission for saving images:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library to save images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:image_downloader/image_downloader.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to download images. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
Future<void> downloadImage(String imageUrl) async {
  try {
    // Requesting the image download
    var imageId = await ImageDownloader.downloadImage(imageUrl);
    // Optionally, you can retrieve the image file path
    var path = await ImageDownloader.findPath(imageId);
    print('Image saved to: $path');
  } catch (error) {
    print('Error downloading image: $error');
  }
}
```

This function takes an image URL, downloads it, and prints the path where the image is saved.

# Complete Example of Using the Image Downloader Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_downloader/image_downloader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Downloader Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Image Downloader'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // URL of the image to be downloaded
              String imageUrl = 'https://example.com/image.jpg';
              downloadImage(imageUrl);
            },
            child: Text('Download Image'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<void> downloadImage(String imageUrl) async {
    try {
      // Requesting the image download
      var imageId = await ImageDownloader.downloadImage(imageUrl);
      // Optionally, you can retrieve the image file path
      var path = await ImageDownloader.findPath(imageId);
      print('Image saved to: $path');
    } catch (error) {
      print('Error downloading image: $error');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Image Downloader'.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the downloadImage function is called with a sample image URL.
// 6. The downloadImage function attempts to download the image using the ImageDownloader package.
// 7. If successful, it prints the path where the image is saved; if an error occurs, it prints the error message.
```
