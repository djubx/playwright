# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using lexo_rank_generator

## Installation
To add the `lexo_rank_generator` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  lexo_rank_generator: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `lexo_rank_generator`, you need to import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:lexo_rank_generator/lexo_rank_generator.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and start generating ranks.

### Example Code
```dart
void main() {
  // Create an instance of the RealFlutter class
  RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();

  // Add items and generate ranks
  realFlutter.addItem('Task 1');
  realFlutter.addItem('Task 2');
  realFlutter.addItem('Task 3');

  // Print the ranked items
  print(realFlutter.getRankedItems());
}
```

This will output the items in their lexicographical order based on the ranks generated.

By following these steps, you can easily integrate the `lexo_rank_generator` package into your Flutter application and start managing ranked lists effectively.

# Complete Example of lexo_rank_generator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lexo_rank_generator/lexo_rank_generator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Lexo Rank Generator Demo',
      home: RankListScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class RankListScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RankListScreenState createState() => _RankListScreenState();
}

class _RankListScreenState extends State<RankListScreen> {
  // Create an instance of the RealFlutter class
  RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();
  List<String> rankedItems = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize with some items
    realFlutter.addItem('Task 1');
    realFlutter.addItem('Task 2');
    realFlutter.addItem('Task 3');
    // Get the ranked items
    rankedItems = realFlutter.getRankedItems();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Ranked Items'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: rankedItems.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(rankedItems[index]),
          );
        },
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Add a new item and update the ranked list
          realFlutter.addItem('Task ${rankedItems.length + 1}');
          setState(() {
            rankedItems = realFlutter.getRankedItems();
          });
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (RankListScreen).
// 3. RankListScreen is a stateful widget that manages the ranked items.
// 4. In the initState method, we initialize the RealFlutter instance and add some tasks.
// 5. The ranked items are retrieved and stored in the rankedItems list.
// 6. The build method creates a ListView to display the ranked items.
// 7. A FloatingActionButton is provided to add new tasks dynamically.
// 8. When the button is pressed, a new task is added, and the ranked list is updated.
// 9. The UI reflects the changes, showing the updated ranked items.
