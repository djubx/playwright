```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `list_country_picker`, you can create a simple widget that utilizes the country picker. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:list_country_picker/list_country_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Country Picker Example')),
        body: CountryPickerWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CountryPickerWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountryPickerWidgetState createState() => _CountryPickerWidgetState();
}

class _CountryPickerWidgetState extends State<CountryPickerWidget> {
  String? selectedCountry;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          Text(selectedCountry ?? 'Select a country'),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              final country = await showCountryPicker(context);
              if (country != null) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedCountry = country.name;
                });
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pick a Country'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<Country?> showCountryPicker(BuildContext context) {
    return showDialog<Country>(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return CountryPickerDialog();
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that opens a country picker dialog. When a user selects a country, it updates the displayed text.

# Complete Example of `list_country_picker`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:list_country_picker/list_country_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Country Picker Example')),
        body: CountryPickerWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CountryPickerWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountryPickerWidgetState createState() => _CountryPickerWidgetState();
}

class _CountryPickerWidgetState extends State<CountryPickerWidget> {
  String? selectedCountry; // Variable to hold the selected country

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          Text(selectedCountry ?? 'Select a country'), // Display selected country or prompt
          SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between text and button
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Show the country picker dialog when the button is pressed
              final country = await showCountryPicker(context);
              if (country != null) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedCountry = country.name; // Update the selected country
                });
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pick a Country'), // Button text
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<Country?> showCountryPicker(BuildContext context) {
    // Function to show the country picker dialog
    return showDialog<Country>(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return CountryPickerDialog(); // Return the country picker dialog
      },
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the RealFlutter widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// The CountryPickerWidget is displayed in the center of the screen.
// When the user presses the "Pick a Country" button, a dialog appears allowing them to select a country.
// Upon selection, the chosen country's name is displayed on the screen.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->
```

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application starts with the `RealFlutter` widget, which initializes the `MaterialApp`.
- The `CountryPickerWidget` is displayed in the center of the screen, showing either a prompt or the selected country.
- When the user clicks the "Pick a Country" button, the `showCountryPicker` function is called, which opens a dialog for country selection.
- After the user selects a country, the state is updated to reflect the chosen country, and it is displayed on the screen.

This complete example demonstrates how to effectively use the `list_country_picker` package in a Flutter application, providing a seamless user experience for country selection.
