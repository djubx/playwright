MVVM Plus Flutter Package
==========================

The `mvvm_plus` Flutter package is a powerful tool for building robust and maintainable applications using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. It provides a set of features and tools that simplify the process of building complex applications, making it easier to manage state, handle errors, and optimize performance.

When to Use MVVM Plus
--------------------

MVVM Plus is ideal for building complex applications that require a high degree of maintainability, scalability, and performance. It is particularly well-suited for applications that:

* Have a large number of features and screens
* Require complex business logic and validation
* Need to handle large amounts of data and state
* Must be highly customizable and configurable

Features of MVVM Plus
--------------------

Some of the key features of MVVM Plus include:

* **ViewModel**: A simple and intuitive way to manage state and business logic
* **Repository**: A centralized location for data storage and retrieval
* **Navigator**: A powerful navigation system for managing screen transitions
* **ErrorHandler**: A built-in error handling system for catching and handling exceptions

Setting Up MVVM Plus
--------------------

To get started with MVVM Plus, you'll need to add the package to your Flutter project. You can do this by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  mvvm_plus: ^1.0.0
```
Next, you'll need to import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:mvvm_plus/mvvm_plus.dart';
```
Creating a ViewModel
--------------------

To create a ViewModel, you'll need to extend the `ViewModel` class and override the `init` method:
```dart
class RealFlutterViewModel extends ViewModel {
  @override
  void init() {
    // Initialize your ViewModel here
  }
}
```
Creating a Repository
---------------------

To create a Repository, you'll need to extend the `Repository` class and override the `init` method:
```dart
class RealFlutterRepository extends Repository {
  @override
  void init() {
    // Initialize your Repository here
  }
}
```
Configuring the Navigator
-------------------------

To configure the Navigator, you'll need to create a `Navigator` instance and pass it to the `MaterialApp` constructor:
```dart
Navigator navigator = Navigator();

MaterialApp(
  title: 'RealFlutter',
  home: RealFlutterHomeScreen(),
  navigator: navigator,
);
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mvvm_plus/mvvm_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'RealFlutter',
      home: RealFlutterHomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutterHomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterHomeScreenState createState() => _RealFlutterHomeScreenState();
}

class _RealFlutterHomeScreenState extends State<RealFlutterHomeScreen> {
  RealFlutterViewModel _viewModel;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _viewModel = RealFlutterViewModel();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('RealFlutter'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to RealFlutter'),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          _viewModel.navigateToNextScreen();
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutterViewModel extends ViewModel {
  @override
  void init() {
    // Initialize your ViewModel here
  }

  void navigateToNextScreen() {
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => RealFlutterNextScreen()),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutterNextScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('RealFlutter Next Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to RealFlutter Next Screen'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user launches the app and is presented with the RealFlutterHomeScreen.
// 2. The user clicks the floating action button, which triggers the navigateToNextScreen method on the RealFlutterViewModel.
// 3. The navigateToNextScreen method pushes the RealFlutterNextScreen onto the navigation stack.
// 4. The user is presented with the RealFlutterNextScreen.
```

// The code flow is a simple navigation flow, where the user can navigate from the home screen to the next screen by clicking the floating action button. The navigation is handled by the ViewModel, which uses the Navigator to push the next screen onto the navigation stack. The next screen is a simple scaffold with a title and a body.
