# Overview of the simple_rc4 Flutter Package

The `simple_rc4` package is a lightweight and straightforward implementation of the RC4 encryption algorithm for Flutter applications. RC4 is a stream cipher that is widely used for encrypting data due to its simplicity and speed. This package is particularly useful when you need to secure sensitive information, such as user credentials or personal data, in your Flutter applications.

## When to Use `simple_rc4`
- **Data Encryption**: When you need to encrypt sensitive data before storing it or transmitting it over the network.
- **Secure Communication**: For applications that require secure communication channels, such as messaging apps.
- **Lightweight Encryption**: When you need a fast and efficient encryption method without the overhead of more complex algorithms.

## Features
- **Easy to Use**: The package provides a simple API for encryption and decryption.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and a small footprint make it suitable for mobile applications.
- **Stream Cipher**: RC4 is a stream cipher, which means it can encrypt data of any length efficiently.

# Setting Up and Using the simple_rc4 Package

## Installation
To use the `simple_rc4` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  simple_rc4: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 16 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you are accessing sensitive data. However, no specific configurations are needed for the `simple_rc4` package itself.

## Usage
To use the `simple_rc4` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:simple_rc4/simple_rc4.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class to perform encryption and decryption.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to encrypt and decrypt a string using the `simple_rc4` package:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create an instance of the RealFlutter class
  final rc4 = RealFlutter();

  // Define a key and a plaintext message
  String key = "my_secret_key";
  String plaintext = "Hello, Flutter!";

  // Encrypt the plaintext
  String encrypted = rc4.encrypt(plaintext, key);
  print("Encrypted: $encrypted");

  // Decrypt the message
  String decrypted = rc4.decrypt(encrypted, key);
  print("Decrypted: $decrypted");
}
```

This example demonstrates the basic functionality of the `simple_rc4` package, allowing you to encrypt and decrypt messages easily.

# Complete Example of Using simple_rc4

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_rc4/simple_rc4.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'RC4 Encryption Example',
      home: EncryptionDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class EncryptionDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EncryptionDemoState createState() => _EncryptionDemoState();
}

class _EncryptionDemoState extends State<EncryptionDemo> {
  final RealFlutter rc4 = RealFlutter(); // Create an instance of RealFlutter
  String key = "my_secret_key"; // Define the encryption key
  String plaintext = "Hello, Flutter!"; // The message to encrypt
  String encrypted = ""; // Variable to hold the encrypted message
  String decrypted = ""; // Variable to hold the decrypted message

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    encryptMessage(); // Call the method to encrypt the message on initialization
  }

  void encryptMessage() {
    // Encrypt the plaintext message
    encrypted = rc4.encrypt(plaintext, key);
    // Decrypt the message
    decrypted = rc4.decrypt(encrypted, key);
    // Update the UI with the encrypted and decrypted messages
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('RC4 Encryption Demo'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Plaintext: $plaintext'), // Display the original message
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            Text('Encrypted: $encrypted'), // Display the encrypted message
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            Text('Decrypted: $decrypted'), // Display the decrypted message
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The application starts by running the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// Inside MyApp, we define a home widget called EncryptionDemo.
// In the EncryptionDemo state, we create an instance of RealFlutter for encryption.
// We define a key and a plaintext message to be encrypted.
// In the initState method, we call encryptMessage to perform encryption and decryption.
// The encryptMessage method uses the rc4 instance to encrypt the plaintext and then decrypt it.
// Finally, we update the UI to display the original, encrypted, and decrypted messages.
