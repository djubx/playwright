# Overview of the hid4flutter Package

The `hid4flutter` package is a Flutter plugin that provides a way to interact with Human Interface Devices (HID) such as keyboards, mice, and game controllers. This package is particularly useful for applications that require direct communication with these devices, enabling developers to create rich user experiences that leverage hardware input.

## When to Use hid4flutter
- **Gaming Applications**: If you're developing a game that requires input from game controllers, `hid4flutter` can help you capture and respond to user inputs effectively.
- **Custom Input Devices**: For applications that utilize custom HID devices, this package allows you to read and interpret data from those devices.
- **Accessibility Tools**: If you're building tools that enhance accessibility, you can use this package to integrate various input devices that assist users.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, allowing for a wide range of applications.
- **Real-time Input Handling**: Provides real-time access to input events from HID devices.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that makes it easy to integrate into existing Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using hid4flutter

## Installation
To add the `hid4flutter` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  hid4flutter: ^latest_version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow your app to access USB devices:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USB_PERMISSION"/>
```

3. Ensure you have the correct SDK version in your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    compileSdkVersion 31
    ...
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request permission to access HID devices:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to HID devices.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initialize the `hid4flutter` package and listen for input events.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hid4flutter/hid4flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize HID device listener
    Hid4Flutter.startListening((event) {
      // Handle HID input event
      print('HID Event: $event');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('HID4Flutter Example')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Listening for HID events...')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of hid4flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hid4flutter/hid4flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the latest HID event
  String _latestEvent = 'No events yet';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start listening for HID events
    Hid4Flutter.startListening((event) {
      // Update the state with the latest event
      setState(() {
        _latestEvent = event.toString();
      });
      // Print the event to the console
      print('HID Event: $event');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('HID4Flutter Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('Latest HID Event:'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(_latestEvent), // Display the latest event
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, we call Hid4Flutter.startListening to begin listening for HID events.
// 3. When an event is detected, we update the _latestEvent variable and call setState to refresh the UI.
// 4. The latest HID event is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 5. The app continues to listen for events until it is closed.
