```

## Using the Package
To use the `flutter_top_blocked_bouncing_scroll_physics`, you can apply it to any scrollable widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it in a `ListView`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_top_blocked_bouncing_scroll_physics/flutter_top_blocked_bouncing_scroll_physics.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Bouncing Scroll Example'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        physics: TopBlockedBouncingScrollPhysics(), // Apply the custom scroll physics
        itemCount: 50,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text('Item $index'),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple `ListView` that uses the `TopBlockedBouncingScrollPhysics` to provide a bouncing effect when the user scrolls to the top of the list.

# Complete Example of flutter_top_blocked_bouncing_scroll_physics

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_top_blocked_bouncing_scroll_physics/flutter_top_blocked_bouncing_scroll_physics.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bouncing Scroll Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Bouncing Scroll Example'), // Title of the app
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        physics: TopBlockedBouncingScrollPhysics(), // Apply the custom scroll physics
        itemCount: 50, // Number of items in the list
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text('Item $index'), // Display item number
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a ListView.
// 4. The ListView uses TopBlockedBouncingScrollPhysics for a custom scroll effect.
// 5. The ListView.builder creates 50 ListTile widgets, each displaying its index.
// 6. When the user scrolls to the top, a bouncing effect is triggered, enhancing the user experience.
