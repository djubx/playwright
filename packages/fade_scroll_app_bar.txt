# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Fade Scroll App Bar

## Installation
To use the `fade_scroll_app_bar` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fade_scroll_app_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific features. However, the `fade_scroll_app_bar` package does not require any additional configurations.

## Basic Usage
To use the `fade_scroll_app_bar`, you need to wrap your scrollable content with the `FadeScrollAppBar` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fade_scroll_app_bar/fade_scroll_app_bar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: FadeScrollAppBar(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Fade Scroll App Bar'),
        ),
        body: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 100,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text('Item $index'),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `FadeScrollAppBar` widget takes an `AppBar` and a scrollable body (in this case, a `ListView`). As you scroll through the list, the app bar will fade in and out smoothly.

# Complete Example of Fade Scroll App Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fade_scroll_app_bar/fade_scroll_app_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        // The main scaffold of the app
        body: FadeScrollAppBar(
          // The FadeScrollAppBar widget that handles the fading effect
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: Text('Fade Scroll App Bar Example'),
            // The title of the app bar
          ),
          body: ListView.builder(
            // A ListView to display a list of items
            itemCount: 100, // Total number of items
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'), // Displaying item number
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold, which is the basic layout structure.
// 4. Inside the Scaffold, we use the FadeScrollAppBar widget.
// 5. The FadeScrollAppBar takes an AppBar and a scrollable body (ListView).
// 6. As the user scrolls through the ListView, the app bar fades in and out,
//    creating a smooth transition effect that enhances the user experience.
