# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Icons Flutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `icons_flutter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  icons_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:icons_flutter/icons_flutter.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Icons in Your Application

You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s how to use an icon in a `Container`:

```dart
Container(
  child: Icon(
    IconsFlutter.home, // Replace with the desired icon
    size: 50.0, // Set the size of the icon
    color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the icon
  ),
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` if you are using custom icons:

```xml
<key>UIAppFonts</key>
<array>
    <string>CustomIconFont.ttf</string> <!-- Replace with your font file -->
</array>
```

## Optimizations

- **Icon Size**: Use the `size` property to ensure icons are appropriately sized for different devices.
- **Color Customization**: Utilize the `color` property to match your app's theme.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate and utilize the `icons_flutter` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Icons Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:icons_flutter/icons_flutter.dart'; // Importing the icons_flutter package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Icons Flutter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Icons Flutter Demo'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a home icon
              Icon(
                IconsFlutter.home, // Using the home icon from icons_flutter
                size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a settings icon
              Icon(
                IconsFlutter.settings, // Using the settings icon from icons_flutter
                size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a profile icon
              Icon(
                IconsFlutter.person, // Using the person icon from icons_flutter
                size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() to start the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class extends StatelessWidget and builds the UI using the build method.
// 3. A MaterialApp widget is created with a title and a home property that defines the main screen.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 6. A Column widget is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 7. Each Icon widget displays an icon from the icons_flutter package, with specified size and color.
// 8. SizedBox widgets are used to add spacing between the icons for better visual separation.
```
