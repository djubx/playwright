# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Alphabetical Scroll Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **alphabetical_scroll** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **alphabetical_scroll** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  alphabetical_scroll: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement the alphabetical scroll feature.

# Complete Example of Using the Alphabetical Scroll Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alphabetical_scroll/alphabetical_scroll.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Alphabetical Scroll Example',
      home: AlphabeticalScrollExample(),
    );
  }
}

class AlphabeticalScrollExample extends StatelessWidget {
  // Sample data for the list
  final List<String> items = List.generate(100, (index) => 'Item ${String.fromCharCode(65 + index % 26)}');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Alphabetical Scroll Example'),
      ),
      body: AlphabeticalScroll(
        items: items,
        itemBuilder: (context, item) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(item),
          );
        },
        // Customizing the scroll indicator
        scrollIndicatorBuilder: (context, index) {
          return Container(
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: Text(
              String.fromCharCode(65 + index),
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. AlphabeticalScrollExample is the home widget, which contains a list of items generated from A to Z.
// 4. The AlphabeticalScroll widget is used to display the list with a scroll indicator.
// 5. The itemBuilder creates ListTile widgets for each item in the list.
// 6. The scrollIndicatorBuilder customizes the appearance of the scroll indicators, displaying letters A-Z.
// 7. The app provides a smooth and intuitive way for users to navigate through the list of items.
