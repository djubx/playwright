# Tutorial: Setting Up Flare Loading

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **flare_loading** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the **flare_loading** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flare_loading: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Flare
You also need to add the **flare_flutter** package to your dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flare_flutter: ^3.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the packages.

## Step 3: Configure for iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the following in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

This ensures compatibility with the Flare animations.

## Step 4: Configure for Android
For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21  // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

## Step 5: Using Flare Loading
Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to implement a loading animation using the **flare_loading** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flare_loading/flare_loading.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flare Loading Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FlareLoading(
            'assets/loading.flr', // Path to your Flare animation file
            size: 100.0, // Size of the loading animation
            color: Colors.blue, // Color of the animation
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a Flare loading animation at the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of Flare Loading

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flare_loading/flare_loading.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flare Loading Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the loading animation
          child: FlareLoading(
            'assets/loading.flr', // Path to your Flare animation file
            size: 100.0, // Size of the loading animation
            color: Colors.blue, // Color of the animation
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Flare Loading Example'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold is centered using a Center widget.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, a FlareLoading widget is used to display the loading animation.
// 7. The FlareLoading widget takes the path to the Flare animation file, its size, and color as parameters.
// 8. When the app runs, it displays the loading animation at the center of the screen.
```
