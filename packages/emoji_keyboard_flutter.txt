<-- END_MAIN -->

In summary, the code flows as follows:

1. The app starts by running the `main` function, which creates an instance of the `RealFlutter` class.
2. The `RealFlutter` class is a stateful widget that contains a `TextEditingController` instance.
3. The `build` method is called to create the app's layout, which consists of a `TextField` and an `EmojiKeyboard`.
4. The `EmojiKeyboard` instance is created by passing the `TextEditingController` instance to the `EmojiKeyboard` constructor.
5. The `EmojiKeyboard` is then added to the app's layout, allowing the user to input emojis into the `TextField`.
