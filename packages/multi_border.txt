  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Multi Border Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: MultiBorder(
          border: Border.all(color: Colors.blue, width: 4),
          child: Container(
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
            child: Text('Hello, Multi Border!'),
          ),

  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

# Complete Example of Multi_Border

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multi_border/multi_border.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Multi Border Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Multi Border Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: MultiBorder(
          // Setting multiple borders with different styles and colors
          borders: [
            BorderSide(color: Colors.red, width: 5, style: BorderStyle.solid), // Solid red border
            BorderSide(color: Colors.green, width: 3, style: BorderStyle.dashed), // Dashed green border
            BorderSide(color: Colors.blue, width: 1, style: BorderStyle.dotted), // Dotted blue border
          ],
          child: Container(
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
            color: Colors.white,
            child: Text(
              'Hello, Multi Border!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, MultiBorder is used to wrap a Container.
// 5. The MultiBorder widget is configured with three different borders: solid red, dashed green, and dotted blue.
// 6. The Container has padding and a white background, displaying the text "Hello, Multi Border!".
// 7. The result is a visually appealing widget with multiple borders, showcasing the capabilities of the multi_border package.
