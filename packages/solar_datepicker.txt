# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Solar DatePicker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the solar_datepicker package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the solar_datepicker package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  solar_datepicker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include permissions for using the date picker. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the calendar.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Solar DatePicker

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the solar_datepicker in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:solar_datepicker/solar_datepicker.dart';
```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the selected date:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  DateTime? selectedDate;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Solar DatePicker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              selectedDate != null
                  ? 'Selected Date: ${selectedDate!.toLocal()}'
                  : 'No Date Selected',
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Show the solar date picker
                DateTime? date = await showSolarDatePicker(
                  context: context,
                  initialDate: DateTime.now(),
                  firstDate: DateTime(2000),
                  lastDate: DateTime(2100),
                );
                // Update the selected date
                if (date != null) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedDate = date;
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick a Solar Date'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, run your app and test the solar date picker!

This setup provides a basic implementation of the solar date picker in a Flutter application. You can further customize the appearance and behavior as needed.

# Complete Example of Solar DatePicker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:solar_datepicker/solar_datepicker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  DateTime? selectedDate; // Variable to hold the selected date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Solar DatePicker Example'), // App title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected date or a message if no date is selected
            Text(
              selectedDate != null
                  ? 'Selected Date: ${selectedDate!.toLocal()}'
                  : 'No Date Selected',
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between elements
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Show the solar date picker when the button is pressed
                DateTime? date = await showSolarDatePicker(
                  context: context,
                  initialDate: DateTime.now(), // Set the initial date to today
                  firstDate: DateTime(2000), // Set the earliest selectable date
                  lastDate: DateTime(2100), // Set the latest selectable date
                );
                // Update the selected date if a date was picked
                if (date != null) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedDate = date; // Update the state with the new date
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick a Solar Date'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a stateful widget that manages the selected date.
// 3. In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The Center widget contains a Column that displays the selected date or a message.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is provided to trigger the solar date picker.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the showSolarDatePicker function is called.
// 7. If a date is selected, the state is updated, and the UI reflects the new date.
