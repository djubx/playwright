// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application and is presented with a text editor.
// 2. The user can type text into the editor, which is managed by the ParchmentController instance.
// 3. When the user presses the floating action button, the ParchmentController instance inserts the text 'Hello, World!' at the current cursor position.
// 4. The ParchmentEditor widget displays the text and allows the user to edit it.
// 5. The ParchmentDelta instance manages the text document and provides the necessary functionality for the ParchmentController instance.

// In summary, the Parchment Delta package provides a powerful and flexible way to manage text documents in Flutter applications. The package includes a range of features, including a delta-based document model, rich text support, and customizable document models. The example application demonstrates how to use the package to create a simple text editor with a floating action button that inserts text at the current cursor position.
