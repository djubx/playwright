# Parchment Delta: A Comprehensive Overview

The **parchment_delta** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to manage and manipulate rich text documents. It provides a way to represent and apply changes to text in a structured format, making it ideal for applications that require collaborative editing, text formatting, or any scenario where text needs to be dynamically updated.

## When to Use Parchment Delta
- **Collaborative Text Editing**: If your application allows multiple users to edit text simultaneously, this package can help manage the changes efficiently.
- **Rich Text Formatting**: For applications that require text styling (bold, italics, etc.), parchment_delta can handle these formats seamlessly.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: The package supports operations that can be easily undone or redone, enhancing user experience in text editing applications.

## Key Features
- **Delta Representation**: Represents text changes in a delta format, allowing for efficient updates.
- **Rich Text Support**: Supports various text styles and formats.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate with existing Flutter applications.
- **Undo/Redo Operations**: Built-in support for undoing and redoing text changes.

Overall, parchment_delta is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement advanced text editing features in their Flutter applications.

# Parchment Delta: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the parchment_delta package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  parchment_delta: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/parchment_delta).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow for any specific permissions your app might require, although parchment_delta itself does not require special permissions.

## Basic Usage
To use the parchment_delta package, you will typically create a `RealFlutter` class that manages the text editing functionality. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:parchment_delta/parchment_delta.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  Delta _delta = Delta()..insert('Hello, World!\n');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Parchment Delta Example')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: SingleChildScrollView(
              child: Text(_delta.toJson().toString()), // Displaying the delta
            ),
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _addText,
            child: Text('Add Text'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  void _addText() {
    setState(() {
      _delta.insert('New text added!\n'); // Modifying the delta
    });
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a text area and a button to add new text. The `_delta` variable holds the current state of the text, and we update it when the button is pressed.

This setup provides a basic understanding of how to integrate and use the parchment_delta package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Parchment Delta in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:parchment_delta/parchment_delta.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Parchment Delta Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize a Delta object to hold the text changes
  Delta _delta = Delta()..insert('Hello, World!\n');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Parchment Delta Example')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the current state of the delta in a scrollable view
          Expanded(
            child: SingleChildScrollView(
              child: Text(_delta.toJson().toString()), // Show the delta as JSON
            ),
          ),
          // Button to add new text to the delta
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _addText,
            child: Text('Add Text'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to add new text to the delta
  void _addText() {
    setState(() {
      _delta.insert('New text added!\n'); // Insert new text into the delta
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and points to the RealFlutter widget as the home.
// 3. In RealFlutter, we initialize a Delta object with some initial text.
// 4. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Column.
// 5. The Column contains a SingleChildScrollView to display the current state of the delta.
// 6. An ElevatedButton is provided to add new text to the delta.
// 7. When the button is pressed, the _addText function is called, which updates the delta and refreshes the UI.
