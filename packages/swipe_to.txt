# Swipe_to Flutter Package: An Overview

The `swipe_to` Flutter package is a versatile tool designed to enhance user interaction by enabling swipe gestures in your Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful when you want to implement swipe-to-dismiss, swipe-to-reveal, or any custom swipe actions in your app. It provides a simple and intuitive API to integrate swipe gestures seamlessly.

## When to Use `swipe_to`

- **Swipe-to-Dismiss**: Ideal for list items where users can swipe to delete or archive an item.
- **Swipe-to-Reveal**: Use it to reveal hidden options like edit, delete, or share when a user swipes an item.
- **Custom Swipe Actions**: Implement any custom action that should be triggered by a swipe gesture.

## Features

- **Customizable Swipe Actions**: Define what happens when a swipe is detected.
- **Direction Control**: Specify swipe directions (left, right, up, down).
- **Thresholds and Sensitivity**: Adjust the sensitivity and threshold for swipe detection.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates with existing widgets.

# Setting Up and Using the `swipe_to` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `swipe_to` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**

   Add the `swipe_to` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     swipe_to: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install the Package**

   Run the following command to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Import the Package**

   Import the package in your Dart file where you plan to use it:

   ```dart
   import 'package:swipe_to/swipe_to.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

  ```gradle
  defaultConfig {
      minSdkVersion 21
  }
  ```

### iOS

- No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:

  ```ruby
  platform :ios, '9.0'
  ```

## Using the Package

To use the `swipe_to` package, wrap your widget with the `SwipeTo` widget and define the swipe action:

```dart
SwipeTo(
  onSwipe: () {
    // Define the action to perform on swipe
    print('Swiped!');
  },
  child: RealFlutter(
    // Your widget here
  ),
);
```

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `swipe_to` package. This example demonstrates how to implement swipe-to-dismiss functionality.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:swipe_to/swipe_to.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SwipeTo Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: SwipeDemoPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SwipeDemoPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SwipeTo Example'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: 10,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return SwipeTo(
            onSwipe: () {
              // Action to perform on swipe
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Item $index dismissed')),
              );
            },
            child: RealFlutter(
              index: index,
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  final int index;

  RealFlutter({required this.index});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      margin: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 8.0, horizontal: 16.0),
      child: ListTile(
        title: Text('Item $index'),
        subtitle: Text('Swipe to dismiss this item'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by calling `runApp` with `MyApp`.
// 2. `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is `SwipeDemoPage`, which is a stateless widget displaying a list of items.
// 4. `SwipeDemoPage` uses a `ListView.builder` to create a list of 10 items.
// 5. Each item is wrapped in a `SwipeTo` widget, which listens for swipe gestures.
// 6. On a swipe, a `SnackBar` is shown to indicate the item has been dismissed.
// 7. `RealFlutter` is a stateless widget representing each list item, displaying the item index and a subtitle.
// 8. The `SwipeTo` widget is configured to trigger an action when a swipe is detected, enhancing user interaction.
