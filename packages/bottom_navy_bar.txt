# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bottom_navy_bar/bottom_navy_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bottom Navy Bar Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to keep track of the selected index
  int _selectedIndex = 0;

  // List of widgets to display for each tab
  final List<Widget> _screens = [
    HomeScreen(),
    SearchScreen(),
    ProfileScreen(),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Bottom Navy Bar Example'),
      ),
      body: _screens[_selectedIndex], // Display the selected screen
      bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavyBar(
        selectedIndex: _selectedIndex, // Current selected index
        onItemSelected: (index) {
          setState(() {
            _selectedIndex = index; // Update the selected index
          });
        },
        items: [
          BottomNavyBarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.home),
            title: Text('Home'),
            activeColor: Colors.blue,
            inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
          ),
          BottomNavyBarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.search),
            title: Text('Search'),
            activeColor: Colors.blue,
            inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
          ),
          BottomNavyBarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.person),
            title: Text('Profile'),
            activeColor: Colors.blue,
            inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text('Home Screen', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
    );
  }
}

// Search screen widget
class SearchScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text('Search Screen', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
    );
  }
}

// Profile screen widget
class ProfileScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text('Profile Screen', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages the selected index for the bottom navigation bar.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold displays the currently selected screen based on the _selectedIndex variable.
// 5. The BottomNavyBar widget is configured with items and an onItemSelected callback to update the selected index.
// 6. Each tab corresponds to a different screen (Home, Search, Profile), which are displayed in the body of the Scaffold.
