Here's a detailed technical blog on the "ferry_generator" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `ferry_generator` package is a powerful tool for generating code that simplifies the process of working with GraphQL in Flutter applications. It provides a way to define your GraphQL queries and mutations in a type-safe manner, allowing developers to leverage the benefits of Dart's strong typing system. This package is particularly useful when building applications that require complex data interactions with a GraphQL backend.

## When to Use `ferry_generator`

You should consider using `ferry_generator` in scenarios such as:

- **Building Flutter applications that interact with GraphQL APIs**: If your app needs to fetch, mutate, or subscribe to data from a GraphQL server, this package can streamline the process.
- **Type safety**: When you want to ensure that your queries and mutations are type-checked at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
- **Code generation**: If you prefer to write less boilerplate code and want to automate the generation of data models and query classes.

## Features

- **Type-safe GraphQL queries and mutations**: Automatically generates Dart classes for your GraphQL operations.
- **Integration with the `ferry` package**: Works seamlessly with the `ferry` package for executing queries and managing state.
- **Customizable code generation**: Allows for customization of the generated code to fit your project's needs.

# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `ferry_generator` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependencies

Add the following dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ferry: ^0.7.0
  ferry_generator: ^0.7.0
  build_runner: ^2.0.0
  json_serializable: ^6.0.0
```

### Step 2: Create GraphQL Schema

You need to define your GraphQL schema. Create a file named `schema.graphql` in your project root and define your types, queries, and mutations.

### Step 3: Create Queries and Mutations

Create a directory named `graphql` and add your GraphQL queries and mutations in `.graphql` files. For example, create a file named `get_users.graphql`:

```graphql
query GetUsers {
  users {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Configure Code Generation

In your `build.yaml` file, configure the `ferry_generator`:

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      ferry_generator:
        options:
          schema: schema.graphql
```

### Step 5: Run Code Generation

Run the following command to generate the necessary Dart files:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the following:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package

Once the setup is complete, you can start using the generated classes in your Flutter application. Import the generated files and use them to execute queries and mutations.

```dart
import 'package:ferry/ferry.dart';
import 'package:your_project/graphql/get_users.data.gql.dart';
import 'package:your_project/graphql/get_users.req.gql.dart';
import 'package:your_project/graphql/get_users.var.gql.dart';
```

You can now create a `RealFlutter` class that utilizes these generated classes to fetch data from your GraphQL API.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ferry/ferry.dart';
import 'package:ferry_flutter/ferry_flutter.dart';
import 'package:your_project/graphql/get_users.data.gql.dart';
import 'package:your_project/graphql/get_users.req.gql.dart';
import 'package:your_project/graphql/get_users.var.gql.dart';
import 'package:your_project/graphql/schema.schema.gql.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a client to connect to the GraphQL server
    final client = Client(
      link: HttpLink('https://your-graphql-endpoint.com/graphql'),
      cache: Cache(),
    );

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ferry Generator Example',
      home: FerryProvider(
        client: client,
        child: UserListScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class UserListScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a request for the GetUsers query
    final request = GGetUsersReq((b) => b..vars = GGetUsersVars());

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('User List'),
      ),
      body: Query(
        request: request,
        builder: (result, {refetch, fetchMore}) {
          // Check for loading state
          if (result.isLoading) {
            return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
          }

          // Check for errors
          if (result.hasErrors) {
            return Center(child: Text('Error: ${result.errors}'));
          }

          // Extract user data from the result
          final users = result.data?.users ?? [];

          return ListView.builder(
            itemCount: users.length,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              final user = users[index];
              return ListTile(
                title: Text(user.name),
                subtitle: Text(user.email),
              );
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget creates a GraphQL client and sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The UserListScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 4. Inside UserListScreen, a GraphQL query is created to fetch users.
// 5. The Query widget listens for the request and handles loading, error, and data states.
// 6. If data is available, it displays the list of users in a ListView.
```
