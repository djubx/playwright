# Complete Example of Using Video Shop Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_shop_flutter/video_shop_flutter.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Video Shop',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: VideoShopHome(), // Set the home to VideoShopHome widget
    );
  }
}

class VideoShopHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoShopHomeState createState() => _VideoShopHomeState();
}

class _VideoShopHomeState extends State<VideoShopHome> {
  List<Video> videos = []; // List to hold video data

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    fetchVideos(); // Fetch videos when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to fetch videos from the video shop
  void fetchVideos() async {
    // Simulate fetching data from a video shop API
    videos = await VideoShopAPI.getVideos(); // Call the API to get videos
    setState(() {}); // Update the state to refresh the UI
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Shop'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: videos.isEmpty
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator while fetching
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: videos.length, // Number of videos
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(videos[index].title), // Display video title
                  subtitle: Text(videos[index].description), // Display video description
                  trailing: Text('\$${videos[index].rentalPrice}'), // Display rental price
                  onTap: () {
                    // Handle video rental
                    rentVideo(videos[index]);
                  },
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }

  // Function to handle video rental
  void rentVideo(Video video) {
    // Logic to rent the video
    VideoShopAPI.rentVideo(video.id); // Call the API to rent the video
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(content: Text('Rented: ${video.title}')), // Show confirmation message
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The VideoShopHome widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. In the VideoShopHome widget, the fetchVideos() function is called in initState to load video data.
// 4. The videos are fetched from the VideoShopAPI and stored in the videos list.
// 5. The UI is updated to display a loading indicator while fetching data.
// 6. Once the data is fetched, a ListView is built to display the list of videos.
// 7. Each video is displayed as a ListTile with a title, description, and rental price.
// 8. Tapping on a video calls the rentVideo() function, which handles the rental process and shows a confirmation message.
