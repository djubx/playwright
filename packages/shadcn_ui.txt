# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using shadcn_ui

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `shadcn_ui` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  shadcn_ui: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using its features:

```dart
import 'package:shadcn_ui/shadcn_ui.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using shadcn_ui Widgets

You can now start using the widgets provided by the `shadcn_ui` package in your Flutter application. For example, you can create a simple button using the `ShadcnButton` widget:

```dart
ShadcnButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  child: Text('Click Me'),
);
```

This is just a basic example, but the package offers a wide range of widgets to explore. Check the official documentation for more details on available components and their usage.

# Complete Example of shadcn_ui

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shadcn_ui/shadcn_ui.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'shadcn_ui Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('shadcn_ui Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ShadcnButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a snackbar when the button is pressed
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Click Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. HomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a ShadcnButton is created.
// 6. When the button is pressed, a Snackbar is displayed at the bottom of the screen, indicating that the button was pressed.
