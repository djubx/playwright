# Tutorial: Setting Up Tinkoff Acquiring in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **tinkoff_acquiring** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **tinkoff_acquiring** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tinkoff_acquiring: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/tinkoff_acquiring).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, import the package and initialize it:

```dart
import 'package:tinkoff_acquiring/tinkoff_acquiring.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  TinkoffAcquiring.init('YOUR_TERMINAL_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY');
}
```

Replace `YOUR_TERMINAL_KEY` and `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your actual Tinkoff terminal credentials.

## Step 4: Implement Payment Processing

You can now implement payment processing in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate a payment:

```dart
void initiatePayment() async {
  final payment = await TinkoffAcquiring.createPayment(
    amount: 1000, // Amount in kopecks
    orderId: 'order_12345',
    description: 'Payment for order 12345',
    // Add other parameters as needed
  );

  if (payment.success) {
    // Handle successful payment
  } else {
    // Handle payment failure
  }
}
```

This function creates a payment request with the specified amount and order details.

With these steps, you have successfully set up the **tinkoff_acquiring** package in your Flutter application. You can now proceed to implement the payment features as needed.

# Complete Example of Tinkoff Acquiring in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tinkoff_acquiring/tinkoff_acquiring.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  // Initialize Tinkoff Acquiring with your terminal and secret keys
  TinkoffAcquiring.init('YOUR_TERMINAL_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY');
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tinkoff Acquiring Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Payment Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            initiatePayment();
          },
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void initiatePayment() async {
    // Create a payment request with the specified amount and order details
    final payment = await TinkoffAcquiring.createPayment(
      amount: 1000, // Amount in kopecks (10.00 RUB)
      orderId: 'order_12345',
      description: 'Payment for order 12345',
      // Add other parameters as needed
    );

    // Check if the payment was successful
    if (payment.success) {
      // Handle successful payment
      print('Payment successful: ${payment.paymentId}');
    } else {
      // Handle payment failure
      print('Payment failed: ${payment.errorMessage}');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the Tinkoff Acquiring package with the terminal and secret keys.
// 2. The main screen displays a button labeled "Pay Now".
// 3. When the button is pressed, the `initiatePayment` function is called.
// 4. This function creates a payment request with the specified amount and order details.
// 5. The app checks if the payment was successful and prints the result to the console.
```
