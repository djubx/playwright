# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `hero_text`

## Installation
To use the `hero_text` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hero_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific permissions related to text rendering or animations.

## Basic Usage
To use the `hero_text` package, you will wrap your text widgets with the `HeroText` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hero_text/hero_text.dart';

class FirstScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('First Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: HeroText(
          tag: 'hero-text',
          child: Text(
            'Hello, Flutter!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 32, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: HeroText(
          tag: 'hero-text',
          child: Text(
            'Hello, Flutter!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when you navigate from `FirstScreen` to `SecondScreen`, the text "Hello, Flutter!" will animate smoothly between the two screens.

# Complete Example of Using `hero_text`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hero_text/hero_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Hero Text Example',
      home: FirstScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FirstScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('First Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: GestureDetector(
          // Detects taps on the text
          onTap: () {
            // Navigates to the second screen
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
            );
          },
          child: HeroText(
            tag: 'hero-text', // Unique tag for the Hero animation
            child: Text(
              'Hello, Flutter!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 32, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: HeroText(
          tag: 'hero-text', // Same tag as in FirstScreen
          child: Text(
            'Hello, Flutter!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home screen is FirstScreen, which displays a text "Hello, Flutter!" wrapped in HeroText.
// 3. When the user taps on the text, it triggers the onTap function.
// 4. The onTap function uses Navigator.push to navigate to SecondScreen.
// 5. In SecondScreen, the same text is displayed with a larger font size, also wrapped in HeroText.
// 6. The Hero animation occurs because both HeroText widgets share the same tag, creating a smooth transition effect.
