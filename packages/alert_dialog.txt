# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `alert_dialog` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `alert_dialog` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  alert_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the alert dialog, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:alert_dialog/alert_dialog.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Alert Dialog

### Basic Usage

You can create a simple alert dialog using the following code snippet:

```dart
showDialog(
  context: context,
  builder: (BuildContext context) {
    return AlertDialog(
      title: Text("Alert Title"),
      content: Text("This is the alert message."),
      actions: [
        TextButton(
          child: Text("Cancel"),
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
          },
        ),
        TextButton(
          child: Text("OK"),
          onPressed: () {
            // Perform action on OK
            Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  },
);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: The `alert_dialog` package works out of the box on Android. Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions if you are performing actions that require them.
  
- **iOS**: Similarly, on iOS, the package functions without additional configuration. However, ensure that your app adheres to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for alerts.

### Optimizations

- **Theming**: You can customize the dialog's theme to match your app's design by using the `ThemeData` class.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that your dialogs are accessible by providing appropriate labels and hints for screen readers.

By following these steps, you can effectively implement the `alert_dialog` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the `alert_dialog` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alert_dialog/alert_dialog.dart'; // Importing the alert_dialog package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Alert Dialog Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Alert Dialog Demo'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Triggering the alert dialog when the button is pressed
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (BuildContext context) {
                  return AlertDialog(
                    title: Text("Confirm Action"), // Title of the dialog
                    content: Text("Are you sure you want to proceed?"), // Content message
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        child: Text("Cancel"), // Cancel button
                        onPressed: () {
                          Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                        },
                      ),
                      TextButton(
                        child: Text("OK"), // OK button
                        onPressed: () {
                          // Action to perform on OK
                          print("User confirmed the action."); // Log confirmation
                          Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                        },
                      ),
                    ],
                  );
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Alert Dialog'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, there's a Center widget containing an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers the showDialog function.
// 5. The showDialog function displays an AlertDialog with a title, content, and two buttons (Cancel and OK).
// 6. Pressing Cancel closes the dialog without any action.
// 7. Pressing OK logs a confirmation message to the console and closes the dialog.
