# Exploring the "jeodezi" Flutter Package

The **jeodezi** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to work with geodesy and geospatial calculations. This package provides a range of functionalities that allow developers to perform various geodetic computations, such as distance calculations, coordinate transformations, and more. 

## When to Use "jeodezi"

You might consider using the **jeodezi** package in scenarios such as:
- Developing location-based applications that require accurate distance measurements.
- Implementing features that involve mapping and geospatial data.
- Creating applications that need to convert between different coordinate systems.

## Key Features

- **Distance Calculations**: Easily compute distances between geographical points using various algorithms.
- **Coordinate Transformations**: Convert coordinates between different systems, such as from WGS84 to UTM.
- **Geodetic Calculations**: Perform advanced geodetic computations, including azimuth and elevation calculations.

With these features, **jeodezi** is an essential package for any Flutter application that requires geospatial functionalities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "jeodezi" Package

## Installation

To get started with the **jeodezi** package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  jeodezi: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/jeodezi).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow location services if your application requires access to the user's location.

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your location.</string>
```

## Using the Package

Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the **jeodezi** package to calculate the distance between two geographical points.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:jeodezi/jeodezi.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Jeodezi Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Jeodezi Package Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DistanceCalculator(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DistanceCalculator extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DistanceCalculatorState createState() => _DistanceCalculatorState();
}

class _DistanceCalculatorState extends State<DistanceCalculator> {
  double _distance = 0.0;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _calculateDistance();
  }

  void _calculateDistance() {
    // Define two geographical points (latitude and longitude)
    final point1 = LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194); // San Francisco
    final point2 = LatLng(34.0522, -118.2437); // Los Angeles

    // Calculate the distance using the jeodezi package
    _distance = Geodesy().distanceBetween(point1, point2);
    
    // Update the state to reflect the calculated distance
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text(
          'Distance between points:',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        Text(
          '$_distance meters',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// The application starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// Inside RealFlutter, we create a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// The home widget is a Scaffold that contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// The Center widget holds a DistanceCalculator widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// In the DistanceCalculator, we define two geographical points (San Francisco and Los Angeles).
// We use the Geodesy class from the jeodezi package to calculate the distance between these points.
// The calculated distance is displayed in the UI, updating whenever the calculation is performed.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->
```

### Summary of Application Flow

The application begins by running the `RealFlutter` widget, which sets up a basic Flutter app structure. The `DistanceCalculator` widget is responsible for calculating the distance between two predefined geographical points (San Francisco and Los Angeles) using the **jeodezi** package. The distance is computed in the `initState` method and displayed in the UI. The app updates the displayed distance whenever the calculation is performed, providing a clear and interactive experience for the user.
