```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0' // Required for compatibility
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

#### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save downloaded files.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>

```

### Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:file_downloader_flutter/file_downloader_flutter.dart';
```

## Using the Package

### Basic Usage Example
To download a file, you can use the following code snippet:

```dart
void downloadFile(String url, String fileName) async {
  try {
    // Start the download
    var result = await FileDownloader.downloadFile(
      url: url,
      name: fileName,
      onProgress: (double progress) {
        print("Download progress: $progress%");
      },
    );
    print("File downloaded: $result");
  } catch (e) {
    print("Error downloading file: $e");
  }
}
```

This function takes a URL and a file name, starts the download, and prints the progress to the console.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:file_downloader_flutter/file_downloader_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'File Downloader Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('File Downloader'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // URL of the file to download
              String fileUrl = 'https://example.com/sample.pdf';
              // Name of the file to save as
              String fileName = 'sample.pdf';
              // Call the download function
              downloadFile(fileUrl, fileName);
            },
            child: Text('Download File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to download a file
  void downloadFile(String url, String fileName) async {
    try {
      // Start the download
      var result = await FileDownloader.downloadFile(
        url: url,
        name: fileName,
        onProgress: (double progress) {
          // Print the download progress
          print("Download progress: $progress%");
        },
      );
      // Print the result of the download
      print("File downloaded: $result");
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors during the download
      print("Error downloading file: $e");
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled "Download File".
// 2. When the button is pressed, it triggers the downloadFile function.
// 3. The downloadFile function initiates the file download from the specified URL.
// 4. The onProgress callback provides real-time updates on the download progress.
// 5. Once the download is complete, the result is printed to the console.
// 6. If an error occurs during the download, it is caught and printed to the console.
