# Setting Up and Using the `action_slider` Package

In this section, we'll walk through the setup process for integrating the `action_slider` package into your Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Installation

To get started, add the `action_slider` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  action_slider: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

No additional configuration is required for Android. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the `action_slider`

To use the `action_slider`, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:action_slider/action_slider.dart';
```

### Implementing the Slider

Here's a basic implementation of the `action_slider` in a Flutter widget:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Action Slider Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ActionSlider(
          child: Text('Slide to Confirm'),
          onSlide: () {
            // Action to perform when slider is completed
            print('Action confirmed!');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

<-- MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:action_slider/action_slider.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Action Slider Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Action Slider Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ActionSlider.standard(
          child: Text('Slide to Confirm'),
          onSlide: () {
            // Action to perform when slider is completed
            print('Action confirmed!');
          },
          sliderBehavior: SliderBehavior.stretch,
          backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
          foregroundColor: Colors.blue,
          icon: Icons.arrow_forward,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// RealFlutter is the home widget, which is a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// Inside the Center widget, an ActionSlider is used with a standard configuration.
// The ActionSlider has a child Text widget prompting the user to slide to confirm.
// The onSlide callback is triggered when the slider reaches the end, printing a confirmation message.
// The slider's appearance is customized with background and foreground colors, and an icon is set for the slider handle.
```

In this complete example, we have a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `action_slider` package. The application consists of a single screen with an interactive slider. When the user slides the slider to the end, a confirmation message is printed to the console. The slider is styled with custom colors and an icon to enhance the user interface.

This example showcases the ease of integrating the `action_slider` into a Flutter app, providing a smooth and interactive user experience for actions that require confirmation or engagement.
