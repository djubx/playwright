# Flutter OSS Licenses Package

The `flutter_oss_licenses` package is a Flutter plugin that helps developers display the open-source licenses of the packages used in their Flutter applications. This is particularly useful for compliance with open-source licenses, which often require that the licenses be made available to users. 

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_oss_licenses` package in your Flutter applications when:
- You are using multiple open-source libraries and need to comply with their licensing requirements.
- You want to provide transparency to your users about the third-party libraries your application depends on.
- You need a simple way to display license information without manually collecting and formatting it.

## Features

- **Automatic License Collection**: The package automatically collects licenses from all the dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml`.
- **Customizable Display**: You can customize how the licenses are displayed in your application.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

By integrating this package, you can ensure that your application adheres to open-source licensing requirements while providing a better user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_oss_licenses

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_oss_licenses` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_oss_licenses` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_oss_licenses: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file to allow for network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display the licenses.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_oss_licenses/flutter_oss_licenses.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'OSS Licenses Example',
      home: LicensePage(),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays the licenses of the packages used.

# Complete Example of Using flutter_oss_licenses

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_oss_licenses/flutter_oss_licenses.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'OSS Licenses Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: LicensePage(), // This widget displays the licenses
    );
  }
}

// The LicensePage widget automatically collects and displays the licenses
// from all the dependencies in the pubspec.yaml file. It provides a simple
// interface for users to view the licenses of the open-source packages
// used in the application. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget,
// which sets up the MaterialApp and directs to the LicensePage.

```

// The application starts by calling the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The home property of the MaterialApp is set to LicensePage, which is provided by the flutter_oss_licenses package.
// When the app runs, the LicensePage widget automatically collects and displays the licenses of all the dependencies.
// This allows users to easily view the open-source licenses used in the application, ensuring compliance and transparency.
