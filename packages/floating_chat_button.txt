# Tutorial: Setting Up the Floating Chat Button

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **floating_chat_button** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **floating_chat_button** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  floating_chat_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions for internet access if your chat feature requires it:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Floating Chat Button

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the floating chat button.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:floating_chat_button/floating_chat_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Floating Chat Button Example')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Chat App!')),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingChatButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action to perform when the button is pressed
            print('Chat button pressed!');
          },
          icon: Icons.chat,
          backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a floating chat button that prints a message to the console when pressed.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we covered the setup and usage of the **floating_chat_button** package in a Flutter application. We added the package to our dependencies, configured platform-specific settings, and implemented a basic chat button in our app.

# Complete Example of Floating Chat Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:floating_chat_button/floating_chat_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Floating Chat Button Example')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Chat App!')),
        // The floating action button is added here
        floatingActionButton: FloatingChatButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action to perform when the button is pressed
            // This could be navigating to a chat screen or opening a chat dialog
            print('Chat button pressed!');
          },
          icon: Icons.chat, // Icon displayed on the button
          backgroundColor: Colors.blue, // Background color of the button
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with a title and a Center widget displaying a welcome message.
// 4. The FloatingChatButton is added as a floating action button.
// 5. When the FloatingChatButton is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback, which currently prints a message to the console.
// 6. This setup allows for easy integration of chat functionality, where the onPressed callback can be modified to open a chat interface or perform other actions.
