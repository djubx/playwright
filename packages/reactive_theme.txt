# Exploring the `reactive_theme` Flutter Package

The `reactive_theme` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement dynamic theming in their applications. This package allows you to create a responsive and customizable theme that can change based on user preferences or application states. 

## When to Use `reactive_theme`

- **Dynamic Theming**: If your application requires the ability to switch themes (like light and dark mode) based on user preferences or system settings.
- **User Customization**: When you want to allow users to customize the look and feel of your app, such as changing colors or fonts.
- **Responsive Design**: For applications that need to adapt their appearance based on different screen sizes or orientations.

## Key Features

- **Reactive Theme Switching**: Easily switch between themes without needing to rebuild the entire widget tree.
- **Customizable Themes**: Define your own themes with custom colors, fonts, and styles.
- **Integration with Provider**: Works seamlessly with the Provider package for state management.
- **Light and Dark Mode Support**: Built-in support for light and dark themes, making it easy to implement system-wide theme changes.

The `reactive_theme` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance the user experience through dynamic theming capabilities.

# Setting Up and Using the `reactive_theme` Package

## Installation

To get started with the `reactive_theme` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  reactive_theme: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31  // Ensure you are using a compatible SDK version
    ...
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your `ios/Podfile` is set to use a compatible platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure you are using a compatible iOS version
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `reactive_theme` package, you need to wrap your application with the `ReactiveTheme` widget. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reactive_theme/reactive_theme.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ReactiveTheme(
      light: ThemeData.light(),
      dark: ThemeData.dark(),
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Reactive Theme Demo',
        theme: ReactiveTheme.of(context).currentTheme,
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Reactive Theme Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Toggle theme
            ReactiveTheme.of(context).toggleTheme();
          },
          child: Text('Toggle Theme'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we set up a basic Flutter application that allows users to toggle between light and dark themes using a button.

# Complete Example of `reactive_theme`

Here’s a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `reactive_theme` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reactive_theme/reactive_theme.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ReactiveTheme(
      light: ThemeData.light(), // Define light theme
      dark: ThemeData.dark(),   // Define dark theme
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Reactive Theme Demo',
        theme: ReactiveTheme.of(context).currentTheme, // Set current theme
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Reactive Theme Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Toggle between light and dark themes
            ReactiveTheme.of(context).toggleTheme();
          },
          child: Text('Toggle Theme'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter initializes the ReactiveTheme with light and dark themes.
// 3. The MaterialApp uses the current theme from ReactiveTheme.
// 4. HomeScreen is displayed with a button to toggle the theme.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the toggleTheme method is called, switching the theme.
// 6. The UI updates reactively to reflect the new theme without needing a full rebuild.
