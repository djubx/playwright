# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Hover Menu Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **hover_menu** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hover_menu: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions or configurations in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. However, the **hover_menu** package does not require any specific configurations beyond the standard Flutter setup.

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the **hover_menu** package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:hover_menu/hover_menu.dart';
```

You can then create a hover menu by wrapping your target widget with the `HoverMenu` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
HoverMenu(
  menuItems: [
    MenuItem(title: 'Option 1', onTap: () => print('Option 1 tapped')),
    MenuItem(title: 'Option 2', onTap: () => print('Option 2 tapped')),
  ],
  child: Text('Hover over me!'),
);
```

This code snippet creates a hover menu that appears when the user hovers over the text "Hover over me!". Each menu item has an associated action that gets triggered when tapped.

## Conclusion

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the **hover_menu** package in your Flutter application. Experiment with different configurations and styles to create a unique user experience.

# Complete Example of Hover Menu in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hover_menu/hover_menu.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Hover Menu Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Hover Menu Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: HoverMenu(
            // Define the menu items that will appear on hover
            menuItems: [
              MenuItem(
                title: 'Option 1',
                onTap: () {
                  // Action for Option 1
                  print('Option 1 tapped');
                },
              ),
              MenuItem(
                title: 'Option 2',
                onTap: () {
                  // Action for Option 2
                  print('Option 2 tapped');
                },
              ),
              MenuItem(
                title: 'Option 3',
                onTap: () {
                  // Action for Option 3
                  print('Option 3 tapped');
                },
              ),
            ],
            // The child widget that will trigger the hover menu
            child: Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
              color: Colors.blueAccent,
              child: Text(
                'Hover over me!',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Hover Menu Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The HoverMenu widget wraps a Container that displays the text 'Hover over me!'.
// 6. When the user hovers over the Container, the hover menu appears with three options.
// 7. Each menu option has an onTap action that prints a message to the console when tapped.
