Here's a detailed technical blog on the "rename" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Rename Flutter Package

The **rename** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of renaming your Flutter application across various platforms. This package automates the tedious task of updating the app name, package name, and other related configurations, ensuring that your app is correctly identified in both Android and iOS environments.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the rename package in the following scenarios:

- **Rebranding**: When you want to change the name of your app due to a rebranding effort.
- **Package Name Change**: If you need to change the package name for publishing on app stores.
- **Multiple App Variants**: When creating multiple variants of an app (e.g., free vs. paid versions) that require different names and identifiers.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly with both Android and iOS.
- **Automated Configuration**: Automatically updates all necessary files, including `AndroidManifest.xml`, `Info.plist`, and Gradle files.
- **Customizable**: Allows you to specify new names and package identifiers easily.

By using the rename package, developers can save time and reduce the risk of errors that can occur when manually renaming an app.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Rename Package

## Step 1: Adding the Package

To get started, you need to add the rename package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  rename: ^3.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Configuring for Android

For Android, the rename package will automatically update the following files:

- `android/app/build.gradle`
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Configuring for iOS

For iOS, the package will update the `Info.plist` file. Make sure you have the correct permissions and configurations set in your iOS project.

## Step 4: Using the Package

To rename your app, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter pub run rename --appname "NewAppName" --bundleId "com.example.newapp"
```

Replace `"NewAppName"` with your desired app name and `"com.example.newapp"` with your new package identifier.

## Step 5: Verifying Changes

After running the rename command, verify that the changes have been applied correctly:

- For Android, check the `AndroidManifest.xml` and `build.gradle` files.
- For iOS, check the `Info.plist` file.

## Additional Notes

- Always back up your project before running the rename command.
- If you encounter issues, consult the package documentation for troubleshooting tips.

By following these steps, you can easily rename your Flutter application across both Android and iOS platforms.

# Complete Example: Using the Rename Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Real Flutter App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Welcome to Real Flutter'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'This is the Real Flutter App!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Hello!'),
                    content: Text('You have pressed the button.'),
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                        child: Text('Close'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomeScreen, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. HomeScreen contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds a Column.
// 5. The Column displays a welcome message and a button.
// 6. When the button is pressed, an AlertDialog is shown with a message and a close button.
// 7. The user can close the dialog by pressing the 'Close' button, which dismisses the dialog.
```
