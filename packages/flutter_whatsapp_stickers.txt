# Complete Example of Using flutter_whatsapp_stickers

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_whatsapp_stickers/flutter_whatsapp_stickers.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'WhatsApp Stickers Demo',
      home: StickerHome(),
    );
  }
}

class StickerHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StickerHomeState createState() => _StickerHomeState();
}

class _StickerHomeState extends State<StickerHome> {
  // Create a sticker pack
  final StickerPack myStickerPack = StickerPack(
    identifier: "my_sticker_pack",
    name: "My Stickers",
    publisher: "My Company",
    trayImageFile: "tray_image.png", // Image for the sticker pack tray
    stickers: [
      Sticker(imageFile: "sticker1.png", emojis: ["ðŸ˜€"]), // First sticker
      Sticker(imageFile: "sticker2.png", emojis: ["ðŸ˜‚"]), // Second sticker
    ],
  );

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Add the sticker pack to WhatsApp when the app starts
    _addStickerPack();
  }

  // Function to add the sticker pack
  Future<void> _addStickerPack() async {
    final result = await WhatsAppStickers.addStickerPack(myStickerPack);
    if (result) {
      print("Sticker pack added successfully!");
    } else {
      print("Failed to add sticker pack.");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('WhatsApp Stickers Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Sticker pack added to WhatsApp!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. The StickerHome widget is created, which initializes the sticker pack in its state.
// 4. In the initState method, the _addStickerPack function is called to add the sticker pack to WhatsApp.
// 5. The _addStickerPack function uses the WhatsAppStickers.addStickerPack method to add the sticker pack.
// 6. If successful, a message is printed to the console indicating success; otherwise, it indicates failure.
// 7. The UI displays a simple message indicating that the sticker pack has been added.
```
