**Conditioned Flutter Package: A High-Level Overview**
=====================================================

The Conditioned Flutter package is a powerful tool for managing and optimizing the performance of Flutter applications. It provides a simple and intuitive way to conditionally render widgets based on various factors such as screen size, orientation, and platform.

**When to Use This Package**
---------------------------

This package is particularly useful when developing applications that need to adapt to different screen sizes, orientations, and platforms. For example:

*   When creating a responsive UI that needs to adjust its layout based on the screen size and orientation.
*   When developing a cross-platform application that needs to handle platform-specific features and limitations.

**Key Features**
----------------

*   **Conditional Rendering**: Render widgets conditionally based on various factors such as screen size, orientation, and platform.
*   **Responsive UI**: Create responsive UIs that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
*   **Platform-Specific Features**: Handle platform-specific features and limitations with ease.

**Setting Up the Conditioned Flutter Package**
=============================================

To use the Conditioned Flutter package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  conditioned: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:conditioned/conditioned.dart';
```

### Step 3: Use the Package

Use the `Conditioned` widget to conditionally render widgets based on various factors. For example:

```dart
Conditioned(
  child: Text('Hello, World!'),
  conditions: [
    Condition(
      predicate: (context) => MediaQuery.of(context).size.width > 600,
      child: Text('Large screen'),
    ),
    Condition(
      predicate: (context) => MediaQuery.of(context).size.width <= 600,
      child: Text('Small screen'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, the `Conditioned` widget will render the `Text` widget with the text "Large screen" if the screen width is greater than 600 pixels, and the `Text` widget with the text "Small screen" otherwise.

### Platform-Specific Details

The Conditioned Flutter package provides platform-specific features and limitations. For example, you can use the `Conditioned` widget to handle platform-specific features such as screen orientation:

```dart
Conditioned(
  child: Text('Hello, World!'),
  conditions: [
    Condition(
      predicate: (context) => MediaQuery.of(context).orientation == Orientation.portrait,
      child: Text('Portrait orientation'),
    ),
    Condition(
      predicate: (context) => MediaQuery.of(context).orientation == Orientation.landscape,
      child: Text('Landscape orientation'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, the `Conditioned` widget will render the `Text` widget with the text "Portrait orientation" if the screen orientation is portrait, and the `Text` widget with the text "Landscape orientation" otherwise.

### Configurations and Optimizations

The Conditioned Flutter package provides various configurations and optimizations to improve performance. For example, you can use the `Conditioned` widget to cache the results of the conditions:

```dart
Conditioned(
  child: Text('Hello, World!'),
  conditions: [
    Condition(
      predicate: (context) => MediaQuery.of(context).size.width > 600,
      child: Text('Large screen'),
      cache: true,
    ),
    Condition(
      predicate: (context) => MediaQuery.of(context).size.width <= 600,
      child: Text('Small screen'),
      cache: true,
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, the `Conditioned` widget will cache the results of the conditions, which can improve performance by reducing the number of times the conditions are evaluated.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:conditioned/conditioned.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Conditioned Flutter Package Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Conditioned Flutter Package Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Conditioned(
          child: Text('Hello, World!'),
          conditions: [
            Condition(
              predicate: (context) => MediaQuery.of(context).size.width > 600,
              child: Text('Large screen'),
            ),
            Condition(
              predicate: (context) => MediaQuery.of(context).size.width <= 600,
              child: Text('Small screen'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application.
// 2. The application renders the `MyHomePage` widget.
// 3. The `MyHomePage` widget renders the `Conditioned` widget.
// 4. The `Conditioned` widget evaluates the conditions.
// 5. If the screen width is greater than 600 pixels, the `Conditioned` widget renders the `Text` widget with the text "Large screen".
// 6. If the screen width is less than or equal to 600 pixels, the `Conditioned` widget renders the `Text` widget with the text "Small screen".
// 7. The user sees the rendered `Text` widget.

// In summary, the application uses the Conditioned Flutter package to conditionally render widgets based on the screen width.
