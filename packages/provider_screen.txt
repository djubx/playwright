# Overview of the provider_screen Flutter Package

The `provider_screen` package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the management of screen states in Flutter applications. It leverages the Provider package to create a seamless way to handle different screen states, making it easier for developers to manage navigation and state changes within their apps.

## When to Use `provider_screen`

You should consider using `provider_screen` when:
- You have multiple screens in your application that require state management.
- You want to maintain a clean separation of concerns between UI and business logic.
- You need to manage complex navigation flows that depend on the state of your application.

## Key Features
- **State Management**: Integrates with the Provider package to manage state effectively.
- **Screen Management**: Simplifies the process of switching between different screens based on the application's state.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be easily integrated into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.
- **Reactive Updates**: Automatically updates the UI when the state changes, ensuring a responsive user experience.

Overall, `provider_screen` is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to streamline their screen management and state handling processes.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `provider_screen`

## Installation

To get started with `provider_screen`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  provider_screen: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/provider_screen).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter and the `provider_screen` package. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using `provider_screen`

1. **Create a Screen Model**: Define a model that will hold the state of your screens.
2. **Set Up the Provider**: Wrap your application with the `Provider` widget to provide the screen model to the widget tree.
3. **Create Screens**: Define the different screens that will be managed by the `provider_screen`.
4. **Manage Navigation**: Use the provided methods to navigate between screens based on the state.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up and use `provider_screen` in your Flutter application.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';
import 'package:provider_screen/provider_screen.dart';

// Define a simple model to manage screen states
class ScreenModel with ChangeNotifier {
  // Current screen index
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  // Getter for current index
  int get currentIndex => _currentIndex;

  // Method to change the screen
  void changeScreen(int index) {
    _currentIndex = index;
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners to rebuild the UI
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(
    // Wrap the app with ChangeNotifierProvider
    ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => ScreenModel(),
      child: RealFlutter(),
    ),
  );
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Provider Screen Example',
      home: Consumer<ScreenModel>(
        builder: (context, screenModel, child) {
          // Switch between screens based on the current index
          switch (screenModel.currentIndex) {
            case 0:
              return HomeScreen();
            case 1:
              return SecondScreen();
            default:
              return HomeScreen();
          }
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Home Screen Widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Change to the second screen when button is pressed
            Provider.of<ScreenModel>(context, listen: false).changeScreen(1);
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Second Screen Widget
class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Change back to the home screen when button is pressed
            Provider.of<ScreenModel>(context, listen: false).changeScreen(0);
          },
          child: Text('Back to Home Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The app starts with the main function, which initializes the ChangeNotifierProvider with the ScreenModel.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp and uses a Consumer to listen for changes in the ScreenModel.
3. Depending on the current index in the ScreenModel, it displays either the HomeScreen or the SecondScreen.
4. In the HomeScreen, when the button is pressed, it calls the changeScreen method to update the index to 1, switching to the SecondScreen.
5. In the SecondScreen, pressing the button changes the index back to 0, returning to the HomeScreen.
