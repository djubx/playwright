# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Scrolls to Top Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `scrolls_to_top` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scrolls_to_top: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `scrolls_to_top` package, you need to wrap your scrollable widget with the `ScrollsToTop` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scrolls_to_top/scrolls_to_top.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Scroll to Top Example')),
        body: ScrollsToTop(
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: 100,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, the `ScrollsToTop` widget wraps a `ListView.builder`, allowing users to scroll back to the top easily.

# Complete Example of the Scrolls to Top Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scrolls_to_top/scrolls_to_top.dart';

// Main application class
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Scroll to Top Example')),
        body: ScrollsToTop(
          // Wrapping ListView with ScrollsToTop
          child: ListView.builder(
            itemCount: 100, // Number of items in the list
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'), // Displaying item number
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
3. The body contains the ScrollsToTop widget, which wraps a ListView.builder.
4. The ListView.builder generates a list of 100 items, each represented by a ListTile.
5. Users can scroll through the list, and the ScrollsToTop functionality allows them to quickly return to the top of the list.
