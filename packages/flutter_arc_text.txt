# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_arc_text

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_arc_text` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_arc_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement `flutter_arc_text` in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_arc_text/flutter_arc_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Arc Text Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ArcText(
            text: Text(
              'Welcome to Flutter!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30, color: Colors.blue),
            ),
            radius: 100, // Adjust the radius as needed
            position: ArcTextPosition.top, // Position of the text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays an arc of text at the top of the screen. You can customize the text, radius, and position as needed.

# Complete Example of flutter_arc_text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_arc_text/flutter_arc_text.dart';

// Main class of the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Arc Text Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ArcText(
            text: Text(
              'Welcome to Flutter!', // The text to be displayed in arc
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30, color: Colors.blue), // Text style
            ),
            radius: 100, // Radius of the arc
            position: ArcTextPosition.top, // Position of the text on the arc
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the basic structure of the app.
3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which includes an AppBar and a body.
4. The AppBar displays the title "Flutter Arc Text Example".
5. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child widget.
6. The child widget is an ArcText widget, which takes a Text widget as input.
7. The Text widget displays "Welcome to Flutter!" with a specified font size and color.
8. The ArcText widget arranges the text in an arc with a specified radius and position.
9. The application is displayed on the screen, showcasing the arc text effect.
