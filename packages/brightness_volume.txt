// This code creates a simple Flutter app that demonstrates the usage of the `brightness_volume` package.
// The app displays the current screen brightness and volume levels, and allows the user to adjust them using sliders.
// The `BrightnessVolume` class is used to set and get the screen brightness and volume levels, and to monitor changes to these levels.
// The `onBrightnessChanged` and `onVolumeChanged` callbacks are used to update the app's UI when the screen brightness or volume level changes.
// The app also uses the `Slider` widget to allow the user to adjust the screen brightness and volume levels.
// The `Slider` widget's `value` property is used to set the initial value of the slider, and the `onChanged` property is used to update the app's UI when the user adjusts the slider.
// The app's UI is updated using the `setState` method, which is called whenever the user adjusts the slider or the screen brightness or volume level changes.
// This code provides a basic example of how to use the `brightness_volume` package in a Flutter app.
// It demonstrates how to set and get the screen brightness and volume levels, and how to monitor changes to these levels.
// It also shows how to use the `Slider` widget to allow the user to adjust the screen brightness and volume levels.
// This code can be used as a starting point for more complex apps that require control over the screen brightness and volume levels.
