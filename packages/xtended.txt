# Setting Up and Using the Xtended Package

## Installation
To add the xtended package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  xtended: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/xtended).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed, you can start using its features. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use an extension method from the xtended package:

```dart
import 'package:xtended/xtended.dart';

void main() {
  String text = "Hello, Flutter!";
  print(text.capitalize()); // Outputs: Hello, flutter!
}
```

In this example, the `capitalize` method is an extension method that capitalizes the first letter of the string.

### Additional Configuration
For optimal performance, consider using the package's built-in caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data, especially when dealing with network requests or large datasets.

With these steps, you are now ready to leverage the xtended package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of Using Xtended in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:xtended/xtended.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Xtended Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Xtended Package Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            // Using the capitalize extension method from xtended
            "hello, flutter!".capitalize(), // Outputs: Hello, flutter!
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class extends StatelessWidget and builds the main UI.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget sets up the app's title and home screen.
// 4. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual structure.
// 5. An AppBar is created with the title 'Xtended Package Demo'.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget to center its child.
// 7. A Text widget displays a string that is transformed using the capitalize extension method from the xtended package.
// 8. The final output is a capitalized greeting displayed in the center of the screen.
