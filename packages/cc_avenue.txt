# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the cc_avenue Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `cc_avenue` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `cc_avenue` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cc_avenue: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure you have the correct deployment target set in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have configured the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initiate a payment.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cc_avenue/cc_avenue.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('CCAvenue Payment')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Initialize the payment process
              CCAvenue.startPayment(
                merchantId: 'YOUR_MERCHANT_ID',
                orderId: 'ORDER_ID',
                amount: '100.00',
                currency: 'INR',
                redirectUrl: 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URL',
                cancelUrl: 'YOUR_CANCEL_URL',
                // Add any additional parameters as needed
              ).then((result) {
                // Handle the payment result
                if (result['status'] == 'success') {
                  // Payment was successful
                  print('Payment Successful: ${result['message']}');
                } else {
                  // Payment failed
                  print('Payment Failed: ${result['message']}');
                }
              });
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that initiates the payment process when pressed. The `CCAvenue.startPayment` method is called with the necessary parameters, and the result is handled in a callback.

# Complete Example of Using the cc_avenue Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cc_avenue/cc_avenue.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('CCAvenue Payment')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Start the payment process with CCAvenue
              CCAvenue.startPayment(
                merchantId: 'YOUR_MERCHANT_ID', // Your CCAvenue merchant ID
                orderId: 'ORDER_ID', // Unique order ID for the transaction
                amount: '100.00', // Amount to be charged
                currency: 'INR', // Currency type
                redirectUrl: 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URL', // URL to redirect after payment
                cancelUrl: 'YOUR_CANCEL_URL', // URL to redirect if payment is canceled
              ).then((result) {
                // Handle the payment result
                if (result['status'] == 'success') {
                  // Payment was successful
                  print('Payment Successful: ${result['message']}');
                } else {
                  // Payment failed
                  print('Payment Failed: ${result['message']}');
                }
              });
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled "Pay Now".
// 2. When the button is pressed, the CCAvenue payment process is initiated.
// 3. The payment details such as merchant ID, order ID, amount, currency, and redirect URLs are passed to the `startPayment` method.
// 4. The app waits for the payment result.
// 5. If the payment is successful, a success message is printed to the console.
// 6. If the payment fails, a failure message is printed to the console.
