# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_dropdown_plus`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `flutter_dropdown_plus`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_dropdown_plus: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a dropdown using `flutter_dropdown_plus`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_dropdown_plus/flutter_dropdown_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Dropdown Plus Example')),
        body: DropdownExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DropdownExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DropdownExampleState createState() => _DropdownExampleState();
}

class _DropdownExampleState extends State<DropdownExample> {
  List<String> items = ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3', 'Option 4'];
  List<String> selectedItems = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: DropdownPlus<String>(
        items: items,
        onChanged: (value) {
          setState(() {
            selectedItems = value ?? [];
          });
        },
        hint: Text('Select Options'),
        isMultiSelect: true, // Enable multi-select
        selectedItems: selectedItems,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple dropdown that allows users to select multiple options. The selected items are stored in the `selectedItems` list, which updates whenever the user makes a selection.

# Complete Example: Flutter Dropdown Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_dropdown_plus/flutter_dropdown_plus.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Dropdown Plus Example')),
        body: DropdownExample(),
      );
    });
  }
}

// Stateful widget to demonstrate the dropdown functionality
class DropdownExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DropdownExampleState createState() => _DropdownExampleState();
}

// State class for DropdownExample
class _DropdownExampleState extends State<DropdownExample> {
  // List of items to display in the dropdown
  List<String> items = ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3', 'Option 4'];
  // List to hold selected items
  List<String> selectedItems = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: DropdownPlus<String>(
        items: items, // Pass the list of items
        onChanged: (value) {
          // Update the selected items when the dropdown value changes
          setState(() {
            selectedItems = value ?? []; // Update selected items
          });
        },
        hint: Text('Select Options'), // Hint text for the dropdown
        isMultiSelect: true, // Enable multi-select functionality
        selectedItems: selectedItems, // Pass the currently selected items
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the DropdownExample widget.
// 3. DropdownExample is a StatefulWidget that maintains a list of items and selected items.
// 4. When the dropdown value changes, the onChanged callback updates the selectedItems list.
// 5. The dropdown allows users to select multiple options, and the selected items are displayed in the dropdown.
```
