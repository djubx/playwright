# GText Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To use the GText package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  gtext: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package. After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter and GText. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the GText package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:gtext/gtext.dart';
```

2. Use the `GText` widget in your widget tree:

```dart
GText(
  'Hello, Flutter!',
  styles: [
    GTextStyle(
      color: Colors.blue,
      fontSize: 24,
      fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
    ),
    GTextStyle(
      text: ' Welcome to GText.',
      color: Colors.red,
      fontSize: 20,
    ),
  ],
)
```

This example demonstrates how to create a text widget with multiple styles applied to different segments of the text. 

By following these steps, you can easily integrate the GText package into your Flutter application and start utilizing its powerful text handling capabilities.

# Complete Example of GText in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gtext/gtext.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'GText Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('GText Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: GText(
            'Hello, Flutter!',
            styles: [
              // First style for the main greeting
              GTextStyle(
                color: Colors.blue,
                fontSize: 24,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              ),
              // Second style for the welcome message
              GTextStyle(
                text: ' Welcome to GText.',
                color: Colors.red,
                fontSize: 20,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code defines a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the GText package.
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'GText Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a GText widget that displays a greeting message.
// 5. The GText widget uses two GTextStyle objects to apply different styles to different parts of the text.
// 6. The first part of the text is styled with a blue color, larger font size, and bold weight.
// 7. The second part of the text is styled with a red color and a slightly smaller font size.
// This example showcases how to create rich text layouts using the GText package in a Flutter application.
