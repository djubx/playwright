# Complete Example of Onboarding Intro Screen

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:onboarding_intro_screen/onboarding_intro_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Onboarding Intro Screen Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: OnboardingScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class OnboardingScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return OnboardingIntroScreen(
      pages: [
        // First onboarding page
        OnboardingPage(
          title: 'Welcome to RealFlutter',
          description: 'Discover amazing features and functionalities.',
          image: 'assets/images/welcome.png', // Add your image path
        ),
        // Second onboarding page
        OnboardingPage(
          title: 'Stay Connected',
          description: 'Connect with your friends and family easily.',
          image: 'assets/images/connect.png', // Add your image path
        ),
        // Third onboarding page
        OnboardingPage(
          title: 'Get Started',
          description: 'Let\'s get started with your journey!',
          image: 'assets/images/get_started.png', // Add your image path
        ),
      ],
      onSkip: () {
        // Action when the skip button is pressed
        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
          MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => HomeScreen()),
        );
      },
      onDone: () {
        // Action when the done button is pressed
        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
          MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => HomeScreen()),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The OnboardingScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 4. The OnboardingIntroScreen widget is initialized with multiple OnboardingPage widgets.
// 5. Each OnboardingPage contains a title, description, and image.
// 6. Users can navigate through the onboarding pages using the built-in controls.
// 7. The onSkip and onDone callbacks navigate to the HomeScreen when triggered.
// 8. The HomeScreen displays a simple welcome message after onboarding is complete.
