# Flutter Verification Code Package

The `flutter_verification_code` package is a Flutter plugin designed to facilitate the input of verification codes, commonly used in scenarios such as two-factor authentication (2FA) or account verification processes. This package provides a user-friendly interface for entering codes, enhancing the user experience by allowing for easy input and validation.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_verification_code` package in the following scenarios:

- **Two-Factor Authentication**: When implementing 2FA in your application, this package can streamline the process of entering verification codes sent via SMS or email.
- **Account Verification**: If your app requires users to verify their accounts through a code sent to their registered email or phone number, this package simplifies the input process.
- **Secure Transactions**: For applications that involve sensitive transactions, using a verification code can add an extra layer of security.

## Features

- **Customizable UI**: The package allows for customization of the input fields, enabling you to match the design with your application's theme.
- **Automatic Focus Management**: It automatically shifts focus to the next input field after a digit is entered, improving the user experience.
- **Validation**: Built-in validation ensures that the input is numeric and adheres to the expected length.
- **Error Handling**: Provides mechanisms to handle errors gracefully, such as incorrect code entries.

Overall, the `flutter_verification_code` package is a powerful tool for developers looking to implement secure and user-friendly verification processes in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_verification_code

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_verification_code` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_verification_code` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_verification_code: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include permissions for network access if you are fetching verification codes from a server. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the verification code input.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_verification_code/flutter_verification_code.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the verification code input:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _code = "";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Verification Code")),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            VerificationCode(
              length: 6,
              onCompleted: (String value) {
                setState(() {
                  _code = value; // Store the entered code
                });
              },
              onEditing: (bool value) {
                // Handle editing state
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text("Entered Code: $_code"),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple verification code input field and displays the entered code below it.

# Complete Example of flutter_verification_code

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_verification_code/flutter_verification_code.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Verification Code Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _code = ""; // Variable to store the entered verification code

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Verification Code")),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // VerificationCode widget for inputting the code
            VerificationCode(
              length: 6, // Length of the verification code
              onCompleted: (String value) {
                setState(() {
                  _code = value; // Store the entered code
                });
              },
              onEditing: (bool value) {
                // Handle editing state if needed
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between the input and text
            Text("Entered Code: $_code"), // Display the entered code
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the verification code input.
// 4. Inside the build method, a VerificationCode widget is created, allowing the user to input a 6-digit code.
// 5. When the user completes the input, the onCompleted callback is triggered, updating the _code variable.
// 6. The entered code is displayed below the input field, providing immediate feedback to the user.
