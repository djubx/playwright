# Circular Clip Route Flutter Package

The `circular_clip_route` package is a Flutter library that provides a way to create circular clipping transitions between screens. This package is particularly useful for applications that require smooth and visually appealing transitions, enhancing the user experience. 

## When to Use

You might consider using the `circular_clip_route` package in scenarios such as:
- **Custom Navigation**: When you want to implement unique navigation transitions that stand out from the default Flutter transitions.
- **Themed Applications**: In apps where the design language emphasizes circular shapes or animations, this package can help maintain consistency.
- **Interactive UI**: For applications that require engaging and interactive user interfaces, circular transitions can add a layer of dynamism.

## Features
- **Customizable Radius**: You can specify the radius of the circular clip, allowing for various visual effects.
- **Smooth Animations**: The package provides smooth animations that enhance the overall user experience.
- **Easy Integration**: It can be easily integrated into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

Overall, the `circular_clip_route` package is a powerful tool for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with custom transitions.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Circular Clip Route

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `circular_clip_route` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  circular_clip_route: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `circular_clip_route`, you can create a new route that utilizes the circular clipping effect. Below is a simple example of how to implement it in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:circular_clip_route/circular_clip_route.dart';
```

2. Create a new route using `CircularClipRoute`:

```dart
Navigator.of(context).push(
  CircularClipRoute(
    page: SecondPage(),
    radius: 100.0, // Specify the radius for the circular clip
  ),
);
```

3. Ensure that your pages are set up to handle the transition.

With these steps, you can easily implement circular transitions in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Circular Clip Route

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:circular_clip_route/circular_clip_route.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Circular Clip Route Example',
      home: FirstPage(),
    );
  }
}

class FirstPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('First Page')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the second page with a circular clip transition
            Navigator.of(context).push(
              CircularClipRoute(
                page: SecondPage(),
                radius: 100.0, // Set the radius for the circular clip
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Page'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Page')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate back to the first page with a circular clip transition
            Navigator.of(context).pop();
          },
          child: Text('Back to First Page'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home page is set to FirstPage, which contains a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, it triggers a navigation to SecondPage using CircularClipRoute.
// 4. The transition is animated with a circular clip effect, defined by the specified radius.
// 5. In SecondPage, there is a button to navigate back to FirstPage, which also uses the circular clip transition.
// 6. The app demonstrates a smooth and visually appealing navigation experience using the circular clip route.
