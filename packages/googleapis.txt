# Googleapis Flutter Package

The `googleapis` Flutter package provides a convenient way to access various Google APIs directly from your Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to integrate Google services such as Google Drive, Google Sheets, Google Calendar, and more into their mobile applications. 

## When to Use This Package
You should consider using the `googleapis` package when:
- You need to access Google services programmatically.
- You want to integrate features like file storage, calendar events, or data manipulation from Google Sheets into your Flutter app.
- You are building applications that require user authentication with Google accounts.

## Features
- **Wide Range of APIs**: Access to multiple Google services.
- **OAuth 2.0 Support**: Secure authentication for users.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking calls to Google services.
- **Strongly Typed Models**: Automatically generated models for API responses.

This package simplifies the process of interacting with Google APIs, making it easier to build feature-rich applications that leverage Google's powerful services.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Googleapis Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To use the `googleapis` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  googleapis: ^9.0.0
  googleapis_auth: ^1.0.0
```

## Step 2: Configure OAuth 2.0
To access Google APIs, you need to set up OAuth 2.0 credentials in the Google Cloud Console.

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
4. Click on "Create Credentials" and select "OAuth client ID".
5. Configure the consent screen and set the application type to "Web application".
6. Add your redirect URIs (for mobile apps, you can use `http://localhost`).
7. Save your credentials and note the client ID and client secret.

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add internet permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package and configured OAuth 2.0, you can start using it in your Flutter application. 

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to authenticate and make a request to a Google API.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:googleapis_auth/auth_io.dart';
import 'package:googleapis/sheets/v4.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Google APIs Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Google APIs Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Step 1: Define the client ID and secret
              var clientId = ClientId('YOUR_CLIENT_ID', 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET');
              // Step 2: Define the scopes for the APIs you want to access
              var scopes = [SheetsApi.spreadsheetsScope];

              // Step 3: Authenticate the user
              var client = await clientViaUserConsent(clientId, scopes, (url) {
                // Step 4: Open the URL in the browser for user consent
                print('Please go to the following URL and grant access:');
                print('  => $url');
              });

              // Step 5: Create an instance of the Sheets API
              var sheetsApi = SheetsApi(client);

              // Step 6: Make a request to the Sheets API
              var spreadsheetId = 'YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID';
              var range = 'Sheet1!A1:D10';
              var response = await sheetsApi.spreadsheets.values.get(spreadsheetId, range);

              // Step 7: Print the values retrieved from the spreadsheet
              print('Values: ${response.values}');
            },
            child: Text('Fetch Google Sheets Data'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button to fetch data from Google Sheets.
// 2. When the button is pressed, it initiates the OAuth 2.0 authentication process.
// 3. The user is prompted to visit a URL to grant access to their Google account.
// 4. After granting access, the app creates an instance of the Sheets API.
// 5. It then makes a request to retrieve data from a specified range in a Google Sheet.
// 6. Finally, it prints the retrieved values to the console.
```
