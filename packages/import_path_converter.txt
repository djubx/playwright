# Overview of the `import_path_converter` Flutter Package

The `import_path_converter` package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the management of import paths in Flutter projects. It allows developers to convert relative import paths into absolute paths, making code organization cleaner and more maintainable. This package is particularly useful in larger projects where managing import paths can become cumbersome.

## When to Use This Package
- **Large Projects**: In projects with many files and directories, relative paths can become complex and hard to manage.
- **Code Refactoring**: When moving files around, this package helps in automatically updating import paths.
- **Team Collaboration**: Ensures that all team members are using consistent import paths, reducing merge conflicts.

## Key Features
- **Automatic Path Conversion**: Converts relative paths to absolute paths seamlessly.
- **Customizable Path Prefixes**: Allows developers to define custom prefixes for their import paths.
- **Integration with IDEs**: Works well with popular IDEs, enhancing the development experience.

Overall, `import_path_converter` enhances code readability and maintainability, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit.

# Setting Up and Using `import_path_converter`

## Installation
To add the `import_path_converter` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  import_path_converter: ^latest_version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly.

### iOS
Similar to Android, no additional configurations are needed for iOS. The package works out of the box.

## Basic Usage
To use the `import_path_converter`, you need to import it into your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:import_path_converter/import_path_converter.dart';
```

You can then use the `ImportPathConverter` class to convert paths as needed. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void main() {
  final converter = ImportPathConverter();
  String absolutePath = converter.convert('lib/src/my_file.dart');
  print(absolutePath); // Outputs: /your_project/lib/src/my_file.dart
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create an instance of `ImportPathConverter` and convert a relative path to an absolute path.

# Complete Example of Using `import_path_converter`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:import_path_converter/import_path_converter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an instance of ImportPathConverter
    final converter = ImportPathConverter();

    // Convert a relative path to an absolute path
    String relativePath = 'lib/src/my_file.dart';
    String absolutePath = converter.convert(relativePath);

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Import Path Converter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Import Path Converter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Absolute Path: $absolutePath'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, an instance of ImportPathConverter is created.
// 4. A relative path is defined, which is then converted to an absolute path using the converter instance.
// 5. The MaterialApp widget is created with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 6. The AppBar displays the title, and the body contains a Center widget that shows the absolute path on the screen.
