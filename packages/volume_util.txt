// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and the `RealFlutter` widget is displayed.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget gets the current volume level using the `VolumeUtil.getCurrentVolume()` method.
// 3. The current volume level is displayed as a percentage.
// 4. The user can update the volume level using the slider.
// 5. When the user updates the volume level, the `VolumeUtil.setVolume()` method is called to set the new volume level.
// 6. The new volume level is displayed as a percentage.
// 7. The user can mute the volume by pressing the "Mute" button.
// 8. When the user presses the "Mute" button, the `VolumeUtil.setVolume()` method is called to set the volume level to 0.
