# Tutorial: Setting Up Snapkit in Your Flutter Application

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started with Snapkit, you need to add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  snapkit: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the Snapkit package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application>
        <!-- Add this metadata -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.snapkit.sdk.appId"
            android:value="YOUR_SNAP_APP_ID" />
    </application>

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
</manifest>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `android/build.gradle` file has the required Snap dependencies.

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.0.0'
        // Add Snap dependencies
        classpath 'com.snapchat.sdk:snapkit:latest_version'
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos and videos.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save photos and videos.</string>
<key>SnapKitAppId</key>
<string>YOUR_SNAP_APP_ID</string>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the Snapkit pod included in your `Podfile`.

```ruby
pod 'SnapKit', '~> latest_version'
```

## Step 3: Using Snapkit in Your Application

Now that you have set up the Snapkit package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and use Snapkit features.

# Complete Example of Snapkit in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:snapkit/snapkit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Snapkit Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: SnapHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class SnapHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SnapHomePageState createState() => _SnapHomePageState();
}

class _SnapHomePageState extends State<SnapHomePage> {
  // Initialize Snapkit
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    SnapKit.initialize();
  }

  // Function to open Snap camera
  void _openSnapCamera() async {
    try {
      // Open the Snap camera
      final result = await SnapKit.openCamera();
      if (result != null) {
        // Handle the captured image or video
        print('Captured media: $result');
      }
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error opening Snap camera: $e');
    }
  }

  // Function to share to Snap story
  void _shareToSnapStory() async {
    try {
      // Share content to Snap story
      await SnapKit.shareToStory('Check out my new photo!');
      print('Shared to Snap story successfully!');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error sharing to Snap story: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Snapkit Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _openSnapCamera,
              child: Text('Open Snap Camera'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _shareToSnapStory,
              child: Text('Share to Snap Story'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The SnapHomePage widget is created, which initializes Snapkit in its initState method.
// 4. The UI consists of two buttons: one to open the Snap camera and another to share to Snap story.
// 5. When the "Open Snap Camera" button is pressed, the _openSnapCamera function is called, which opens the Snap camera.
// 6. If a media is captured, it is printed to the console.
// 7. When the "Share to Snap Story" button is pressed, the _shareToSnapStory function is called, which shares a message to the Snap story.
// 8. Any errors during these processes are caught and printed to the console.
```
