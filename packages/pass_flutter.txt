# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Pass Flutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **pass_flutter** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pass_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### For iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for accessing the user's wallet:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save passes.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to scan QR codes.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a pass:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pass_flutter/pass_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pass Flutter Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create a new pass
              Pass pass = Pass(
                passType: PassType.event,
                primaryFields: [
                  PassField(key: 'event', label: 'Event', value: 'Flutter Conference'),
                ],
              );

              // Add the pass to the wallet
              PassFlutter.addPass(pass);
            },
            child: Text('Add Pass to Wallet'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that adds a pass to the user's wallet when pressed.

# Complete Example of Pass Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pass_flutter/pass_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pass Flutter Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create a new pass
              Pass pass = Pass(
                passType: PassType.event, // Specify the type of pass
                primaryFields: [
                  PassField(key: 'event', label: 'Event', value: 'Flutter Conference'), // Main event details
                ],
                secondaryFields: [
                  PassField(key: 'date', label: 'Date', value: '2024-09-12'), // Additional information
                ],
                backFields: [
                  PassField(key: 'location', label: 'Location', value: 'Online'), // More details on the back
                ],
              );

              // Add the pass to the wallet
              PassFlutter.addPass(pass).then((result) {
                // Show a confirmation message
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Pass added to wallet!')),
                );
              }).catchError((error) {
                // Handle any errors
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Failed to add pass: $error')),
                );
              });
            },
            child: Text('Add Pass to Wallet'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a new Pass object is created with event details, including primary, secondary, and back fields.
// 5. The pass is then added to the user's wallet using PassFlutter.addPass().
// 6. If the pass is added successfully, a confirmation message is displayed using a SnackBar.
// 7. If there is an error, an error message is shown instead.
```
