# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using TextField Shadow

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `textfield_shadow` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  textfield_shadow: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:textfield_shadow/textfield_shadow.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using TextFieldShadow

You can now use the `TextFieldShadow` widget in your application. Below is an example of how to implement it in a simple Flutter app.

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
  
  ```gradle
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

## Step 5: Customizing the TextFieldShadow

You can customize the shadow properties as follows:

```dart
TextFieldShadow(
  shadowColor: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5),
  shadowBlurRadius: 10.0,
  shadowOffset: Offset(5.0, 5.0),
  child: TextField(
    decoration: InputDecoration(
      hintText: 'Enter your text here',
      border: OutlineInputBorder(),
    ),
  ),
);
```

This customization allows you to create a text field that fits seamlessly into your app's design while providing a visually appealing shadow effect.

# Complete Example of Using TextField Shadow

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:textfield_shadow/textfield_shadow.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'TextField Shadow Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('TextField Shadow Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Using TextFieldShadow to create a shadow effect on the text field
              TextFieldShadow(
                shadowColor: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5), // Set shadow color
                shadowBlurRadius: 10.0, // Set blur radius for the shadow
                shadowOffset: Offset(5.0, 5.0), // Set offset for the shadow
                child: TextField(
                  decoration: InputDecoration(
                    hintText: 'Enter your text here', // Placeholder text
                    border: OutlineInputBorder(), // Border style
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between fields
              TextFieldShadow(
                shadowColor: Colors.blue.withOpacity(0.5), // Different shadow color
                shadowBlurRadius: 15.0, // Different blur radius
                shadowOffset: Offset(3.0, 3.0), // Different offset
                child: TextField(
                  decoration: InputDecoration(
                    hintText: 'Another text field', // Another placeholder
                    border: OutlineInputBorder(), // Border style
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body with padding.
// 4. Inside the body, a Column widget is used to stack the text fields vertically.
// 5. Each TextFieldShadow widget wraps a TextField, providing a shadow effect.
// 6. The first TextFieldShadow has a black shadow, while the second has a blue shadow.
// 7. The TextFields have placeholder text and an outline border for better visibility.
