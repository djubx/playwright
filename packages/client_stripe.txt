# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Client Stripe

## Installation
To get started with the `client_stripe` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  client_stripe: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/client_stripe).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed to avoid compatibility issues.

## Using the Package
Once you have installed and configured the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate a payment.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:client_stripe/client_stripe.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stripe Payment Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize Stripe with your publishable key
              await ClientStripe.init('your_publishable_key');

              // Create a payment method
              final paymentMethod = await ClientStripe.createPaymentMethod(
                PaymentMethodParams.card(),
              );

              // Process the payment
              final paymentIntent = await ClientStripe.confirmPayment(
                paymentMethod.id,
                'your_payment_intent_client_secret',
              );

              // Handle the payment result
              if (paymentIntent.status == 'succeeded') {
                // Payment was successful
                print('Payment successful!');
              } else {
                // Payment failed
                print('Payment failed: ${paymentIntent.status}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),

  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Client Stripe Integration

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:client_stripe/client_stripe.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stripe Payment Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize Stripe with your publishable key
              await ClientStripe.init('your_publishable_key');

              // Create a payment method using card details
              final paymentMethod = await ClientStripe.createPaymentMethod(
                PaymentMethodParams.card(),
              );

              // Confirm the payment using the payment method and client secret
              final paymentIntent = await ClientStripe.confirmPayment(
                paymentMethod.id,
                'your_payment_intent_client_secret',
              );

              // Check the payment status
              if (paymentIntent.status == 'succeeded') {
                // Payment was successful
                print('Payment successful!');
              } else {
                // Payment failed
                print('Payment failed: ${paymentIntent.status}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app initializes the Stripe client with a publishable key.
// 2. When the user taps the "Pay Now" button, it triggers the payment process.
// 3. A payment method is created using the card details provided by the user.
// 4. The payment is confirmed using the payment method ID and the client secret.
// 5. The app checks the payment status and prints the result to the console.
