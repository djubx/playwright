# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Easy Downloader

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **easy_downloader** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_downloader: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_downloader).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. If you are targeting Android 10 (API level 29) or higher, you may need to add the following attribute to your `AndroidManifest.xml` to allow access to external storage:

```xml
<application
    android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"
    ... >
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save downloaded files.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio downloads.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to use the **easy_downloader** package to download a file.

# Complete Example: Using Easy Downloader

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_downloader/easy_downloader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Downloader Example',
      home: DownloadPage(),
    );
  }
}

class DownloadPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DownloadPageState createState() => _DownloadPageState();
}

class _DownloadPageState extends State<DownloadPage> {
  String downloadStatus = "Download Status: Not Started";

  // Function to start the download
  void startDownload() async {
    // URL of the file to download
    String url = "https://example.com/samplefile.pdf";
    
    // Start the download and get the download ID
    int downloadId = await EasyDownloader.download(
      url: url,
      fileName: "samplefile.pdf",
      onProgress: (progress) {
        // Update the download status with progress
        setState(() {
          downloadStatus = "Download Status: $progress%";
        });
      },
      onCompleted: () {
        // Update the status when download is complete
        setState(() {
          downloadStatus = "Download Status: Completed";
        });
      },
      onError: (error) {
        // Handle any errors during the download
        setState(() {
          downloadStatus = "Download Status: Error - $error";
        });
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Easy Downloader Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(downloadStatus),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: startDownload,
              child: Text('Start Download'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (DownloadPage).
// 3. The DownloadPage widget maintains the download status in its state.
// 4. When the user presses the "Start Download" button, the startDownload function is called.
// 5. The startDownload function initiates the download using EasyDownloader.download().
// 6. The download progress is tracked and updated in the UI using setState().
// 7. Once the download is complete or if an error occurs, the status is updated accordingly.
```
