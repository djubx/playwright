# Tutorial: Setting Up Slider Captcha

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **slider_captcha** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **slider_captcha** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  slider_captcha: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to allow for network requests if your CAPTCHA service requires it:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Slider Captcha

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the slider CAPTCHA.

# Complete Example of Slider Captcha

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:slider_captcha/slider_captcha.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Slider Captcha Example',
      home: CaptchaDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class CaptchaDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CaptchaDemoState createState() => _CaptchaDemoState();
}

class _CaptchaDemoState extends State<CaptchaDemo> {
  bool _isVerified = false; // State to track if the user is verified

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Slider Captcha Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the slider captcha
            SliderCaptcha(
              onVerify: () {
                setState(() {
                  _isVerified = true; // Update state on successful verification
                });
              },
              onFail: () {
                // Handle failure case
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Verification failed! Try again.')),
                );
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display verification status
            Text(
              _isVerified ? 'Verified!' : 'Please verify to continue.',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and home widget (CaptchaDemo).
// 3. CaptchaDemo is a stateful widget that manages the verification state.
// 4. The SliderCaptcha widget is displayed, which takes two callbacks: onVerify and onFail.
// 5. When the user successfully slides the captcha, onVerify is called, updating the _isVerified state.
// 6. If verification fails, a SnackBar message is shown to the user.
// 7. The verification status is displayed below the slider, indicating whether the user has been verified or not.
```
