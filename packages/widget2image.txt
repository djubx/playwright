# Widget2Image Flutter Package

The `widget2image` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows you to capture a widget as an image. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where you want to generate images from dynamic content, such as creating custom shareable graphics, saving user-generated content, or even generating previews of widgets.

## When to Use `widget2image`
- **Creating Shareable Content**: If your app allows users to create content that they might want to share, capturing that content as an image can enhance user experience.
- **Dynamic Previews**: For applications that require previews of widgets (like a design tool), this package can render the widget as an image.
- **Custom Graphics**: When you need to generate images programmatically based on user input or app state.

## Features
- **Capture Widgets**: Convert any Flutter widget into an image.
- **Customizable Output**: Control the size and quality of the generated image.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.

Overall, `widget2image` is a versatile package that can enhance the functionality of your Flutter applications by enabling image generation from widgets.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Widget2Image

## Installation
To use the `widget2image` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  widget2image: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` if you plan to save images to the user's photo library. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save images to your photo library.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use `widget2image`, you will typically wrap the widget you want to capture with the `Widget2Image` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget2image/widget2image.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Widget to Image Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Widget2Image(
          controller: Widget2ImageController(),
          child: Container(
            color: Colors.blue,
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
            child: Text(
              'Hello, Widget2Image!',
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app that captures a blue container with text. The `Widget2ImageController` is used to control the capturing process.

# Complete Example of Widget2Image

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget2image/widget2image.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create a controller to manage the widget capture
  final Widget2ImageController _controller = Widget2ImageController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Widget to Image Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Wrap the widget you want to capture with Widget2Image
              Widget2Image(
                controller: _controller,
                child: Container(
                  color: Colors.blue,
                  padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
                  child: Text(
                    'Hello, Widget2Image!',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  // Capture the widget as an image
                  final image = await _controller.capture();
                  // Do something with the captured image, like saving or sharing
                  // For demonstration, we will just show a snackbar
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Image captured!')),
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Capture Image'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. Inside RealFlutter, we create a Widget2ImageController to manage the image capture.
// 3. The Widget2Image widget wraps a Container that displays a message.
// 4. An ElevatedButton is provided to trigger the image capture.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the capture method of the controller is called.
// 6. A snackbar is displayed to inform the user that the image has been captured.
// 7. The captured image can be saved or shared as needed, but in this example, we only show a snackbar.
