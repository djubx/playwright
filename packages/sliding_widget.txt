# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Sliding Widget Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **sliding_widget** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sliding_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:sliding_widget/sliding_widget.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Sliding Widget

You can now use the `SlidingWidget` in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
SlidingWidget(
  items: [
    Container(color: Colors.red, child: Center(child: Text('Slide 1'))),
    Container(color: Colors.green, child: Center(child: Text('Slide 2'))),
    Container(color: Colors.blue, child: Center(child: Text('Slide 3'))),
  ],
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
  curve: Curves.easeInOut,
)
```

This code snippet creates a sliding widget with three colored slides. You can customize the duration and animation curve as needed.

# Complete Example of Sliding Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sliding_widget/sliding_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sliding Widget Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Sliding Widget Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SlidingWidget(
            items: [
              // Slide 1: Red Container
              Container(
                color: Colors.red,
                child: Center(child: Text('Slide 1', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white))),
              ),
              // Slide 2: Green Container
              Container(
                color: Colors.green,
                child: Center(child: Text('Slide 2', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white))),
              ),
              // Slide 3: Blue Container
              Container(
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Center(child: Text('Slide 3', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white))),
              ),
            ],
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300), // Duration of the sliding animation
            curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Animation curve for the sliding effect
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, the SlidingWidget is instantiated with three slides.
// 5. Each slide is a Container with a different background color and centered text.
// 6. The SlidingWidget handles the sliding animations, allowing users to swipe between slides smoothly.
// 7. The duration and curve properties control the animation's speed and style, enhancing the user experience.
```
