# Overview of the ipfs_client_flutter Package

The `ipfs_client_flutter` package is a Flutter library that provides a client for interacting with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS is a distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. This package allows Flutter developers to easily integrate IPFS functionalities into their applications, enabling features such as file uploads, downloads, and retrieval of content from the IPFS network.

## When to Use This Package
- **Decentralized Applications (dApps)**: If you're building a dApp that requires decentralized storage, `ipfs_client_flutter` is an excellent choice.
- **File Sharing Applications**: For apps that need to share files securely and efficiently, leveraging IPFS can enhance user experience.
- **Content Distribution**: If your application involves distributing large files or media, IPFS can help reduce server load and improve access speed.

## Key Features
- **File Uploads**: Easily upload files to the IPFS network.
- **File Retrieval**: Fetch files from IPFS using their unique content identifiers (CIDs).
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilizes Dart's async/await for non-blocking operations, improving app performance.

# Setting Up and Using ipfs_client_flutter

## Installation
To add the `ipfs_client_flutter` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ipfs_client_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ipfs_client_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you need to create an instance of the `IpfsClient` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to upload and retrieve a file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ipfs_client_flutter/ipfs_client_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final IpfsClient _ipfsClient = IpfsClient();

  // Method to upload a file
  Future<void> uploadFile(String filePath) async {
    final result = await _ipfsClient.addFile(filePath);
    print('File uploaded with CID: ${result.cid}');
  }

  // Method to retrieve a file
  Future<void> retrieveFile(String cid) async {
    final file = await _ipfsClient.getFile(cid);
    print('File retrieved: ${file.path}');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('IPFS Client Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => uploadFile('path/to/your/file.txt'),
              child: Text('Upload File'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => retrieveFile('your_file_cid'),
              child: Text('Retrieve File'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using ipfs_client_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ipfs_client_flutter/ipfs_client_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final IpfsClient _ipfsClient = IpfsClient(); // Create an instance of IpfsClient

  // Method to upload a file
  Future<void> uploadFile(String filePath) async {
    // Upload the file to IPFS
    final result = await _ipfsClient.addFile(filePath);
    // Print the CID of the uploaded file
    print('File uploaded with CID: ${result.cid}');
  }

  // Method to retrieve a file
  Future<void> retrieveFile(String cid) async {
    // Retrieve the file from IPFS using its CID
    final file = await _ipfsClient.getFile(cid);
    // Print the path of the retrieved file
    print('File retrieved: ${file.path}');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('IPFS Client Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => uploadFile('path/to/your/file.txt'), // Call uploadFile method
              child: Text('Upload File'), // Button to upload a file
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => retrieveFile('your_file_cid'), // Call retrieveFile method
              child: Text('Retrieve File'), // Button to retrieve a file
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. An instance of IpfsClient is created to interact with the IPFS network.
// 3. The uploadFile method is called when the user presses the "Upload File" button.
//    - This method uploads a file to IPFS and prints the CID.
// 4. The retrieveFile method is called when the user presses the "Retrieve File" button.
//    - This method retrieves a file from IPFS using its CID and prints the file path.
// 5. The UI consists of two buttons for uploading and retrieving files, providing a simple interface for IPFS operations.
