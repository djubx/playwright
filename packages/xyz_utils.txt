# Setting Up and Using the xyz_utils Package

## Installation

To add `xyz_utils` to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  xyz_utils: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set appropriately in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is compatible with the package. You can set this in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `xyz_utils` package, import it into your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:xyz_utils/xyz_utils.dart';
```

You can now access its features. For example, to format a date:

```dart
String formattedDate = DateUtils.formatDate(DateTime.now());
```

This will give you a string representation of the current date in a predefined format.

# Complete Example of Using xyz_utils

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:xyz_utils/xyz_utils.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'xyz_utils Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('xyz_utils Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying formatted date
              Text(
                'Current Date: ${DateUtils.formatDate(DateTime.now())}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Displaying manipulated string
              Text(
                'Uppercase String: ${StringUtils.toUpperCase("hello world")}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Performing a mathematical operation
              Text(
                'Sum of 5 and 10: ${MathUtils.add(5, 10)}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange multiple Text widgets vertically.
// 5. The first Text widget displays the current date formatted using DateUtils.
// 6. The second Text widget shows a string converted to uppercase using StringUtils.
// 7. The third Text widget calculates the sum of two numbers using MathUtils and displays the result.
