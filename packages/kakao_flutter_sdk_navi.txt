# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using kakao_flutter_sdk_navi

## Installation

To get started with the `kakao_flutter_sdk_navi` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  kakao_flutter_sdk_navi: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/kakao_flutter_sdk_navi).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Add Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

2. **Kakao App Key**: You need to register your application on the [Kakao Developer site](https://developers.kakao.com/) and obtain an app key. Add the key to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.kakao.sdk.AppKey"
    android:value="YOUR_APP_KEY"/>
```

### iOS
1. **Add Permissions**: Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide navigation services.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide navigation services.</string>
```

2. **Kakao App Key**: Similar to Android, register your app on the Kakao Developer site and add the app key in your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>KAKAO_APP_KEY</key>
<string>YOUR_APP_KEY</string>
```

## Using the Package

Once you have completed the installation and configuration, you can start using the package in your Flutter application. 

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate navigation:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kakao_flutter_sdk_navi/kakao_flutter_sdk_navi.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Kakao Navigation Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize Kakao SDK
              await KakaoContext.init(appKey: 'YOUR_APP_KEY');

              // Set the destination coordinates
              final destination = LatLng(37.5665, 126.978);
              
              // Start navigation
              await Navigator.startNavigation(destination);
            },
            child: Text('Start Navigation'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the Kakao SDK and starts navigation to a specified destination when the button is pressed.

# Complete Example of kakao_flutter_sdk_navi

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kakao_flutter_sdk_navi/kakao_flutter_sdk_navi.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Kakao Navigation Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize Kakao SDK with your app key
              await KakaoContext.init(appKey: 'YOUR_APP_KEY');

              // Define the destination coordinates (latitude, longitude)
              final destination = LatLng(37.5665, 126.978); // Example: Seoul City Hall

              // Start navigation to the destination
              await Navigator.startNavigation(destination);
            },
            child: Text('Start Navigation'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled 'Start Navigation'.
// 2. When the button is pressed, the Kakao SDK is initialized with the provided app key.
// 3. The destination coordinates are set to a specific location (Seoul City Hall in this case).
// 4. The navigation process is initiated, which opens the Kakao navigation app with the specified destination.
// 5. Users can then follow the navigation instructions provided by Kakao's service.
