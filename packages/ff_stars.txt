# ff_stars Flutter Package

The `ff_stars` package is a Flutter library designed to provide a customizable star rating widget. This package is particularly useful for applications that require user feedback, such as review systems, product ratings, or any scenario where a visual representation of ratings is needed.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `ff_stars`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `ff_stars` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ff_stars: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the `ff_stars` widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ff_stars/ff_stars.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double rating = 3.5; // Initial rating

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Star Rating Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the star rating widget
            FFStars(
              rating: rating,
              size: 40.0, // Size of the stars
              color: Colors.amber, // Color of the stars
              onRatingChanged: (newRating) {
                setState(() {
                  rating = newRating; // Update the rating
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the current rating
            Text(
              'Current Rating: $rating',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that allows users to rate something using stars. The `FFStars` widget is used to display the stars, and the `onRatingChanged` callback updates the rating when the user interacts with the stars.

# Complete Example of `ff_stars`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ff_stars/ff_stars.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double rating = 3.5; // Initial rating

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Star Rating Example'), // Title of the app
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the star rating widget
            FFStars(
              rating: rating, // Current rating
              size: 40.0, // Size of the stars
              color: Colors.amber, // Color of the stars
              onRatingChanged: (newRating) {
                setState(() {
                  rating = newRating; // Update the rating when user interacts
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between stars and text
            // Display the current rating
            Text(
              'Current Rating: $rating', // Show the current rating
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Text style
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(), // Run the RealFlutter widget
  ));
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. The _RealFlutterState class manages the state of the widget.
// 4. The initial rating is set to 3.5.
// 5. The build method constructs the UI, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the star rating and the current rating text vertically.
// 7. The FFStars widget displays the star rating, and the onRatingChanged callback updates the rating state when the user interacts with the stars.
// 8. The current rating is displayed below the stars, updating dynamically as the user interacts with the stars.
```
