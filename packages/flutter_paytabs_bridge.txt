# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flutter PayTabs Bridge Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_paytabs_bridge` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_paytabs_bridge` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_paytabs_bridge: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <application>
       <meta-data
           android:name="paytabs.sdk.client_key"
           android:value="YOUR_PAYTABS_CLIENT_KEY"/>
       <meta-data
           android:name="paytabs.sdk.secret_key"
           android:value="YOUR_PAYTABS_SECRET_KEY"/>
   </application>
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_PAYTABS_CLIENT_KEY` and `YOUR_PAYTABS_SECRET_KEY` with your actual PayTabs credentials.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pod install
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have configured the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to initiate a payment using the `flutter_paytabs_bridge` package.

# Complete Example: Flutter PayTabs Bridge

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_paytabs_bridge/flutter_paytabs_bridge.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PayTabs Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  // Initialize PayTabs SDK
  void initiatePayment() async {
    // Create a payment request
    PayTabsRequest request = PayTabsRequest(
      profileId: 'YOUR_PROFILE_ID', // Replace with your profile ID
      amount: 10.0, // Amount to be charged
      currency: 'USD', // Currency type
      email: 'customer@example.com', // Customer's email
      // Additional parameters can be added here
    );

    // Start the payment process
    PayTabsResponse response = await PayTabsBridge.startPayment(request);

    // Handle the payment response
    if (response.status == PayTabsStatus.success) {
      // Payment was successful
      print('Payment Successful: ${response.transactionId}');
    } else {
      // Payment failed
      print('Payment Failed: ${response.message}');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PayTabs Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: initiatePayment, // Trigger payment on button press
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The PaymentScreen widget is displayed, containing a button to initiate payment.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the initiatePayment method is called.
// 4. A PayTabsRequest object is created with the necessary payment details.
// 5. The payment process is started using PayTabsBridge.startPayment().
// 6. The response is checked for success or failure, and appropriate messages are printed to the console.
```
