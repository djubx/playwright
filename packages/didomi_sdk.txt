# Setting Up the Didomi SDK in Your Flutter Project

## Installation
To add the Didomi SDK to your Flutter project, include the following dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  didomi_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/didomi_sdk).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and add the following permissions:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the Didomi SDK initialization in your `MainActivity.java` or `MainActivity.kt`:
   ```java
   import com.didomi.sdk.Didomi;

   public class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity {
       @Override
       protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
           super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
           Didomi.initialize(this);
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Usage
After setting up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and display the consent dialog.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:didomi_sdk/didomi_sdk.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Didomi SDK Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize Didomi SDK
              await Didomi.initialize();

              // Show consent dialog
              await Didomi.showConsentDialog();
            },
            child: Text('Show Consent Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Didomi SDK in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:didomi_sdk/didomi_sdk.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Didomi SDK Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize Didomi SDK
              await Didomi.initialize();

              // Show consent dialog
              await Didomi.showConsentDialog();
            },
            child: Text('Show Consent Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

// The above code defines a simple Flutter application that integrates the Didomi SDK.
// 
// 1. The `RealFlutter` class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI of the app.
// 2. Inside the `build` method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget holds an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, initializes the Didomi SDK and shows the consent dialog.
// 4. The `main` function runs the app by calling `runApp` with an instance of `RealFlutter`.
// 
// This application flow allows users to interact with the consent management system seamlessly, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
