# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Game Levels Scrolling Map Package

## Installation
To get started with the `game_levels_scrolling_map` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  game_levels_scrolling_map: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your map requires location services or other permissions.

## Basic Usage
To use the `game_levels_scrolling_map` package, you will need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:game_levels_scrolling_map/game_levels_scrolling_map.dart';
```

You can then create a simple scrolling map by using the `ScrollingMap` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
ScrollingMap(
  levels: [
    LevelData(levelName: 'Level 1', position: Offset(100, 200)),
    LevelData(levelName: 'Level 2', position: Offset(300, 400)),
    // Add more levels as needed
  ],
  onLevelTap: (level) {
    // Handle level tap
    print('Tapped on ${level.levelName}');
  },
);
```

This code snippet creates a scrolling map with two levels. The `onLevelTap` callback allows you to define what happens when a player taps on a level.

# Complete Example of Game Levels Scrolling Map

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:game_levels_scrolling_map/game_levels_scrolling_map.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Game Levels Scrolling Map',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Game Levels Map'),
        ),
        body: ScrollingMap(
          // Define the levels with their names and positions
          levels: [
            LevelData(levelName: 'Level 1', position: Offset(100, 200)),
            LevelData(levelName: 'Level 2', position: Offset(300, 400)),
            LevelData(levelName: 'Level 3', position: Offset(500, 600)),
            // Add more levels as needed
          ],
          // Handle level tap events
          onLevelTap: (level) {
            // Show a dialog with the level name when tapped
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) {
                return AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('Level Selected'),
                  content: Text('You selected ${level.levelName}'),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () {
                        Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                      },
                      child: Text('OK'),
                    ),
                  ],
                );
              },
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Game Levels Map'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold includes a ScrollingMap widget, which takes a list of LevelData objects.
// 5. Each LevelData object represents a level with a name and a position on the map.
// 6. The onLevelTap callback is defined to show an AlertDialog when a level is tapped, displaying the selected level's name.
// 7. The user can tap on any level, triggering the dialog to appear, and can dismiss it by pressing 'OK'.
