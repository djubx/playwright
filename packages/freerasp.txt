# Overview of the `freerasp` Flutter Package

The `freerasp` Flutter package is a robust tool designed to enhance the security of mobile applications by providing runtime application self-protection (RASP) capabilities. This package is particularly useful for developers who need to safeguard sensitive data and ensure the integrity of their applications against various threats such as reverse engineering, tampering, and unauthorized access.

## When to Use `freerasp`

- **Financial Applications**: Apps that handle sensitive financial data can benefit from the added security layer provided by `freerasp`.
- **Healthcare Apps**: Protect patient data and ensure compliance with regulations like HIPAA.
- **Enterprise Applications**: Secure proprietary business logic and data.
- **Any App Requiring High Security**: If your app deals with sensitive user information or critical business processes, `freerasp` can help mitigate risks.

## Key Features

- **Tamper Detection**: Detects if the app has been tampered with or modified.
- **Root/Jailbreak Detection**: Identifies if the device is rooted or jailbroken, which could compromise security.
- **Debugger Detection**: Alerts if the app is being debugged, which might indicate reverse engineering attempts.
- **Emulator Detection**: Recognizes if the app is running in an emulator, which is often used for malicious purposes.

# Setting Up and Using `freerasp` in Your Flutter Project

In this section, we'll walk through the setup process for integrating `freerasp` into a Flutter project, covering both Android and iOS platforms.

## Installation

Add `freerasp` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  freerasp: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Ensure your `AndroidManifest.xml` includes necessary permissions. Typically, `freerasp` does not require additional permissions, but verify the documentation for any updates.

2. **ProGuard Rules**: If using ProGuard, add the following rules to prevent obfuscation issues:

   ```proguard
   -keep class com.yourpackage.freerasp.** { *; }
   ```

3. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `build.gradle` files are set up to support the package. This might include setting the minimum SDK version to a required level.

## iOS Configuration

1. **Podfile**: Ensure your `Podfile` is updated to include the `freerasp` dependencies. Run `pod install` after updating.

2. **Entitlements**: Check if any specific entitlements are required for the package to function correctly.

3. **Build Settings**: Adjust any necessary build settings in Xcode, such as enabling bitcode if required by the package.

## Using `freerasp`

To use `freerasp`, import it into your Dart code and initialize it in your main application class. Here's a basic setup:

```dart
import 'package:freerasp/freerasp.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final _rasp = FreeRasp();

  void initialize() {
    _rasp.initialize();
  }

  void checkSecurity() {
    if (_rasp.isTampered) {
      // Handle tampering
    }
    if (_rasp.isRooted) {
      // Handle rooted device
    }
  }
}
```

<-- MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:freerasp/freerasp.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create an instance of RealFlutter to manage security checks
  final RealFlutter securityManager = RealFlutter();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize security checks when the app starts
    securityManager.initialize();

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Secure App',
      home: HomeScreen(securityManager: securityManager),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final RealFlutter securityManager;

  HomeScreen({required this.securityManager});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Perform security checks and display alerts if necessary
    securityManager.checkSecurity();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Secure App Home'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Secure App!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter {
  final FreeRasp _rasp = FreeRasp();

  // Initialize the RASP system
  void initialize() {
    _rasp.initialize();
  }

  // Check for various security threats
  void checkSecurity() {
    if (_rasp.isTampered) {
      // Alert the user or log the incident
      print('Warning: App has been tampered with!');
    }
    if (_rasp.isRooted) {
      // Alert the user or log the incident
      print('Warning: Device is rooted!');
    }
    if (_rasp.isDebuggerAttached) {
      // Alert the user or log the incident
      print('Warning: Debugger is attached!');
    }
    if (_rasp.isEmulator) {
      // Alert the user or log the incident
      print('Warning: App is running on an emulator!');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the RealFlutter class, which sets up the RASP system.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, and security checks are performed immediately.
// 3. If any security threat is detected (tampering, rooting, debugging, emulation), a warning is printed to the console.
// 4. The app continues to run, but developers can add additional logic to handle these threats, such as disabling certain features or alerting the user.
