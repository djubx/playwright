Localization is essential for creating apps that cater to a global audience, allowing developers to provide content in multiple languages and formats. This package simplifies the process of managing localized strings and resources, making it easier to create a user-friendly experience for diverse users.

## When to Use l10n_flutter

You should consider using the `l10n_flutter` package when:
- You are developing an application that targets users from different linguistic backgrounds.
- You need to manage multiple languages and want to streamline the localization process.
- You want to ensure that your app adheres to internationalization best practices.

## Key Features

- **Easy Localization Management**: Simplifies the process of managing localized strings and resources.
- **Support for Multiple Languages**: Easily switch between different languages based on user preferences or device settings.
- **Integration with Flutter's Build System**: Seamlessly integrates with Flutter's build system for efficient localization.

# Setting Up l10n_flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `l10n_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `l10n_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  l10n_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/l10n_flutter).

## Step 2: Configure Localization

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file.
2. Ensure that the `android:configChanges` attribute includes `locale`.

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|smallestScreenSize|locale">
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to support localization:

```xml
<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
<array>
    <string>en</string>
    <string>es</string>
    <string>fr</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Create Localization Files

Create a directory named `l10n` in your `lib` folder. Inside this directory, create JSON files for each language you want to support, for example:

- `en.json`
- `es.json`
- `fr.json`

Each JSON file should contain key-value pairs for the strings you want to localize.

## Step 4: Initialize l10n_flutter

In your main application file, initialize the `l10n_flutter` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:l10n_flutter/l10n_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LocalizedApp(
      supportedLocales: [Locale('en'), Locale('es'), Locale('fr')],
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Localization Demo',
        home: RealFlutter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Now your app is ready to use localized strings!

# Complete Example of l10n_flutter

Here is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `l10n_flutter` package. This example demonstrates how to set up localization and use localized strings in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:l10n_flutter/l10n_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LocalizedApp(
      supportedLocales: [Locale('en'), Locale('es'), Locale('fr')],
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Localization Demo',
        home: RealFlutter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Retrieve the localized strings based on the current locale
    final localizedStrings = Localized.of(context);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(localizedStrings.appTitle), // Localized app title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(localizedStrings.welcomeMessage), // Localized welcome message
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Change the locale to Spanish
                Localized.of(context).changeLocale(Locale('es'));
              },
              child: Text(localizedStrings.changeLanguage), // Localized button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the LocalizedApp with supported locales and the MaterialApp.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 4. Inside RealFlutter, localized strings are retrieved using Localized.of(context).
// 5. The app bar title and body text are displayed using localized strings.
// 6. A button allows users to change the language to Spanish, demonstrating dynamic localization.
