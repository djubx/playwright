// The app starts by creating a MaterialApp and passing the localizationsDelegates and supportedLocales.
// The localizationsDelegates is a list of delegates that handle the localization of the app.
// The supportedLocales is a list of locales that the app supports.
// In this case, we're using the L10nFlutterDelegate and supporting English and French locales.
//
// The L10nFlutterDelegate is created and passed a translationLoader.
// The translationLoader is responsible for loading the translations from a file.
// In this case, we're using the FileTranslationLoader and setting the basePath to the assets/translations directory.
//
// The app then uses the L10nFlutter class to translate the 'hello_world' key.
// The L10nFlutter class is used to access the translations and format them according to the current locale.
//
// The app displays the translated text in the appBar and body of the Scaffold.
