# Curo Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **Curo** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to implement a robust and flexible state management solution. It provides a simple yet effective way to manage application state, making it easier to build responsive and maintainable applications. 

## When to Use Curo
Curo is particularly useful in scenarios where:
- You need to manage complex state across multiple widgets.
- You want to implement a reactive programming model.
- You are looking for a lightweight alternative to more complex state management solutions like Provider or Bloc.

## Key Features
- **Reactive State Management**: Curo allows you to create reactive state models that automatically update the UI when the state changes.
- **Lightweight**: The package is designed to be minimalistic, ensuring that it does not bloat your application.
- **Easy Integration**: Curo can be easily integrated into existing Flutter applications without significant refactoring.
- **Support for Multiple State Types**: You can manage different types of states, including simple values, lists, and more complex objects.

With these features, Curo stands out as a versatile option for Flutter developers looking to streamline their state management processes.

# Curo Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with Curo, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  curo: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/curo).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
Curo does not require any specific platform configurations for Android or iOS. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

## Basic Usage
To use Curo in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Package**: Import Curo in your Dart file.
   ```dart
   import 'package:curo/curo.dart';
   ```

2. **Create a State Model**: Define a state model that extends `CuroState`.
   ```dart
   class MyState extends CuroState {
     int counter = 0;

     void increment() {
       counter++;
       notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners about the state change
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Use Curo in Your Widget**: Wrap your widget with `CuroProvider` and use the state model.
   ```dart
   class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return CuroProvider<MyState>(
         create: (context) => MyState(),
         child: MaterialApp(
           home: HomeScreen(),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Access State in Widgets**: Use `CuroConsumer` to access and modify the state.
   ```dart
   class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return CuroConsumer<MyState>(
         builder: (context, state) {
           return Scaffold(
             appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Curo Example')),
             body: Center(
               child: Column(
                 mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                 children: [
                   Text('Counter: ${state.counter}'),
                   ElevatedButton(
                     onPressed: state.increment,
                     child: Text('Increment'),
                   ),
                 ],
               ),
             ),
           );
         },
       );
     }
   }
   ```

With these steps, you can effectively set up and use the Curo package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Curo in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:curo/curo.dart';

// Define the state model that extends CuroState
class MyState extends CuroState {
  int counter = 0; // Initialize the counter

  // Method to increment the counter
  void increment() {
    counter++; // Increment the counter
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners about the state change
  }
}

// Main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CuroProvider<MyState>(
      create: (context) => MyState(), // Create an instance of MyState
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: HomeScreen(), // Set the home screen
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CuroConsumer<MyState>(
      builder: (context, state) {
        return Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Curo Example')), // App bar title
          body: Center(
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Text('Counter: ${state.counter}'), // Display the counter
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: state.increment, // Increment counter on press
                  child: Text('Increment'), // Button text
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the `main()` function, which calls `runApp()` to launch the `RealFlutter` widget.
2. `RealFlutter` sets up a `CuroProvider` with an instance of `MyState`, making the state available to its child widgets.
3. The `HomeScreen` widget is displayed, which uses `CuroConsumer` to listen for changes in the state.
4. The current value of the counter is displayed in the center of the screen.
5. When the "Increment" button is pressed, the `increment()` method of `MyState` is called, which updates the counter and notifies all listeners.
6. The UI automatically rebuilds to reflect the updated counter value.
