# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `alphabet_search_view`

## Installation
To get started with the `alphabet_search_view` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  alphabet_search_view: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/alphabet_search_view).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `alphabet_search_view`, you will typically follow these steps:
1. Import the package in your Dart file.
2. Create a list of items that you want to display.
3. Use the `AlphabetSearchView` widget to display the list and enable searching.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alphabet_search_view/alphabet_search_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for the search view
    final List<String> items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Fig', 'Grape'];

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Alphabet Search View Example')),
      body: AlphabetSearchView(
        data: items,
        itemBuilder: (context, item) {
          return ListTile(title: Text(item));
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple list of fruits and display them using the `AlphabetSearchView` widget. The `itemBuilder` is used to define how each item in the list should be displayed.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `alphabet_search_view` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of `alphabet_search_view`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alphabet_search_view/alphabet_search_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for the search view
    final List<String> items = [
      'Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Fig', 'Grape', 
      'Honeydew', 'Kiwi', 'Lemon', 'Mango', 'Nectarine', 'Orange'
    ];

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Alphabet Search View Example')),
      body: AlphabetSearchView(
        data: items, // The list of items to be displayed
        itemBuilder: (context, item) {
          // This function defines how each item will be displayed
          return ListTile(title: Text(item));
        },
        // Optional: Customize the search view
        searchDecoration: InputDecoration(
          hintText: 'Search fruits...',
          border: OutlineInputBorder(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(),
  ));
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we define a list of fruit names.
// 3. The Scaffold widget provides a basic material design layout with an AppBar.
// 4. The AlphabetSearchView widget is used to display the list of fruits.
// 5. The itemBuilder function is called for each item in the list, creating a ListTile for each fruit.
// 6. The searchDecoration property allows customization of the search input field.
// 7. When the user types in the search field, the list is filtered based on the input, providing a seamless search experience.
