# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animate Text

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `animate_text` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animate_text: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:animate_text/animate_text.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `AnimateText` widget in your Flutter application. Below are platform-specific details for Android and iOS:

### Android

Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 5: Example Usage

You can use the `AnimateText` widget as follows:

```dart
AnimateText(
  'Hello, Flutter!',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 32.0, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
  duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
  animationType: AnimationType.Fade,
)
```

This will create a fade-in effect for the text "Hello, Flutter!" over a duration of 2 seconds.

With these steps, you are now ready to implement animated text in your Flutter application using the `animate_text` package!

# Complete Example of Animate Text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animate_text/animate_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animate Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animate Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Using AnimateText widget to display animated text
              AnimateText(
                'Welcome to RealFlutter!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24.0, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Animation duration
                animationType: AnimationType.Fade, // Type of animation
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between texts
              AnimateText(
                'Let\'s animate some text!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20.0, fontStyle: FontStyle.italic),
                duration: Duration(seconds: 3), // Different duration
                animationType: AnimationType.Scale, // Different animation type
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the animated text vertically.
// 5. The first AnimateText widget displays "Welcome to RealFlutter!" with a fade animation over 2 seconds.
// 6. A SizedBox is used to add space between the two text animations.
// 7. The second AnimateText widget displays "Let's animate some text!" with a scale animation over 3 seconds.
// 8. The app showcases how to use the animate_text package effectively to create engaging text animations.
