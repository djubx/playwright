# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Expansion Tile Card Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `expansion_tile_card` package, you first need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  expansion_tile_card: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the `ExpansionTileCard`, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:expansion_tile_card/expansion_tile_card.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the ExpansionTileCard Widget

You can now use the `ExpansionTileCard` widget in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ExpansionTileCard(
  title: Text('Card Title'),
  children: <Widget>[
    Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Text('This is the content of the card.'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
  
  ```gradle
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

## Step 4: Customization Options

You can customize the `ExpansionTileCard` by modifying its properties, such as `backgroundColor`, `expandedBackgroundColor`, and `elevation`. Hereâ€™s an example:

```dart
ExpansionTileCard(
  title: Text('Custom Card'),
  backgroundColor: Colors.white,
  expandedBackgroundColor: Colors.blue[50],
  elevation: 4,
  children: <Widget>[
    Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Text('This is the expanded content.'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

With these steps, you can easily set up and use the `expansion_tile_card` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Expansion Tile Card

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:expansion_tile_card/expansion_tile_card.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Expansion Tile Card Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Expansion Tile Card Example'),
        ),
        body: ListView(
          children: <Widget>[
            // Creating an ExpansionTileCard widget
            ExpansionTileCard(
              title: Text('Card 1'),
              // The content that will be shown when the card is expanded
              children: <Widget>[
                Padding(
                  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                  child: Text('This is the content of Card 1.'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
            ExpansionTileCard(
              title: Text('Card 2'),
              children: <Widget>[
                Padding(
                  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                  child: Text('This is the content of Card 2.'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
            ExpansionTileCard(
              title: Text('Card 3'),
              children: <Widget>[
                Padding(
                  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                  child: Text('This is the content of Card 3.'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Expansion Tile Card Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a ListView that contains multiple ExpansionTileCard widgets.
// 5. Each ExpansionTileCard has a title and a child widget that displays content when expanded.
// 6. When a user taps on a card title, the card expands to reveal the content, providing an interactive experience.
