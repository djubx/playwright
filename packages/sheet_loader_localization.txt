<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `sheet_loader_localization` Flutter package is designed to simplify the process of loading and managing localized strings in Flutter applications. It provides a straightforward way to handle localization, making it easier for developers to support multiple languages and regions in their apps.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `sheet_loader_localization` package when:
- You are developing a Flutter application that needs to support multiple languages.
- You want to manage localization strings efficiently without hardcoding them in your application.
- You prefer to load localization data from external sources, such as Google Sheets, which can be updated without requiring a new app release.

## Features

- **Dynamic Loading**: Load localization strings from Google Sheets, allowing for real-time updates.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.
- **Support for Multiple Languages**: Easily manage and switch between different languages.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to customize the loading process and handle localization according to their needs.

By leveraging this package, developers can enhance the user experience by providing localized content that can be easily updated and maintained.

# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `sheet_loader_localization` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sheet_loader_localization: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Configure Google Sheets

1. Create a Google Sheet with your localization strings. Each column should represent a different language, and each row should represent a different key.
2. Publish the Google Sheet to the web to make it accessible. Go to `File` > `Publish to the web`, and choose the appropriate options.
3. Copy the link to the published sheet.

### Step 3: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, initialize the localization loader. You will need to provide the URL of your published Google Sheet.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sheet_loader_localization/sheet_loader_localization.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Localization Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Load Localization Strings

In your `HomeScreen` widget, load the localization strings using the `RealFlutter` class provided by the package.

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  late Future<Map<String, String>> _localization;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _localization = RealFlutter.loadLocalization('YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_URL');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Localization Example')),
      body: FutureBuilder<Map<String, String>>(
        future: _localization,
        builder: (context, snapshot) {
          if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
            return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
          } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
            return Center(child: Text('Error loading localization'));
          } else {
            return Center(child: Text(snapshot.data!['welcome_message']!));
          }
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure that you have the appropriate settings in your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

### Optimizations

- Consider caching the localization data to improve performance and reduce network calls.
- Implement error handling to manage cases where the Google Sheet is not accessible.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sheet_loader_localization/sheet_loader_localization.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Localization Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Future variable to hold the localization data
  late Future<Map<String, String>> _localization;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load localization strings from Google Sheets
    _localization = RealFlutter.loadLocalization('YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_URL');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Localization Example')),
      body: FutureBuilder<Map<String, String>>(
        future: _localization,
        builder: (context, snapshot) {
          // Check the connection state
          if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
            // Show a loading indicator while waiting for data
            return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
          } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
            // Display an error message if loading fails
            return Center(child: Text('Error loading localization'));
          } else {
            // Display the localized welcome message
            return Center(child: Text(snapshot.data!['welcome_message']!));
          }
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp and sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen initializes the localization loading process in initState.
// 4. The FutureBuilder widget is used to handle the asynchronous loading of localization data.
// 5. While waiting for the data, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 6. If an error occurs during loading, an error message is shown.
// 7. Once the data is loaded successfully, the localized welcome message is displayed on the screen.
