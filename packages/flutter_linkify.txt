# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_linkify`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_linkify` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_linkify: ^6.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_linkify/flutter_linkify.dart';
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart'; // Required for launching URLs
```

## Step 3: Using Linkify in Your Widget

You can use the `Linkify` widget to display text with links. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

```dart
Linkify(
  text: 'Check out https://flutter.dev and email me at example@example.com #Flutter',
  onOpen: (link) async {
    // Handle link tap
    if (await canLaunch(link.url)) {
      await launch(link.url);
    } else {
      throw 'Could not launch ${link.url}';
    }
  },
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android
Make sure you have internet permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

#### iOS
For iOS, ensure you have the following in your `Info.plist` to allow HTTP requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Customizing Link Styles

You can customize the style of the links using the `linkStyle` property:

```dart
Linkify(
  text: 'Visit https://flutter.dev',
  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black),
  linkStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
  onOpen: (link) async {
    // Handle link tap
  },
)
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate `flutter_linkify` into your Flutter application and enhance the interactivity of your text content.

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_linkify`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_linkify/flutter_linkify.dart';
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Linkify Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Linkify Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Linkify(
              text: 'Check out https://flutter.dev and email me at example@example.com #Flutter',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18.0), // Style for normal text
              linkStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold), // Style for links
              onOpen: (link) async {
                // This function is called when a link is tapped
                if (await canLaunch(link.url)) {
                  await launch(link.url); // Launch the URL
                } else {
                  throw 'Could not launch ${link.url}'; // Error handling
                }
              },
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. Inside the Center, a Padding widget adds space around the Linkify widget.
// 5. The Linkify widget takes a string of text that includes a URL and an email address.
// 6. The style property sets the font size for normal text, while linkStyle customizes the appearance of links.
// 7. The onOpen callback is triggered when a link is tapped, checking if the URL can be launched and then launching it.
// 8. If the URL cannot be launched, an error is thrown, providing feedback to the user.
