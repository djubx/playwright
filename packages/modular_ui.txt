Here's a detailed technical blog on the "modular_ui" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Modular UI Flutter Package

The **modular_ui** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create modular and reusable UI components. This package allows developers to build complex user interfaces by breaking them down into smaller, manageable pieces. It promotes a clean architecture and enhances code maintainability, making it easier to manage large applications.

## When to Use Modular UI

You should consider using the **modular_ui** package when:
- You are developing a large-scale application that requires a consistent UI across multiple screens.
- You want to implement a design system that can be reused throughout your app.
- You need to separate concerns in your UI code, making it easier to test and maintain.

## Key Features
- **Modularity**: Create reusable UI components that can be easily integrated into different parts of your application.
- **Customizability**: Easily customize components to fit your design needs without altering the core functionality.
- **Scalability**: Build applications that can grow in complexity without becoming unmanageable.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing Flutter widgets and libraries.

By leveraging the **modular_ui** package, developers can enhance their productivity and create high-quality applications with a consistent look and feel.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Modular UI

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **modular_ui** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **modular_ui** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  modular_ui: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using Modular UI

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple modular UI component. We will create a reusable button component.

### Creating a Reusable Button

Create a new Dart file named `custom_button.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class CustomButton extends StatelessWidget {
  final String label;
  final VoidCallback onPressed;

  const CustomButton({Key? key, required this.label, required this.onPressed}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: onPressed,
      child: Text(label),
    );
  }
}
```

### Integrating the Button in Your App

Now, let's use this button in our main application file. 

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'custom_button.dart'; // Importing the custom button component

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Starting the application with the RealFlutter widget
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Modular UI Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Modular UI Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomButton(
            label: 'Click Me', // Setting the button label
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform when the button is pressed
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) {
                  return AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Button Pressed'),
                    content: Text('You have pressed the button!'),
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () {
                          Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                        },
                        child: Text('OK'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  );
                },
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds our CustomButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, an AlertDialog is displayed, confirming the button press.
// 5. The user can dismiss the dialog by pressing the 'OK' button, which calls Navigator.of(context).pop() to close the dialog.
```
