// The app starts by creating an instance of the DioCacheInterceptorObjectboxStore class.
// This instance is then passed to the Dio HTTP client, which is used to make requests to the API endpoint.
// When the user presses the "Load Data" button, the app makes a GET request to the API endpoint using the Dio HTTP client.
// The response from the API endpoint is then stored in the ObjectBox database using the DioCacheInterceptorObjectboxStore instance.
// If the same request is made again, the app will retrieve the cached response from the ObjectBox database instead of making a new request to the API endpoint.
// The cached response is then displayed in the UI.
