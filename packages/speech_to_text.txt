# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Speech to Text Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `speech_to_text` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  speech_to_text: ^5.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
   ```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries:

   ```xml
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your microphone for speech recognition.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:speech_to_text/speech_to_text.dart';
```

## Step 4: Initialize and Use the Package
You can now initialize and use the `speech_to_text` package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to set it up.

# Complete Example of Using Speech to Text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:speech_to_text/speech_to_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  SpeechToText _speechToText; // Instance of SpeechToText
  bool _isListening = false; // Listening state
  String _text = ''; // Transcribed text

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _speechToText = SpeechToText(); // Initialize the speech recognizer
  }

  // Function to start listening
  void _startListening() async {
    await _speechToText.initialize(); // Initialize the speech recognizer
    setState(() {
      _isListening = true; // Update listening state
    });
    _speechToText.listen(onResult: (result) {
      setState(() {
        _text = result.recognizedWords; // Update the transcribed text
      });
    });
  }

  // Function to stop listening
  void _stopListening() async {
    await _speechToText.stop(); // Stop the speech recognizer
    setState(() {
      _isListening = false; // Update listening state
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Speech to Text Example'), // App title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                _text, // Display the transcribed text
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _isListening ? _stopListening : _startListening, // Toggle listening
                child: Text(_isListening ? 'Stop Listening' : 'Start Listening'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize the SpeechToText instance.
// 3. The _startListening function initializes the speech recognizer and starts listening for speech input.
// 4. The recognized words are updated in the _text variable, which is displayed on the screen.
// 5. The _stopListening function stops the speech recognizer and updates the listening state.
// 6. The UI consists of a text widget to display the transcribed text and a button to start/stop listening.
```
