# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_place_picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_place_picker` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_place_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_place_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_place_picker).

## Step 2: Configure Google Maps API

### For Android

1. Open your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file.
2. Add the following permissions and your Google Maps API key inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application>
        <!-- Other configurations -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
            android:value="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### For iOS

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following keys to request location permissions and include your Google Maps API key:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show places near you.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show places near you.</string>
<key>GMSApiKey</key>
<string>YOUR_API_KEY_HERE</string>
```

## Step 3: Implementing the Place Picker

Now that we have set up the package, let's implement the place picker in our Flutter application.

### Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `flutter_place_picker` package in your app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_place_picker/flutter_place_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Place Picker Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Place Picker Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Open the place picker
              LocationResult result = await Navigator.of(context).push(
                MaterialPageRoute(
                  builder: (context) => PlacePicker(
                    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE', // Your Google Maps API Key
                    onPlacePicked: (result) {
                      // Handle the selected place
                      print(result.formattedAddress);
                      Navigator.of(context).pop(result);
                    },
                  ),
                ),
              );

              // Display the selected place
              if (result != null) {
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Selected: ${result.formattedAddress}')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pick a Place'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that opens the place picker. When a user selects a place, the formatted address is printed to the console and displayed in a snackbar.

# Complete Example of flutter_place_picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_place_picker/flutter_place_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Place Picker Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Place Picker Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Open the place picker
              LocationResult result = await Navigator.of(context).push(
                MaterialPageRoute(
                  builder: (context) => PlacePicker(
                    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE', // Your Google Maps API Key
                    onPlacePicked: (result) {
                      // Handle the selected place
                      print(result.formattedAddress);
                      Navigator.of(context).pop(result);
                    },
                  ),
                ),
              );

              // Display the selected place
              if (result != null) {
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Selected: ${result.formattedAddress}')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pick a Place'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title "Place Picker Example".
// 4. The body contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it navigates to the PlacePicker screen.
// 6. The PlacePicker allows the user to select a location on the map.
// 7. Once a place is picked, the onPlacePicked callback is triggered, printing the formatted address to the console and popping the picker off the navigation stack.
// 8. If a place is selected, a snackbar displays the selected address to the user.
