# Heart Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Heart package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  heart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities related to heart animations.

## Using the Heart Package
To use the Heart package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:heart/heart.dart';
```

You can then create heart animations and interactive components in your widget tree. Below is a simple example of how to implement a heart button that animates when pressed.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:heart/heart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Heart Animation Example',
      home: HeartAnimationScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HeartAnimationScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HeartAnimationScreenState createState() => _HeartAnimationScreenState();
}

class _HeartAnimationScreenState extends State<HeartAnimationScreen> {
  // Variable to track the heart animation state
  bool _isHearted = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Heart Animation Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: GestureDetector(
          // Detects taps on the heart button
          onTap: () {
            setState(() {
              // Toggle the heart state
              _isHearted = !_isHearted;
            });
          },
          child: Heart(
            // Heart widget from the Heart package
            isHearted: _isHearted,
            size: 100.0, // Size of the heart
            color: _isHearted ? Colors.red : Colors.grey, // Color changes based on state
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300), // Animation duration
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HeartAnimationScreen is a stateful widget that manages the heart's state.
// 4. The heart's state (_isHearted) is toggled when the user taps on the heart.
// 5. The Heart widget displays a heart that changes color and size based on the _isHearted state.
// 6. The heart animates smoothly between states, providing visual feedback to the user.
```
