# Wheel Slider Flutter Package: An Overview

The `wheel_slider` Flutter package is a versatile and user-friendly widget that allows developers to create a wheel-style slider in their Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful when you want to provide users with a unique and interactive way to select values, such as choosing a number, selecting a date, or adjusting settings.

## When to Use the Wheel Slider

- **Numeric Selection**: Ideal for scenarios where users need to select a number from a predefined range, such as setting a timer or choosing a quantity.
- **Date and Time Pickers**: Can be used to create custom date or time pickers that offer a more engaging experience than traditional dropdowns.
- **Settings Adjustment**: Useful for adjusting settings like volume, brightness, or any other parameter that benefits from a circular slider interface.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: Offers various customization options for colors, sizes, and styles to match your app's theme.
- **Smooth Animation**: Provides smooth and responsive animations for a seamless user experience.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter projects with minimal setup.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Setting Up and Using the Wheel Slider Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `wheel_slider` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `wheel_slider` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wheel_slider: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:wheel_slider/wheel_slider.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

To use the `wheel_slider`, you need to include it in your widget tree. Here is a basic example:

```dart
WheelSlider(
  onChanged: (value) {
    print('Selected value: $value');
  },
  totalCount: 100,
  initValue: 50,
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
minSdkVersion 21
```

### iOS

Make sure your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least iOS 9.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: Use `const` constructors where possible to improve performance.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that the slider is accessible by providing semantic labels.

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File with Wheel Slider

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `wheel_slider` package. This example demonstrates all key features of the package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wheel_slider/wheel_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Wheel Slider Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: WheelSliderDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class WheelSliderDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WheelSliderDemoState createState() => _WheelSliderDemoState();
}

class _WheelSliderDemoState extends State<WheelSliderDemo> {
  int _selectedValue = 50; // Initial value for the slider

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Wheel Slider Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Selected Value: $_selectedValue',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            WheelSlider(
              totalCount: 100, // Total number of values in the slider
              initValue: _selectedValue, // Initial value of the slider
              onChanged: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  _selectedValue = value; // Update the selected value
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts by running the `MyApp` class, which is a stateless widget.
// `MyApp` sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies `WheelSliderDemo` as the home widget.
// `WheelSliderDemo` is a stateful widget that manages the state of the selected value from the wheel slider.
// The `_selectedValue` variable holds the current value selected by the user.
// The `build` method of `_WheelSliderDemoState` returns a Scaffold widget with an AppBar and a body containing a Column.
// The Column displays the current selected value and the `WheelSlider` widget.
// The `WheelSlider` is configured with a `totalCount` of 100 and an `initValue` of `_selectedValue`.
// When the slider value changes, the `onChanged` callback updates `_selectedValue` and triggers a UI rebuild to reflect the new value.
