# Complete Example of flutter_image_carousel_slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_image_carousel_slider/flutter_image_carousel_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Carousel Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Image Carousel Slider'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CarouselSlider(
            items: [
              // List of images to display in the carousel
              Image.network('https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Image+1'),
              Image.network('https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Image+2'),
              Image.network('https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Image+3'),
            ],
            options: CarouselOptions(
              height: 400, // Height of the carousel
              autoPlay: true, // Enable autoplay
              autoPlayInterval: Duration(seconds: 3), // Duration between slides
              enlargeCenterPage: true, // Enlarge the center page
              enableInfiniteScroll: true, // Enable infinite scrolling
              pageSnapping: true, // Enable snapping to pages
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Image Carousel Slider".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a CarouselSlider widget.
// 5. The CarouselSlider takes a list of Image.network widgets as items, displaying images from the internet.
// 6. The options for the carousel are set, including height, autoplay settings, and infinite scrolling.
// 7. The carousel automatically transitions between images every 3 seconds, providing a smooth user experience.
