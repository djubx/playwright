# StageXL Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

StageXL is a powerful 2D game engine for Flutter that allows developers to create rich, interactive graphics and animations. It is particularly useful for building games, interactive applications, and visualizations that require high-performance rendering. With StageXL, developers can leverage the capabilities of the Flutter framework while enjoying the flexibility and performance of a dedicated game engine.

## When to Use StageXL
- **Game Development**: Ideal for creating 2D games with complex animations and graphics.
- **Interactive Applications**: Suitable for applications that require real-time graphics and user interactions.
- **Visualizations**: Great for data visualizations that need to be dynamic and visually appealing.

## Key Features
- **High-Performance Rendering**: Utilizes the GPU for rendering, ensuring smooth animations and graphics.
- **Rich Animation Support**: Offers a variety of animation options, including tweening and sprite animations.
- **Scene Management**: Provides a robust scene management system to handle multiple layers and objects.
- **Event Handling**: Supports mouse and touch events for interactive applications.
- **Asset Management**: Simplifies the loading and management of images, sounds, and other assets.

StageXL is an excellent choice for developers looking to create visually stunning applications with Flutter. Its performance and flexibility make it a standout option in the Flutter ecosystem.

# StageXL Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the StageXL package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Installation

To get started with StageXL, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stagexl: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain capabilities in your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. Ensure you have the following:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

## Basic Usage

Now that we have set up StageXL, let's create a simple application that demonstrates its capabilities.

1. Import the StageXL package in your Dart file.
2. Create a `Stage` and add it to your Flutter widget tree.
3. Use `Sprite` and `BitmapData` to display images and create animations.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stagexl/stagexl.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'StageXL Example',
      home: StageXLExample(),
    );
  }
}

class StageXLExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StageXLExampleState createState() => _StageXLExampleState();
}

class _StageXLExampleState extends State<StageXLExample> {
  late Stage _stage; // Declare a Stage variable
  late RenderTexture _renderTexture; // Declare a RenderTexture variable

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize StageXL
    _stage = Stage(querySelector('#stage'), width: 800, height: 600);
    _renderTexture = RenderTexture(800, 600); // Create a RenderTexture
    _stage.addChild(_renderTexture); // Add RenderTexture to the stage

    // Load assets and start the animation
    _loadAssets();
  }

  void _loadAssets() {
    // Load an image asset
    BitmapData.load('assets/my_image.png').then((bitmapData) {
      // Create a sprite from the loaded image
      Sprite sprite = Sprite(bitmapData);
      sprite.x = 100; // Set the x position
      sprite.y = 100; // Set the y position
      _renderTexture.addChild(sprite); // Add sprite to RenderTexture

      // Start an animation
      _animateSprite(sprite);
    });
  }

  void _animateSprite(Sprite sprite) {
    // Animate the sprite with a simple tween
    sprite.tween('x', 500, 2.0, Transition.easeInOut); // Move to x=500 over 2 seconds
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('StageXL Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Container(
          width: 800,
          height: 600,
          child: HtmlElementView(viewType: 'stage'), // Embed the Stage
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The main function initializes the Flutter app and sets up the main widget.
// The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// The StageXLExample class is a StatefulWidget that manages the StageXL setup.

// In the initState method, we initialize the Stage and RenderTexture.
// The Stage is created with a specific width and height, and the RenderTexture is added to it.

// The _loadAssets method loads an image asset and creates a Sprite from it.
// The sprite is positioned on the stage, and then we call _animateSprite to start the animation.

// The _animateSprite method uses a tween to animate the sprite's x position from its initial value to 500 over 2 seconds.
// The animation uses an ease-in-out transition for a smooth effect.

// Finally, the build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Container that holds the StageXL view.
```

### Summary
In this blog post, we explored the StageXL package for Flutter, detailing its features, installation process, and usage. We provided a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates how to set up a Stage, load assets, and animate sprites. The application flow was explained step-by-step through comments in the code, making it easy to understand how to leverage StageXL for creating interactive graphics and animations in Flutter.
