# Overview of the x509 Flutter Package

The `x509` package in Flutter is a powerful library designed for handling X.509 certificates. It provides functionalities to parse, validate, and manipulate X.509 certificates, which are widely used in secure communications over networks. This package is particularly useful for developers working on applications that require secure connections, such as those involving HTTPS, SSL/TLS, or any form of secure data transmission.

## When to Use the x509 Package
- **Secure Communication**: When your application needs to establish secure connections using SSL/TLS.
- **Certificate Validation**: To validate the authenticity of certificates received from servers.
- **Certificate Parsing**: When you need to extract information from X.509 certificates, such as issuer, subject, and validity periods.

## Key Features
- **Certificate Parsing**: Easily parse X.509 certificates from DER or PEM formats.
- **Validation**: Validate certificates against a set of rules, including expiration checks.
- **Support for Extensions**: Handle various extensions defined in X.509 certificates.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

The `x509` package is essential for developers looking to implement secure communication protocols in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the x509 Package

## Installation
To use the `x509` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  x509: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain capabilities in your Xcode project, especially if you are dealing with secure connections. Make sure to set the appropriate permissions in your `Info.plist` file.

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `x509` package to parse and validate an X.509 certificate:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:x509/x509.dart';
```

2. Load a certificate from a PEM string:

```dart
String pemCertificate = '''-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDXTCCAkWgAwIBAgIJAL5...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----''';

final cert = X509Certificate.fromPem(pemCertificate);
```

3. Validate the certificate:

```dart
if (cert.isValid) {
  print('Certificate is valid.');
} else {
  print('Certificate is invalid.');
}
```

This basic setup allows you to parse and validate X.509 certificates in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the x509 Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:x509/x509.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'X.509 Certificate Example',
      home: CertificateScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CertificateScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample PEM certificate string
    String pemCertificate = '''-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDXTCCAkWgAwIBAgIJAL5...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----''';

    // Parse the certificate from the PEM string
    final cert = X509Certificate.fromPem(pemCertificate);

    // Validate the certificate
    bool isValid = cert.isValid;

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('X.509 Certificate Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          isValid ? 'Certificate is valid.' : 'Certificate is invalid.',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// Inside RealFlutter, we set up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// The home screen is CertificateScreen, which contains the logic for parsing and validating the certificate.
// We define a sample PEM certificate string and parse it using the x509 package.
// The validity of the certificate is checked, and a message is displayed on the screen indicating whether the certificate is valid or not.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->
```

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application starts with the `main()` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
- The `RealFlutter` widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with a title and a home screen.
- The `CertificateScreen` widget contains the logic for parsing and validating the X.509 certificate.
- A sample PEM certificate string is defined and parsed using the `x509` package.
- The validity of the certificate is checked, and a message is displayed on the screen indicating whether the certificate is valid or invalid.

This example demonstrates how to effectively use the `x509` package in a Flutter application, providing a clear understanding of its capabilities and usage.
