# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Progress Line Package

## Installation
To use the `progress_line` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  progress_line: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities. However, the `progress_line` package does not require any special permissions.

## Basic Usage
To use the `progress_line` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:progress_line/progress_line.dart';
```

You can then use the `ProgressLine` widget in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ProgressLine(
  progress: 0.5, // Progress value between 0.0 and 1.0
  color: Colors.blue, // Color of the progress line
  height: 5.0, // Height of the line
  backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color of the line
)
```

This will create a progress line that is 50% filled with a blue color against a grey background.

# Complete Example of Using Progress Line

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:progress_line/progress_line.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Progress Line Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Progress Line Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ProgressDemo(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ProgressDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ProgressDemoState createState() => _ProgressDemoState();
}

class _ProgressDemoState extends State<ProgressDemo> {
  double _progress = 0.0; // Initialize progress to 0.0

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _simulateProgress(); // Start simulating progress
  }

  // Simulate progress over time
  void _simulateProgress() async {
    for (int i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
      await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 50)); // Delay for 50ms
      setState(() {
        _progress = i / 100; // Update progress
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the progress line
        ProgressLine(
          progress: _progress, // Pass the current progress
          color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the progress line
          height: 10.0, // Set the height of the line
          backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Set the background color
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space
        Text('${(_progress * 100).toStringAsFixed(0)}%'), // Display percentage
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds ProgressDemo.
// 4. ProgressDemo is a StatefulWidget that manages its own state.
// 5. In initState, _simulateProgress is called to start updating the progress.
// 6. _simulateProgress updates the _progress variable every 50 milliseconds.
// 7. The build method displays a ProgressLine widget and a Text widget showing the current percentage.
// 8. As _progress updates, the UI reflects the changes in the progress line and percentage text.
