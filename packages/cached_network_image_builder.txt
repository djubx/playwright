# Cached Network Image Builder in Flutter

The `cached_network_image_builder` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of loading and caching images from the internet. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where images are fetched from remote servers, as it helps to improve performance and user experience by caching images locally. 

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using `cached_network_image_builder` in the following scenarios:

- **Image-heavy Applications**: If your app displays a lot of images, such as in galleries or social media feeds, caching can significantly reduce loading times and data usage.
- **Slow Network Conditions**: In areas with poor connectivity, cached images can provide a smoother experience by displaying previously loaded images instantly.
- **Dynamic Content**: For applications that frequently update images, caching ensures that users see the latest images without excessive loading times.

## Features

- **Automatic Caching**: The package automatically caches images, reducing the need for manual cache management.
- **Placeholder and Error Widgets**: You can easily specify placeholder images while the main image is loading and error widgets if the image fails to load.
- **Customizable Cache Management**: The package allows for customization of cache behavior, including cache expiration and size limits.

Overall, `cached_network_image_builder` is an essential package for any Flutter developer looking to enhance their app's image loading capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Cached Network Image Builder

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `cached_network_image_builder` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `cached_network_image_builder` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cached_network_image_builder: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add App Transport Security settings if you are loading images from non-secure HTTP sources. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using Cached Network Image Builder

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `CachedNetworkImageBuilder` in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:cached_network_image_builder/cached_network_image_builder.dart';
```

2. Use the `CachedNetworkImageBuilder` widget in your widget tree:

```dart
CachedNetworkImageBuilder(
  image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image.jpg'),
  placeholder: (context, url) => CircularProgressIndicator(),
  errorWidget: (context, url, error) => Icon(Icons.error),
)
```

This widget will automatically handle image loading, caching, and displaying placeholders or error icons as needed.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `cached_network_image_builder` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Cached Network Image Builder

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cached_network_image_builder/cached_network_image_builder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cached Network Image Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Cached Network Image Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CachedNetworkImageBuilder(
            // Specify the image to load from the network
            image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image.jpg'),
            // Placeholder while the image is loading
            placeholder: (context, url) => CircularProgressIndicator(),
            // Widget to display if the image fails to load
            errorWidget: (context, url, error) => Icon(Icons.error),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Cached Network Image Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a CachedNetworkImageBuilder widget.
// 5. The CachedNetworkImageBuilder attempts to load an image from the specified URL.
// 6. While the image is loading, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed as a placeholder.
// 7. If the image fails to load, an error icon is shown instead.
// 8. This setup provides a smooth user experience by caching images and handling loading states effectively.
