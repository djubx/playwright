# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `reactive_color_picker`

## Installation
To get started with the `reactive_color_picker` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  reactive_color_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/reactive_color_picker).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `reactive_color_picker`, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:reactive_color_picker/reactive_color_picker.dart';
```

You can then create a simple color picker widget in your Flutter app. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reactive_color_picker/reactive_color_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Reactive Color Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ReactiveColorPicker(
            onColorChanged: (color) {
              // Handle color change
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a color picker in the center of the screen. The `onColorChanged` callback allows you to handle the color selection.

# Complete Example of `reactive_color_picker`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reactive_color_picker/reactive_color_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Reactive Color Picker Demo',
      home: ColorPickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ColorPickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ColorPickerScreenState createState() => _ColorPickerScreenState();
}

class _ColorPickerScreenState extends State<ColorPickerScreen> {
  Color selectedColor = Colors.blue; // Default color

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Color Picker'),
        backgroundColor: selectedColor, // Change app bar color based on selected color
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the currently selected color
            Container(
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              color: selectedColor,
              child: Center(child: Text('Selected Color')),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Reactive color picker widget
            ReactiveColorPicker(
              initialColor: selectedColor,
              onColorChanged: (color) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedColor = color; // Update the selected color
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and directs to ColorPickerScreen.
// 3. ColorPickerScreen maintains the state of the selected color.
// 4. The app bar color changes dynamically based on the selected color.
// 5. The color picker allows users to select a color, which updates the state.
// 6. The selected color is displayed in a container, providing visual feedback.
