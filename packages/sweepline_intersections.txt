# Overview of the `sweepline_intersections` Flutter Package

The `sweepline_intersections` package is a powerful tool for developers working with geometric algorithms in Flutter applications. It provides an efficient way to compute intersections between line segments using the sweep line algorithm, which is particularly useful in applications involving graphics, mapping, and computational geometry.

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the `sweepline_intersections` package in scenarios such as:
- **Graphic Design Applications**: Where you need to detect overlapping shapes or paths.
- **Mapping Applications**: For calculating intersections of routes or geographical features.
- **Game Development**: To manage collision detection between moving objects.

## Key Features
- **Efficient Intersection Detection**: Utilizes the sweep line algorithm for optimal performance.
- **Support for Multiple Line Segments**: Can handle a large number of line segments efficiently.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter projects.

Overall, the `sweepline_intersections` package is an essential tool for developers needing robust geometric computations in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `sweepline_intersections`

## Installation
To add the `sweepline_intersections` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sweepline_intersections: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `sweepline_intersections` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional platform-specific configurations required for basic usage. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:sweepline_intersections/sweepline_intersections.dart';
```

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the package to find intersections between line segments:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create a list of line segments
  List<LineSegment> segments = [
    LineSegment(Point(0, 0), Point(5, 5)),
    LineSegment(Point(0, 5), Point(5, 0)),
    LineSegment(Point(1, 1), Point(4, 4)),
  ];

  // Find intersections
  List<Point> intersections = findIntersections(segments);

  // Print the intersection points
  for (var point in intersections) {
    print('Intersection at: (${point.x}, ${point.y})');
  }
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create line segments and find their intersection points using the `sweepline_intersections` package.

# Complete Example of `sweepline_intersections`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sweepline_intersections/sweepline_intersections.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sweep Line Intersections Demo',
      home: IntersectionDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class IntersectionDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a list of line segments
    List<LineSegment> segments = [
      LineSegment(Point(50, 50), Point(200, 200)),
      LineSegment(Point(50, 200), Point(200, 50)),
      LineSegment(Point(100, 100), Point(150, 150)),
    ];

    // Find intersections
    List<Point> intersections = findIntersections(segments);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sweep Line Intersections'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Intersections:'),
            for (var point in intersections)
              Text('(${point.x}, ${point.y})'), // Display intersection points
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (IntersectionDemo).
// 3. The IntersectionDemo widget creates a list of line segments using the LineSegment class.
// 4. It then calls the findIntersections function to calculate the intersection points of the segments.
// 5. The results are displayed in a column, showing each intersection point on the screen.
