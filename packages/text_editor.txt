# Tutorial: Setting Up the Text Editor Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **text_editor** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the **text_editor** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  text_editor: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/text_editor).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest version
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.3.1' // or latest version
    ...
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # or latest version
```

## Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:text_editor/text_editor.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage
You can now use the `TextEditor` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
TextEditor(
  controller: TextEditorController(),
  toolbarOptions: [
    ToolbarOption.bold,
    ToolbarOption.italic,
    ToolbarOption.underline,
    ToolbarOption.image,
  ],
)
```

This code snippet creates a basic text editor with options for bold, italic, underline, and image insertion.

## Step 5: Customization
You can customize the text editor further by modifying the toolbar options and styles according to your application's needs.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the **text_editor** package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Text Editor in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_editor/text_editor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Text Editor Example',
      home: TextEditorPage(),
    );
  }
}

class TextEditorPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TextEditorPageState createState() => _TextEditorPageState();
}

class _TextEditorPageState extends State<TextEditorPage> {
  // Create a controller for the text editor
  final TextEditorController _controller = TextEditorController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Text Editor Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Text Editor Widget
          Expanded(
            child: TextEditor(
              controller: _controller,
              toolbarOptions: [
                ToolbarOption.bold,
                ToolbarOption.italic,
                ToolbarOption.underline,
                ToolbarOption.image,
              ],
            ),
          ),
          // Save Button
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Handle save action
                String content = _controller.getText(); // Get the text content
                print('Saved content: $content'); // Print the content to console
              },
              child: Text('Save'),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets TextEditorPage as the home widget.
// 3. TextEditorPage is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the text editor.
// 4. A TextEditorController is created to manage the text editor's content.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Column containing the TextEditor and a Save button.
// 6. The TextEditor widget is configured with the controller and toolbar options for text formatting.
// 7. When the Save button is pressed, the current text content is retrieved from the controller and printed to the console.
