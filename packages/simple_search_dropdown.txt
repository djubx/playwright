# Tutorial: Setting Up Simple Search Dropdown

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **simple_search_dropdown** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **simple_search_dropdown** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_search_dropdown: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the dropdown, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:simple_search_dropdown/simple_search_dropdown.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Simple Search Dropdown

You can now use the `SimpleSearchDropdown` widget in your application. Below is an example of how to implement it in a basic Flutter app.

# Complete Example of Simple Search Dropdown

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_search_dropdown/simple_search_dropdown.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Search Dropdown Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Simple Search Dropdown Example'),
        ),
        body: SearchDropdownExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SearchDropdownExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SearchDropdownExampleState createState() => _SearchDropdownExampleState();
}

class _SearchDropdownExampleState extends State<SearchDropdownExample> {
  // List of items to display in the dropdown
  final List<String> items = [
    'Apple',
    'Banana',
    'Cherry',
    'Date',
    'Elderberry',
    'Fig',
    'Grape',
    'Honeydew',
  ];

  // Variable to hold the selected item
  String? selectedItem;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          // SimpleSearchDropdown widget
          SimpleSearchDropdown<String>(
            items: items, // Pass the list of items
            label: 'Select a fruit', // Label for the dropdown
            onChanged: (value) {
              setState(() {
                selectedItem = value; // Update the selected item
              });
            },
            selectedItem: selectedItem, // Pass the selected item
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Display the selected item
          Text(
            selectedItem != null ? 'Selected: $selectedItem' : 'No item selected',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 3. The SearchDropdownExample widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. Inside SearchDropdownExample, a list of items is defined.
// 5. The SimpleSearchDropdown widget is used to create a searchable dropdown.
// 6. When an item is selected, the onChanged callback updates the selectedItem state.
// 7. The selected item is displayed below the dropdown.
```

// The application starts with the main function, which initializes the RealFlutter app. 
// The RealFlutter widget sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the SearchDropdownExample widget.
// The SearchDropdownExample widget maintains a list of items and a variable to hold the selected item.
// The SimpleSearchDropdown widget is used to create a dropdown that allows users to search through the list of fruits.
// When a user selects an item, the onChanged callback updates the selectedItem variable, and the selected item is displayed below the dropdown.
// This flow provides a seamless user experience for selecting items from a searchable dropdown.
