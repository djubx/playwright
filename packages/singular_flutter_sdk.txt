# Setting Up the singular_flutter_sdk Package

To get started with the `singular_flutter_sdk`, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     singular_flutter_sdk: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/singular_flutter_sdk).

2. **Run Flutter Packages Get**: After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <application>
       <meta-data
           android:name="singular.apiKey"
           android:value="YOUR_SINGULAR_API_KEY"/>
   </application>
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_SINGULAR_API_KEY` with your actual Singular API key.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   <key>singular.apiKey</key>
   <string>YOUR_SINGULAR_API_KEY</string>
   ```

   Again, replace `YOUR_SINGULAR_API_KEY` with your actual Singular API key.

## Initialization

In your main application file, initialize the Singular SDK as follows:

```dart
import 'package:singular_flutter_sdk/singular_flutter_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  Singular.init("YOUR_SINGULAR_API_KEY");
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This setup ensures that the Singular SDK is ready to track events and user interactions as soon as your app starts.

Now you are ready to use the `singular_flutter_sdk` in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using singular_flutter_sdk

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:singular_flutter_sdk/singular_flutter_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  // Ensure Flutter bindings are initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize the Singular SDK with your API key
  Singular.init("YOUR_SINGULAR_API_KEY");
  
  // Run the main application
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Singular SDK Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Singular SDK Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Log a custom event when the button is pressed
            Singular.event("button_clicked", {
              "button_name": "example_button",
              "timestamp": DateTime.now().toString(),
            });
            // Show a confirmation message
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Event Logged!')),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Log Event'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing the Singular SDK.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 4. The HomeScreen contains a button that, when pressed, logs a custom event to Singular.
// 5. The event includes a name and additional parameters, such as the button name and timestamp.
// 6. A SnackBar is shown to confirm that the event has been logged successfully.
