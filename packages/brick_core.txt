# Overview of the `brick_core` Flutter Package

The `brick_core` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to streamline their data management and API interactions. It provides a robust framework for building data models and managing state, making it easier to work with complex data structures and APIs.

## When to Use `brick_core`

You should consider using `brick_core` when:
- You need to manage complex data models in your Flutter application.
- You want to simplify API interactions and data serialization.
- You are looking for a way to implement a clean architecture in your Flutter projects.

## Key Features

- **Data Modeling**: Easily define data models with built-in serialization and deserialization capabilities.
- **API Integration**: Simplifies the process of making API calls and handling responses.
- **State Management**: Provides tools for managing application state effectively.
- **Customizable**: Highly customizable to fit various project requirements.

Overall, `brick_core` is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with efficient data handling and state management capabilities.

# Setting Up and Using `brick_core`

## Installation

To add `brick_core` to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  brick_core: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/brick_core).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow network requests if you are making API calls. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

To use `brick_core`, you will typically start by defining your data models. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a model and use it within your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:brick_core/brick_core.dart';

class User extends BrickModel {
  final String id;
  final String name;

  User({required this.id, required this.name});

  // Serialization and deserialization methods
  factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return User(
      id: json['id'],
      name: json['name'],
    );
  }

  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() {
    return {
      'id': id,
      'name': name,
    };
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a simple `User` model with serialization capabilities. You can then use this model to manage user data in your application.

# Complete Example of Using `brick_core`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:brick_core/brick_core.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Brick Core Example',
      home: UserListScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class UserListScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _UserListScreenState createState() => _UserListScreenState();
}

class _UserListScreenState extends State<UserListScreen> {
  List<User> users = []; // List to hold user data

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    fetchUsers(); // Fetch users when the screen initializes
  }

  // Function to fetch users from an API
  Future<void> fetchUsers() async {
    // Simulating an API call
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
    // Mock data
    setState(() {
      users = [
        User(id: '1', name: 'Alice'),
        User(id: '2', name: 'Bob'),
      ];
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('User List'),
      ),
      body: users.isEmpty
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: users.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(users[index].name), // Display user name
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. UserListScreen is a stateful widget that manages a list of users.
// 4. In initState, fetchUsers is called to simulate fetching user data.
// 5. fetchUsers simulates an API call with a delay and updates the users list.
// 6. The build method displays a loading indicator while users are being fetched.
// 7. Once the users are fetched, a ListView displays the user names.
