# Steps Indicator Flutter Package

The **steps_indicator** Flutter package is a versatile widget that allows developers to create a visually appealing step indicator for multi-step processes. This package is particularly useful in scenarios such as onboarding flows, form submissions, or any process that requires users to complete a series of steps. 

## Features
- **Customizable Steps**: You can easily customize the number of steps, their labels, and the current step.
- **Flexible Design**: The package supports various designs, including horizontal and vertical orientations, allowing for integration into different UI layouts.
- **Animations**: Smooth animations enhance user experience, making transitions between steps visually engaging.
- **Accessibility**: The package is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that all users can navigate through the steps easily.

## When to Use

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Steps Indicator

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **steps_indicator** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  steps_indicator: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:steps_indicator/steps_indicator.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
You can now use the `StepsIndicator` widget in your application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
StepsIndicator(
  selectedStep: 1, // Current step index (0-based)
  nbSteps: 4, // Total number of steps
  lineLength: 30, // Length of the line connecting steps
  selectedStepSize: 20, // Size of the selected step
  unselectedStepSize: 20, // Size of unselected steps
  selectedStepColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the selected step
  unselectedStepColor: Colors.grey, // Color of unselected steps
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customization
You can customize the appearance of the step indicator by modifying properties such as `lineLength`, `selectedStepColor`, and `unselectedStepColor`. This allows you to match the step indicator with your app's theme.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the **steps_indicator** package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Steps Indicator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:steps_indicator/steps_indicator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Steps Indicator Example',
      home: StepsIndicatorDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class StepsIndicatorDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StepsIndicatorDemoState createState() => _StepsIndicatorDemoState();
}

class _StepsIndicatorDemoState extends State<StepsIndicatorDemo> {
  int currentStep = 0; // Track the current step

  // List of steps
  final List<String> steps = [
    "Step 1: Start",
    "Step 2: Details",
    "Step 3: Review",
    "Step 4: Complete"
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Steps Indicator Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          // Display the steps indicator
          StepsIndicator(
            selectedStep: currentStep,
            nbSteps: steps.length,
            lineLength: 30,
            selectedStepSize: 20,
            unselectedStepSize: 20,
            selectedStepColor: Colors.blue,
            unselectedStepColor: Colors.grey,
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Display the current step description
          Text(
            steps[currentStep],
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Buttons to navigate through steps
          Row(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
            children: [
              // Previous button
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: currentStep > 0
                    ? () {
                        setState(() {
                          currentStep--; // Decrease the step
                        });
                      }
                    : null,
                child: Text('Previous'),
              ),
              // Next button
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: currentStep < steps.length - 1
                    ? () {
                        setState(() {
                          currentStep++; // Increase the step
                        });
                      }
                    : null,
                child: Text('Next'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The StepsIndicatorDemo widget is the main screen, displaying the step indicator and current step description.
// 3. The currentStep variable tracks which step is currently selected.
// 4. The StepsIndicator widget visually represents the steps, with the selected step highlighted.
// 5. The Text widget displays the description of the current step.
// 6. Two buttons allow users to navigate between steps, updating the currentStep variable and rebuilding the UI accordingly.
