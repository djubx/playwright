          speed: 50,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          // Step 1: The TypewriterText widget is used to create a typing effect.
          // Step 2: The speed property is used to adjust the speed of the typing effect.
          // Step 3: The style property is used to customize the style of the text.
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and the MyApp widget is built.
// 2. The MyApp widget builds the MaterialApp and sets the title and theme.
// 3. The MaterialApp builds the MyHomePage widget.
// 4. The MyHomePage widget builds the Scaffold and sets the appBar and body.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains the TypewriterText widget.
// 6. The TypewriterText widget creates a typing effect on the text 'Hello, World!'.
// 7. The speed of the typing effect is set to 50.
// 8. The style of the text is set to a fontSize of 24.

In summary, the code flows as follows: The user runs the app, which builds the `MyApp` widget. The `MyApp` widget builds the `MaterialApp`, which sets the title and theme. The `MaterialApp` builds the `MyHomePage` widget, which sets the appBar and body of the Scaffold. The body contains the `TypewriterText` widget, which creates a typing effect on the text 'Hello, World!' with a speed of 50 and a fontSize of 24.
