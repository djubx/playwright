# Flutter Keyboard Size Package

The `flutter_keyboard_size` package is a useful tool for Flutter developers who want to manage keyboard visibility and its impact on the UI. This package helps in determining the size of the keyboard when it appears, allowing developers to adjust their layouts accordingly. 

## When to Use This Package

You might want to use the `flutter_keyboard_size` package in scenarios such as:
- **Form Inputs**: When building forms, you want to ensure that the input fields are not obscured by the keyboard.
- **Chat Applications**: In chat apps, the keyboard can cover the message input area, so adjusting the UI dynamically is essential.
- **Custom Layouts**: If your app has a custom layout that needs to adapt when the keyboard appears, this package can help manage those changes.

## Features

- **Keyboard Size Detection**: Automatically detects the size of the keyboard when it appears or disappears.
- **Responsive UI**: Adjusts the UI based on the keyboard's visibility, ensuring a smooth user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_keyboard_size

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_keyboard_size` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_keyboard_size` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_keyboard_size: ^0.5.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the following configuration to allow the keyboard to resize the activity:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
</activity>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you typically do not need to make any special configurations, as the keyboard behavior is handled by default. However, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to a version that supports the necessary features.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_keyboard_size/flutter_keyboard_size.dart';
```

2. Wrap your main widget with `KeyboardSizeProvider` to enable keyboard size detection:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(KeyboardSizeProvider(
    child: MyApp(),
  ));
}
```

3. Use the `KeyboardSize` widget to adjust your layout based on the keyboard size:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Keyboard Size Example')),
        body: KeyboardSize(
          child: MyForm(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyForm extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          TextField(),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {},
            child: Text('Submit'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

With these steps, you can effectively manage keyboard visibility and adjust your UI accordingly.

# Complete Example of flutter_keyboard_size

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_keyboard_size/flutter_keyboard_size.dart';

void main() {
  // Wrapping the app with KeyboardSizeProvider to enable keyboard size detection
  runApp(KeyboardSizeProvider(
    child: RealFlutterApp(),
  ));
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Keyboard Size Example')),
        body: KeyboardSize(
          // The KeyboardSize widget adjusts its child based on the keyboard size
          child: MyForm(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyForm extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Column(
        // Using a Column to stack the TextField and Button
        children: [
          TextField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Enter your text',
              border: OutlineInputBorder(),
            ),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between the TextField and Button
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Submit'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the KeyboardSizeProvider.
// 2. The RealFlutterApp is created, which sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, the KeyboardSize widget is used to wrap the MyForm widget.
// 4. The MyForm widget contains a TextField for user input and a Submit button.
// 5. When the button is pressed, a SnackBar is displayed to confirm the action.
// 6. The KeyboardSize package automatically adjusts the layout when the keyboard appears or disappears, ensuring that the TextField is always visible.
