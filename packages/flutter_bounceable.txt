# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_bounceable`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_bounceable` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_bounceable: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_bounceable/flutter_bounceable.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Bounceable Widgets

You can use the `Bounceable` widget to wrap any widget you want to animate. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
Bounceable(
  onTap: () {
    // Action to perform on tap
  },
  child: Container(
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    color: Colors.blue,
    child: Center(child: Text('Tap Me')),
  ),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS
For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing the Bounce Effect

You can customize the bounce effect by adjusting the `duration` and `scale` properties:

```dart
Bounceable(
  onTap: () {
    // Action to perform on tap
  },
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 200),
  scale: 1.2, // Scale factor for the bounce effect
  child: Container(
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    color: Colors.red,
    child: Center(child: Text('Bounce Me')),
  ),
)
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate and customize the `flutter_bounceable` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_bounceable`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bounceable/flutter_bounceable.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bounceable Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bounceable Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Bounceable(
            onTap: () {
              // Action to perform on tap
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Button Tapped!')),
              );
            },
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 200), // Duration of the bounce
            scale: 1.2, // Scale factor for the bounce effect
            child: Container(
              width: 150,
              height: 150,
              color: Colors.green,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Tap Me!',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Bounceable widget wraps a Container.
// 5. The Bounceable widget has an onTap callback that shows a SnackBar when tapped.
// 6. The Container has a green background and displays the text 'Tap Me!'.
// 7. When the user taps the container, it bounces and the SnackBar appears, providing feedback.
