# Stack Board Flutter Package

The **stack_board** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to create stack-based layouts in Flutter applications. It allows developers to easily manage and display multiple widgets in a stack format, providing a flexible and dynamic user interface. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to overlay widgets, such as in card layouts, image galleries, or custom navigation stacks.

## When to Use Stack Board

You might consider using the **stack_board** package in the following scenarios:

- **Overlaying Widgets**: When you need to display one widget on top of another, such as a button over an image.
- **Dynamic Layouts**: For applications that require a responsive design where widgets can change based on user interaction or data.
- **Custom Navigation**: When implementing custom navigation stacks that require a layered approach.

## Features

- **Flexible Layout**: Easily stack multiple widgets with customizable alignment and positioning.
- **Animation Support**: Integrate animations to enhance user experience when transitioning between stacked widgets.
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adjust the layout based on screen size and orientation.

Overall, the **stack_board** package simplifies the process of creating complex layouts in Flutter, making it an essential tool for developers looking to enhance their applications' UI.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Stack Board

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **stack_board** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stack_board: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:stack_board/stack_board.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Stack Board

You can now use the **stack_board** package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a stack layout using the `RealFlutter` class.

# Complete Example of Stack Board

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stack_board/stack_board.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Stack Board Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Stack Board Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: StackBoard(
            // The StackBoard widget allows for stacking multiple children
            children: [
              // First widget in the stack
              Container(
                width: 300,
                height: 200,
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Center(child: Text('Background', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
              ),
              // Second widget in the stack
              Positioned(
                top: 20,
                left: 20,
                child: Container(
                  width: 250,
                  height: 150,
                  color: Colors.red,
                  child: Center(child: Text('Overlay', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
                ),
              ),
              // Third widget in the stack
              Positioned(
                bottom: 10,
                right: 10,
                child: ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Action when button is pressed
                    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')));
                  },
                  child: Text('Press Me'),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the StackBoard.
// 4. The StackBoard widget contains three children:
//    - A blue container that serves as the background.
//    - A red container positioned on top of the blue one, creating an overlay effect.
//    - An ElevatedButton positioned at the bottom right corner, which shows a SnackBar when pressed.
// 5. The layout is responsive, and the stack allows for easy management of overlapping widgets.
