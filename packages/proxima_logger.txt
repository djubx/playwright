# Proxima Logger: A Comprehensive Overview

The **proxima_logger** package is a powerful logging utility for Flutter applications, designed to simplify the process of logging messages and errors in a structured and efficient manner. It provides developers with a flexible and easy-to-use interface for logging, making it an essential tool for debugging and monitoring applications.

## When to Use Proxima Logger
- **Debugging**: When you need to track down issues in your application, logging can provide insights into the application's behavior.
- **Monitoring**: For production applications, logging can help monitor the application's performance and catch errors before they affect users.
- **Analytics**: You can log user interactions and events to gather analytics data.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Log Levels**: Supports various log levels (e.g., debug, info, warning, error) to categorize log messages.
- **File Logging**: Ability to log messages to a file for persistent storage.
- **Console Output**: Logs can be printed to the console for real-time debugging.
- **Structured Logging**: Supports structured logging, allowing you to log complex objects easily.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, **proxima_logger** is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their logging capabilities in Flutter applications.

# Proxima Logger: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To add the **proxima_logger** package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  proxima_logger: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/proxima_logger).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow file access if you plan to log to a file. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSDocumentsDirectoryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the documents directory for logging purposes.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the **proxima_logger** package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:proxima_logger/proxima_logger.dart';
```

You can create an instance of the logger and start logging messages:

```dart
void main() {
  final logger = ProximaLogger();

  logger.debug('This is a debug message');
  logger.info('This is an info message');
  logger.warning('This is a warning message');
  logger.error('This is an error message');
}
```

This basic setup allows you to log messages at different levels, which can be very useful during development and debugging.

# Proxima Logger: Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:proxima_logger/proxima_logger.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create an instance of the logger
  final ProximaLogger logger = ProximaLogger();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Log an info message when the app starts
    logger.info('Application started');

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Proxima Logger Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Proxima Logger Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log a debug message when the button is pressed
              logger.debug('Button pressed');
              // Simulate an error for demonstration
              try {
                throw Exception('Simulated error');
              } catch (e) {
                // Log the error message
                logger.error('An error occurred: $e');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. Inside the RealFlutter widget, an instance of ProximaLogger is created.
// 3. When the app starts, an info message is logged indicating that the application has started.
// 4. The app displays a button in the center of the screen.
// 5. When the button is pressed, a debug message is logged.
// 6. An exception is simulated, and when caught, an error message is logged with the exception details.
// 7. This demonstrates how to log different types of messages and handle errors effectively.
