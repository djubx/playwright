# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the flutter_internet_speed_test Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_internet_speed_test` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_internet_speed_test: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the speed test functionality.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_internet_speed_test/flutter_internet_speed_test.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final InternetSpeedTest _internetSpeedTest = InternetSpeedTest();
  String _downloadSpeed = '';
  String _uploadSpeed = '';
  String _ping = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _startSpeedTest();
  }

  void _startSpeedTest() {
    _internetSpeedTest.startTesting(
      'http://ipv4.download.thinkbroadband.com/10MB.zip', // Test file URL
      (double downloadPercentage) {
        // Update download percentage
      },
      (double uploadPercentage) {
        // Update upload percentage
      },
      (String downloadSpeed, String uploadSpeed, String ping) {
        setState(() {
          _downloadSpeed = downloadSpeed;
          _uploadSpeed = uploadSpeed;
          _ping = ping;
        });
      },
      (String errorMessage) {
        // Handle error
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Internet Speed Test')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Download Speed: $_downloadSpeed'),
            Text('Upload Speed: $_uploadSpeed'),
            Text('Ping: $_ping'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of flutter_internet_speed_test

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_internet_speed_test/flutter_internet_speed_test.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of the InternetSpeedTest class
  final InternetSpeedTest _internetSpeedTest = InternetSpeedTest();
  String _downloadSpeed = ''; // Variable to hold download speed
  String _uploadSpeed = ''; // Variable to hold upload speed
  String _ping = ''; // Variable to hold ping time

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _startSpeedTest(); // Start the speed test when the widget is initialized
  }

  void _startSpeedTest() {
    // Start testing with a specific file URL
    _internetSpeedTest.startTesting(
      'http://ipv4.download.thinkbroadband.com/10MB.zip', // URL for testing download speed
      (double downloadPercentage) {
        // This callback is called during the download process
        // You can use this to show progress if needed
      },
      (double uploadPercentage) {
        // This callback is called during the upload process
        // You can use this to show progress if needed
      },
      (String downloadSpeed, String uploadSpeed, String ping) {
        // This callback is called when the test is complete
        setState(() {
          _downloadSpeed = downloadSpeed; // Update the download speed
          _uploadSpeed = uploadSpeed; // Update the upload speed
          _ping = ping; // Update the ping time
        });
      },
      (String errorMessage) {
        // Handle any errors that occur during the test
        print('Error: $errorMessage');
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Internet Speed Test')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the download speed
            Text('Download Speed: $_downloadSpeed'),
            // Display the upload speed
            Text('Upload Speed: $_uploadSpeed'),
            // Display the ping time
            Text('Ping: $_ping'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. In the initState method, the _startSpeedTest function is called to initiate the speed test.
// 3. The startTesting method of the InternetSpeedTest class is called with a URL to test the download speed.
// 4. As the test progresses, the download and upload percentages can be tracked (not displayed in this example).
// 5. Once the test is complete, the download speed, upload speed, and ping time are updated in the state.
// 6. The UI is rebuilt to display the results of the speed test.
