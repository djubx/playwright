# Device Preview Plus: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `device_preview_plus` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `device_preview_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  device_preview_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/device_preview_plus).

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:device_preview_plus/device_preview.dart';
```

## Step 3: Wrapping Your App

You need to wrap your main application widget with `DevicePreview`. This allows the package to intercept the app's build process and provide the device preview functionality.

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    DevicePreview(
      enabled: !kReleaseMode, // Enable only in debug mode
      builder: (context) => MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Step 4: Configuring Device Preview

You can customize the device preview settings by using the `DevicePreview` widget's properties. For example, you can set the initial device, orientation, and more.

```dart
DevicePreview(
  enabled: !kReleaseMode,
  builder: (context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      builder: DevicePreview.appBuilder,
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  },
),
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations. Typically, no additional setup is required for `device_preview_plus`.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set correctly in your `ios/Podfile`. The package should work seamlessly without additional configurations.

## Step 5: Running Your App

Now, you can run your app using `flutter run`. You will see a device preview panel on the left side of your application, allowing you to select different devices and orientations.

With these steps, you are now set up to use the `device_preview_plus` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Device Preview Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:device_preview_plus/device_preview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    DevicePreview(
      enabled: !kReleaseMode, // Enable device preview only in debug mode
      builder: (context) => MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      builder: DevicePreview.appBuilder, // Use the app builder from device preview
      title: 'Device Preview Plus Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Device Preview Plus Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Hello, Device Preview!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and wraps it with DevicePreview.
// 2. DevicePreview is enabled only in debug mode to avoid unnecessary overhead in release builds.
// 3. MyApp is the main application widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 4. The MaterialApp uses DevicePreview.appBuilder to integrate device preview functionality.
// 5. MyHomePage is the home screen of the app, displaying a simple greeting message.
// 6. The app can be run, and the device preview panel will allow switching between different devices and orientations.
