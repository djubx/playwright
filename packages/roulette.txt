Here's a detailed technical blog on the "roulette" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Roulette Flutter Package

The **roulette** Flutter package is a versatile and engaging tool designed for creating roulette-style games and animations within Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to implement game mechanics similar to those found in casinos or for educational purposes, such as teaching probability and statistics.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the roulette package in scenarios such as:
- Developing a casino-themed mobile application.
- Creating educational games that involve chance and probability.
- Implementing a fun feature in an app that allows users to spin a wheel for prizes or decisions.

## Features

- **Customizable Wheel**: The package allows you to customize the appearance of the roulette wheel, including colors, labels, and the number of segments.
- **Animation Support**: It provides smooth animations for spinning the wheel, enhancing user experience.
- **Event Handling**: You can easily handle events when the wheel stops, allowing for interactive gameplay.
- **Integration**: The package can be integrated seamlessly into existing Flutter applications.

Overall, the roulette package is a powerful tool for developers looking to add engaging and interactive elements to their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Roulette Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the roulette package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the roulette package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  roulette: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Roulette Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple roulette wheel in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:roulette/roulette.dart';
```

2. Create a basic Flutter app structure and implement the roulette wheel.

# Complete Example: Implementing the Roulette Wheel

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:roulette/roulette.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Roulette Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RoulettePage(),
    );
  }
}

class RoulettePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RoulettePageState createState() => _RoulettePageState();
}

class _RoulettePageState extends State<RoulettePage> {
  // Initialize the roulette wheel with segments
  final List<String> segments = ['Red', 'Black', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Yellow'];
  late RouletteController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Create a RouletteController to manage the wheel
    _controller = RouletteController();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Roulette Wheel'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the roulette wheel
            Roulette(
              controller: _controller,
              segments: segments,
              onSpinEnd: (String result) {
                // Handle the result when the wheel stops
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Result: $result')),
                );
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Start spinning the wheel
                _controller.spin();
              },
              child: Text('Spin the Wheel'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets RoulettePage as the home screen.
// 3. RoulettePage is a StatefulWidget that manages the roulette wheel state.
// 4. In the initState method, we create a RouletteController to control the wheel.
// 5. The build method constructs the UI, including the roulette wheel and a button to spin it.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the spin method of the controller is called, starting the wheel spin.
// 7. Once the wheel stops, the onSpinEnd callback is triggered, displaying the result in a SnackBar.
```
