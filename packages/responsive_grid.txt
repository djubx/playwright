# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Responsive Grid Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `responsive_grid` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  responsive_grid: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `responsive_grid` package:

```dart
import 'package:responsive_grid/responsive_grid.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Responsive Grid

You can now use the `ResponsiveGrid` widget in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a responsive grid layout.

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
  
  ```gradle
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`.

### Example Usage

You can create a responsive grid layout as follows:

```dart
ResponsiveGridRow(
  children: [
    ResponsiveGridCol(
      xs: 6, // 6 columns on extra small screens
      md: 4, // 4 columns on medium screens
      child: Container(color: Colors.red, height: 100),
    ),
    ResponsiveGridCol(
      xs: 6,
      md: 4,
      child: Container(color: Colors.green, height: 100),
    ),
    ResponsiveGridCol(
      xs: 6,
      md: 4,
      child: Container(color: Colors.blue, height: 100),
    ),
  ],
)
```

This code creates a responsive grid with three columns that adjust based on the screen size.

# Complete Example of Responsive Grid in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_grid/responsive_grid.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Responsive Grid Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Responsive Grid Example'),
        ),
        body: ResponsiveGridRow(
          children: [
            // First column: takes 6 columns on extra small screens and 4 on medium screens
            ResponsiveGridCol(
              xs: 6,
              md: 4,
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.red,
                height: 100,
                child: Center(child: Text('Column 1')),
              ),
            ),
            // Second column: same as the first
            ResponsiveGridCol(
              xs: 6,
              md: 4,
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.green,
                height: 100,
                child: Center(child: Text('Column 2')),
              ),
            ),
            // Third column: same as the first
            ResponsiveGridCol(
              xs: 6,
              md: 4,
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.blue,
                height: 100,
                child: Center(child: Text('Column 3')),
              ),
            ),
            // Fourth column: same as the first
            ResponsiveGridCol(
              xs: 6,
              md: 4,
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.yellow,
                height: 100,
                child: Center(child: Text('Column 4')),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body uses ResponsiveGridRow to create a responsive grid layout.
// 5. Each ResponsiveGridCol defines how many columns it should take on different screen sizes.
// 6. The containers inside each column are colored and contain centered text.
// 7. As the screen size changes, the number of columns displayed will adjust accordingly.
```
