# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Authentication Buttons Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `authentication_buttons` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  authentication_buttons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure you have the required configurations for social login SDKs if you are using them.

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:authentication_buttons/authentication_buttons.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Buttons

You can now use the authentication buttons in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
AuthenticationButton(
  buttonType: AuthenticationButtonType.google,
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle Google authentication
  },
),
```

This button will display a Google login button, and you can handle the authentication logic in the `onPressed` callback.

# Complete Example of Using Authentication Buttons

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:authentication_buttons/authentication_buttons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Authentication Buttons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Authentication Buttons Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Google Authentication Button
              AuthenticationButton(
                buttonType: AuthenticationButtonType.google,
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle Google authentication
                  print('Google button pressed');
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between buttons
              // Facebook Authentication Button
              AuthenticationButton(
                buttonType: AuthenticationButtonType.facebook,
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle Facebook authentication
                  print('Facebook button pressed');
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between buttons
              // Twitter Authentication Button
              AuthenticationButton(
                buttonType: AuthenticationButtonType.twitter,
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle Twitter authentication
                  print('Twitter button pressed');
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the authentication buttons vertically.
// 5. Each AuthenticationButton is created with a specific button type (Google, Facebook, Twitter).
// 6. The onPressed callback for each button is defined to handle the respective authentication logic.
// 7. When a button is pressed, a message is printed to the console indicating which button was pressed.
