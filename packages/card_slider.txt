# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Card Slider Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the **card_slider** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  card_slider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:card_slider/card_slider.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Card Slider
You can now use the `CardSlider` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
CardSlider(
  items: [
    CardItem(title: 'Item 1', description: 'Description 1'),
    CardItem(title: 'Item 2', description: 'Description 2'),
    CardItem(title: 'Item 3', description: 'Description 3'),
  ],
  onCardTap: (index) {
    // Handle card tap
  },
)
```

This will create a basic card slider with three items. You can customize the `CardItem` class to include images, buttons, or any other widgets.

# Complete Example of Card Slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:card_slider/card_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Card Slider Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Card Slider Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CardSlider(
            items: [
              CardItem(title: 'Item 1', description: 'Description 1'),
              CardItem(title: 'Item 2', description: 'Description 2'),
              CardItem(title: 'Item 3', description: 'Description 3'),
            ],
            onCardTap: (index) {
              // Handle card tap
              print('Tapped on card: $index');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Card Slider Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers the CardSlider widget.
// 5. The CardSlider is initialized with a list of CardItem objects, each having a title and description.
// 6. The onCardTap callback is defined to handle taps on the cards, printing the index of the tapped card to the console.
// 7. When the app runs, users can swipe through the cards, and tapping on a card will trigger the onCardTap function.
```
