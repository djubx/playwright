              // Displaying the first score bar

              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between score bars
              // Displaying the second score bar
              FlScoreBar(
                score: 50, // Current score
                maxScore: 100, // Maximum possible score
                barColor: Colors.green, // Color of the filled part
                backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color

              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'fl_score_bar Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, two FlScoreBar widgets are displayed, each representing a different score.
// 6. The first FlScoreBar shows a score of 75 out of 100, filled with blue color.
// 7. The second FlScoreBar shows a score of 50 out of 100, filled with green color.
// 8. Each score bar has a grey background and an animation duration of 1 second for a smooth transition.
