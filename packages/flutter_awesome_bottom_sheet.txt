# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_awesome_bottom_sheet

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_awesome_bottom_sheet` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_awesome_bottom_sheet` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_awesome_bottom_sheet: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter and the package:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a bottom sheet using the `flutter_awesome_bottom_sheet` package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_awesome_bottom_sheet/flutter_awesome_bottom_sheet.dart';
```

2. Create a function to show the bottom sheet:

```dart
void showAwesomeBottomSheet(BuildContext context) {
  AwesomeBottomSheet.show(
    context: context,
    title: 'Awesome Bottom Sheet',
    content: Column(
      mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
      children: [
        Text('This is an awesome bottom sheet!'),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.pop(context); // Close the bottom sheet
          },
          child: Text('Close'),
        ),
      ],
    ),
  );
}
```

3. Call this function from a button or any other widget in your app:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () => showAwesomeBottomSheet(context),
  child: Text('Show Bottom Sheet'),
),
```

With these steps, you can easily implement a customizable bottom sheet in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_awesome_bottom_sheet

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_awesome_bottom_sheet/flutter_awesome_bottom_sheet.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Awesome Bottom Sheet Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bottom Sheet Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () => showAwesomeBottomSheet(context), // Show the bottom sheet when pressed
            child: Text('Show Bottom Sheet'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to show the awesome bottom sheet
  void showAwesomeBottomSheet(BuildContext context) {
    AwesomeBottomSheet.show(
      context: context,
      title: 'Awesome Bottom Sheet', // Title of the bottom sheet
      content: Column(
        mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min, // Minimize the height of the column
        children: [
          Text('This is an awesome bottom sheet!'), // Content of the bottom sheet
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              Navigator.pop(context); // Close the bottom sheet when pressed
            },
            child: Text('Close'), // Button to close the bottom sheet
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the showAwesomeBottomSheet function is called.
// 5. The showAwesomeBottomSheet function displays the AwesomeBottomSheet with a title and content.
// 6. The content includes a text message and a button to close the bottom sheet.
// 7. Pressing the close button pops the bottom sheet off the navigation stack, returning to the main screen.
```
