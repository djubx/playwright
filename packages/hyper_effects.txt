# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Hyper Effects

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **hyper_effects** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hyper_effects: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using it:

```dart
import 'package:hyper_effects/hyper_effects.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Hyper Effects

You can now use the features of the **hyper_effects** package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a button with a hyper effect.

```dart
HyperButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Action to perform on button press
  },
  child: Text('Click Me'),
  effect: HyperEffect.bounce, // Applying a bounce effect
);
```

This button will now have a bounce effect when pressed, enhancing the user experience.

# Complete Example of Hyper Effects

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hyper_effects/hyper_effects.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Hyper Effects Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Hyper Effects Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: HyperButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the next screen
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Screen'),
          effect: HyperEffect.bounce, // Applying a bounce effect
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Second Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: HyperButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Go back to the previous screen
            Navigator.pop(context);
          },
          child: Text('Back to Home'),
          effect: HyperEffect.fade, // Applying a fade effect
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is set as the home of the app.
// 4. HomeScreen displays a button with a bounce effect. When pressed, it navigates to the SecondScreen.
// 5. The SecondScreen contains another button with a fade effect. Pressing this button returns the user to the HomeScreen.
// 6. The use of HyperButton allows for easy implementation of animations, enhancing the overall user experience.
