- **Flexible Usage**: Works with various widgets, including `Container`, `Text`, and `Image`.
- **Performance Optimized**: Designed to be lightweight and efficient, ensuring minimal impact on app performance.

With these features, the **fade_shimmer** package is an excellent choice for developers looking to improve the loading experience in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Fade Shimmer

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **fade_shimmer** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fade_shimmer: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:fade_shimmer/fade_shimmer.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Fade Shimmer

You can use the **fade_shimmer** widget in your application as a placeholder. Hereâ€™s how to implement it for both Android and iOS:

### Basic Usage Example

```dart
FadeShimmer(
  width: 100, // Width of the shimmer
  height: 20, // Height of the shimmer
  radius: 10, // Border radius for rounded corners
  highlightColor: Colors.white, // Color of the shimmer highlight
  baseColor: Colors.grey[300], // Base color of the shimmer
);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your app's minimum SDK version is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Step 4: Customizing the Shimmer Effect

You can customize the shimmer effect by adjusting the parameters:

```dart
FadeShimmer(
  width: 200,
  height: 30,
  radius: 15,
  highlightColor: Colors.blue,
  baseColor: Colors.blue[100],
  duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the shimmer animation
);
```

This customization allows you to match the shimmer effect with your app's theme and design.

# Complete Example of Fade Shimmer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fade_shimmer/fade_shimmer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fade Shimmer Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Fade Shimmer Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Displaying a shimmer effect for a text placeholder
              FadeShimmer(
                width: 200, // Width of the shimmer
                height: 20, // Height of the shimmer
                radius: 10, // Border radius for rounded corners
                highlightColor: Colors.white, // Color of the shimmer highlight
                baseColor: Colors.grey[300], // Base color of the shimmer
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
              // Displaying a shimmer effect for an image placeholder
              FadeShimmer(
                width: 100, // Width of the shimmer
                height: 100, // Height of the shimmer
                radius: 10, // Border radius for rounded corners
                highlightColor: Colors.white, // Color of the shimmer highlight
                baseColor: Colors.grey[300], // Base color of the shimmer
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the shimmer placeholders vertically.
// 5. Two FadeShimmer widgets are created: one for text and one for an image, demonstrating how to use the package.
// 6. The shimmer effect provides a visual cue while the actual content is loading, enhancing user experience.
