# Floating Overlay Flutter Package

The **floating_overlay** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to create floating overlays in your Flutter applications. This package allows developers to display widgets that can float above other content, providing a seamless user experience. It is particularly useful for creating tooltips, modals, or any UI element that needs to be displayed on top of existing content without disrupting the flow of the application.

## When to Use

You might consider using the **floating_overlay** package in scenarios such as:
- Displaying contextual help or tooltips that guide users through your app.
- Creating modals that need to overlay existing content without blocking the entire screen.
- Implementing notifications or alerts that require user attention without navigating away from the current screen.

## Features

- **Customizable Positioning**: Easily position your overlay anywhere on the screen.
- **Animation Support**: Add animations to your overlays for a more engaging user experience.
- **Dismissible Overlays**: Allow users to dismiss overlays with a simple tap or swipe.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, the **floating_overlay** package enhances the interactivity and usability of your Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Floating Overlay Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **floating_overlay** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  floating_overlay: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions if they are not already present:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your app's Info.plist file to allow overlays. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a floating overlay.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:floating_overlay/floating_overlay.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Floating Overlay Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the floating overlay when the button is pressed
              FloatingOverlay.show(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => Container(
                  padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
                  color: Colors.blue,
                  child: Text('This is a floating overlay!'),
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Overlay'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a floating overlay appears with a message. You can customize the overlay's appearance and behavior as needed.

        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the floating overlay when the button is pressed
              FloatingOverlay.show(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => Container(
                  padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
                  color: Colors.blue,
                  child: Text('This is a floating overlay!'),
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Overlay'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

```
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// Inside the Scaffold, there's an AppBar with the title 'Floating Overlay Example'.
// The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// The child is an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, triggers the FloatingOverlay.show method.
// This method displays a floating overlay with a blue background and a text message.
// The overlay can be customized further, and users can dismiss it by tapping outside of it.
