# Complete Example of flutter_linear_datepicker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_linear_datepicker/flutter_linear_datepicker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Linear DatePicker Example',
      home: DatePickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class DatePickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DatePickerScreenState createState() => _DatePickerScreenState();
}

class _DatePickerScreenState extends State<DatePickerScreen> {
  DateTime _selectedDate = DateTime.now(); // Variable to hold the selected date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Linear DatePicker Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the selected date
            Text(
              'Selected Date: ${_selectedDate.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0],
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Text style for the date
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between text and date picker
            // Linear Date Picker widget
            LinearDatePicker(
              initialDate: _selectedDate, // Set the initial date
              onDateChanged: (selectedDate) {
                setState(() {
                  _selectedDate = selectedDate; // Update the selected date
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The home of the app is DatePickerScreen, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In DatePickerScreen, we maintain the state of the selected date.
// 5. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the selected date and the LinearDatePicker.
// 6. When a user selects a date, the onDateChanged callback updates the state with the new date.
// 7. The UI rebuilds to reflect the newly selected date.
```
