# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the PasswordField Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `passwordfield` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  passwordfield: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include any necessary permissions, although the `passwordfield` package does not require specific permissions.

## Step 3: Using the PasswordField Widget

Now that you have set up the package, you can use the `PasswordField` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:passwordfield/passwordfield.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Password Field Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: PasswordField(
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Handle password input changes
            },
            onSubmitted: (value) {
              // Handle password submission
            },
            hintText: 'Enter your password',
            labelText: 'Password',
            errorText: 'Password is required',
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Import Statements**: Import the necessary Flutter and `passwordfield` packages.
- **RealFlutter Class**: This is the main widget of the application.
- **MaterialApp**: The root of the application, providing material design styling.
- **PasswordField Widget**: This is where the password input field is created. It includes properties for handling changes, submissions, and displaying hints and error messages.

With these steps, you can successfully integrate the `passwordfield` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the PasswordField Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:passwordfield/passwordfield.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Password Field Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: PasswordField(
            onChanged: (value) {
              // This callback is triggered when the password input changes.
              // You can use this to update the state or validate the input.
            },
            onSubmitted: (value) {
              // This callback is triggered when the user submits the password.
              // You can handle the submission logic here, such as validating the password.
            },
            hintText: 'Enter your password', // Placeholder text for the input field.
            labelText: 'Password', // Label displayed above the input field.
            errorText: 'Password is required', // Error message displayed when validation fails.
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application, running the RealFlutter widget.
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the overall structure and theme for the app.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which includes an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains a Padding widget that adds space around the PasswordField.
// 5. The PasswordField widget is configured with callbacks for onChanged and onSubmitted, allowing for dynamic interaction.
// 6. The user can enter their password, and the field will display hints and error messages as needed.
