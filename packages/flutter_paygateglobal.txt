# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_paygateglobal

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_paygateglobal` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_paygateglobal` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_paygateglobal: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure you have the correct deployment target set in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # or higher
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, import the package and initialize it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_paygateglobal/flutter_paygateglobal.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `PaygateGlobal` class to initiate payments. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a payment button:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Paygate Global Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Call the payment method here
              initiatePayment();
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void initiatePayment() {
    // Implement payment logic here
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of flutter_paygateglobal

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_paygateglobal/flutter_paygateglobal.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Paygate Global Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Payment Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Initiate the payment process when the button is pressed
            initiatePayment(context);
          },
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void initiatePayment(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a payment request
    final paymentRequest = PaymentRequest(
      amount: 100.0, // Amount to be charged
      currency: 'USD', // Currency type
      description: 'Payment for Order #12345', // Description of the payment
    );

    // Call the Paygate Global payment method
    PaygateGlobal.processPayment(paymentRequest).then((result) {
      // Handle the payment result
      if (result.isSuccess) {
        // Show success message
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Successful!')),
        );
      } else {
        // Show error message
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Failed: ${result.errorMessage}')),
        );
      }
    }).catchError((error) {
      // Handle any errors during payment processing
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Error: $error')),
      );
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (PaymentScreen).
// 3. The PaymentScreen contains a button labeled "Pay Now".
// 4. When the button is pressed, the initiatePayment method is called.
// 5. A PaymentRequest object is created with the amount, currency, and description.
// 6. The PaygateGlobal.processPayment method is called with the payment request.
// 7. The result of the payment is handled in a callback, showing success or error messages accordingly.
// 8. Any errors during the payment process are caught and displayed to the user.
```
