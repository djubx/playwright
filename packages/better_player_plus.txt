# Tutorial: Setting Up Better Player Plus

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **better_player_plus** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **better_player_plus** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  better_player_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/better_player_plus).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple video player using **better_player_plus**.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:better_player_plus/better_player_plus.dart';
   ```

2. Create a `BetterPlayerController` and use it in your widget tree.

### Example Code

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:better_player_plus/better_player_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a BetterPlayerController with a video source
    BetterPlayerController betterPlayerController = BetterPlayerController(
      BetterPlayerConfiguration(
        aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
        autoPlay: true,
        looping: true,
      ),
    );

    // Set the video source (URL or asset)
    betterPlayerController.setupDataSource(
      BetterPlayerDataSource(
        BetterPlayerDataSourceType.network,
        'https://www.example.com/video.mp4',
      ),
    );

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Better Player Plus Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: BetterPlayer(
          controller: betterPlayerController,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(),
  ));
}
```

In this example, we create a simple video player that plays a video from a network URL. The player is set to autoplay and loop.

# Complete Example of Better Player Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:better_player_plus/better_player_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a BetterPlayerController with a video source
    BetterPlayerController betterPlayerController = BetterPlayerController(
      BetterPlayerConfiguration(
        aspectRatio: 16 / 9, // Set the aspect ratio for the video
        autoPlay: true, // Automatically play the video
        looping: true, // Loop the video playback
      ),
    );

    // Set the video source (URL or asset)
    betterPlayerController.setupDataSource(
      BetterPlayerDataSource(
        BetterPlayerDataSourceType.network, // Specify the data source type
        'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // URL of the video
      ),
    );

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Better Player Plus Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: BetterPlayer(
          controller: betterPlayerController, // Use the controller in the player
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(), // Run the RealFlutter widget
  ));
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which runs the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which builds the UI.
// 3. A BetterPlayerController is instantiated with specific configurations.
// 4. The video source is set to a network URL.
// 5. The BetterPlayer widget is displayed in the center of the screen, using the controller to manage playback.
// 6. The video will autoplay and loop as per the configuration.
```
