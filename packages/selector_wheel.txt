# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Selector Wheel

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the selector_wheel package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  selector_wheel: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Selector Wheel

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the selector wheel in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:selector_wheel/selector_wheel.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Selector Wheel Example',
      home: SelectorWheelDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class SelectorWheelDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SelectorWheelDemoState createState() => _SelectorWheelDemoState();
}

class _SelectorWheelDemoState extends State<SelectorWheelDemo> {
  // Variable to hold the selected value
  String selectedValue = "Select an option";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Selector Wheel Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected value
            Text(
              selectedValue,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Selector Wheel Widget
            SelectorWheel(
              // List of options to select from
              items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3', 'Option 4'],
              // Callback when an item is selected
              onItemSelected: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedValue = value; // Update the selected value
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home page.
// The SelectorWheelDemo widget is a stateful widget that maintains the selected value.
// In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// The Center widget contains a Column that displays the selected value and the SelectorWheel.
// The SelectorWheel takes a list of items and a callback function that updates the selected value.
// When an item is selected, the onItemSelected callback is triggered, updating the UI with the new selection.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, the application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget. The `RealFlutter` widget sets up the `MaterialApp` with a title and a home page. The `SelectorWheelDemo` widget is a stateful widget that maintains the selected value. 

In the `build` method, a `Scaffold` is created with an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget. The `Center` widget contains a `Column` that displays the selected value and the `SelectorWheel`. The `SelectorWheel` takes a list of items and a callback function that updates the selected value. When an item is selected, the `onItemSelected` callback is triggered, updating the UI with the new selection.

This structured approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the selector_wheel package, from its description and setup to a complete example demonstrating its functionality.
