# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Community Charts Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `community_charts_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `community_charts_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  community_charts_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/community_charts_flutter).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:community_charts_flutter/community_charts_flutter.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the package to create charts. Below is a simple example of how to create a line chart.

# Complete Example: Using Community Charts Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:community_charts_flutter/community_charts_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Community Charts Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Community Charts Flutter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: LineChart(
            // Sample data for the line chart
            seriesList: _createSampleData(),
            animate: true,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to create sample data for the line chart
  static List<Series<TimeSeriesSales, DateTime>> _createSampleData() {
    final data = [
      TimeSeriesSales(DateTime(2023, 1, 1), 5),
      TimeSeriesSales(DateTime(2023, 1, 2), 25),
      TimeSeriesSales(DateTime(2023, 1, 3), 100),
      TimeSeriesSales(DateTime(2023, 1, 4), 75),
    ];

    return [
      Series<TimeSeriesSales, DateTime>(
        id: 'Sales',
        colorFn: (_, __) => MaterialPalette.blue.shadeDefault,
        domainFn: (TimeSeriesSales sales, _) => sales.time,
        measureFn: (TimeSeriesSales sales, _) => sales.sales,
        data: data,
      )
    ];
  }
}

// Class to represent sales data over time
class TimeSeriesSales {
  final DateTime time;
  final int sales;

  TimeSeriesSales(this.time, this.sales);
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the LineChart.
// 4. The LineChart is created using the _createSampleData method, which generates sample sales data.
// 5. The _createSampleData method returns a list of Series objects, which define the data and how it should be displayed.
// 6. The TimeSeriesSales class is a simple data model that holds the time and sales values for the chart.
```
