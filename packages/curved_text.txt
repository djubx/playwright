# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Curved Text Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the **curved_text** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  curved_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:curved_text/curved_text.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Curved Text
You can now use the `CurvedText` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
CurvedText(
  text: Text(
    'Curved Text Example',
    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30, color: Colors.blue),
  ),
  curve: Curves.easeInOut,
  radius: 100,
)
```

This will create a curved text effect with the specified text and styling.

# Complete Example of Curved Text in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:curved_text/curved_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Curved Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Curved Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Curved text widget with specified text and styling
              CurvedText(
                text: Text(
                  'Welcome to Curved Text!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30, color: Colors.red),
                ),
                curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Animation curve for the text
                radius: 150, // Radius of the curve
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between text widgets
              // Another curved text example with different styling
              CurvedText(
                text: Text(
                  'Enjoy Creating!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 25, color: Colors.green),
                ),
                curve: Curves.bounceIn, // Different animation curve
                radius: 100, // Radius of the curve
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the curved text widgets vertically.
// 5. The first CurvedText widget displays "Welcome to Curved Text!" with a red color and a radius of 150.
// 6. A SizedBox is added for spacing between the two curved text widgets.
// 7. The second CurvedText widget displays "Enjoy Creating!" with a green color and a radius of 100.
// 8. The app showcases how to use the curved_text package to create visually appealing text layouts.
