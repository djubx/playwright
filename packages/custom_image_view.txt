# Custom Image View Flutter Package

The `custom_image_view` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance their image handling capabilities. This package allows for advanced image rendering, including support for various image formats, custom loading indicators, and error handling. It is particularly useful when you need to display images from different sources, such as network URLs, local assets, or file paths, while maintaining a high level of customization.

## When to Use This Package
- When you need to display images from multiple sources with custom loading and error states.
- When you want to implement advanced features like caching, resizing, or transformations on images.
- When you require a more flexible and customizable image widget than the default `Image` widget provided by Flutter.

## Key Features
- **Multiple Image Sources**: Load images from network URLs, local assets, or file paths.
- **Custom Loading Indicators**: Easily implement loading indicators while images are being fetched.
- **Error Handling**: Display custom error widgets when image loading fails.
- **Caching**: Built-in caching mechanism to improve performance and reduce network calls.
- **Transformations**: Apply transformations like scaling, cropping, and rotation to images.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Custom Image View

## Installation
To get started with the `custom_image_view` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  custom_image_view: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions for network access in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `custom_image_view` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:custom_image_view/custom_image_view.dart';
```

2. Use the `CustomImageView` widget in your widget tree:

```dart
CustomImageView(
  imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
  loadingWidget: CircularProgressIndicator(), // Custom loading indicator
  errorWidget: Icon(Icons.error), // Custom error widget
)
```

This simple setup allows you to display an image from a URL with a loading indicator and an error icon if the image fails to load.

# Complete Example of Custom Image View

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_image_view/custom_image_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom Image View Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Custom Image View Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomImageView(
            imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg', // URL of the image
            loadingWidget: CircularProgressIndicator(), // Display while loading
            errorWidget: Icon(Icons.error), // Display on error
            // Optional: Add transformations
            imageBuilder: (context, image) {
              return ClipOval( // Example of a transformation
                child: Image(image: image),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with a title and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a CustomImageView is created.
// 5. The CustomImageView attempts to load an image from the provided URL.
// 6. While the image is loading, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 7. If the image fails to load, an error icon is shown.
// 8. The image can be transformed using the imageBuilder property, here it is clipped to an oval shape.
