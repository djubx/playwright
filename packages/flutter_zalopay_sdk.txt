// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user clicks the "Pay with ZaloPay" button.
// 2. The `pay` method of the `RealFlutter` class is called.
// 3. The `pay` method creates an instance of the `ZaloPaySdk` class.
// 4. The `pay` method sets up the payment parameters, including the app ID, app key, amount, and description.
// 5. The `pay` method calls the `pay` method of the `ZaloPaySdk` class to initiate the payment.
// 6. The user is redirected to the ZaloPay payment page to complete the payment.
// 7. After the payment is completed, the user is redirected back to the application.
// 8. The `pay` method checks the payment result and prints a success or failure message.
