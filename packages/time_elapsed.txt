# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Time Elapsed Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **time_elapsed** package, you first need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  time_elapsed: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:time_elapsed/time_elapsed.dart';
```

2. Use the `TimeElapsed` widget to display the elapsed time:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Time Elapsed Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: TimeElapsed(
            startTime: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(hours: 2, minutes: 30)), // Example start time
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code will display how long ago the specified time was, updating in real-time.

# Complete Example of Time Elapsed Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:time_elapsed/time_elapsed.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Time Elapsed Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: TimeElapsed(
            startTime: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(hours: 2, minutes: 30)), // Set the start time
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Customize text style
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title "Time Elapsed Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The child of the Center widget is a TimeElapsed widget, which calculates and displays the time elapsed since the specified start time.
// 6. The start time is set to 2 hours and 30 minutes ago from the current time, and the text style is set to a font size of 24.
// 7. The TimeElapsed widget updates in real-time, providing users with the current elapsed time.
```
