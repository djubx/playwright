# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Kanji Drawing Animation Package

## Installation
To use the `kanji_drawing_animation` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  kanji_drawing_animation: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you plan to use any features that require user permissions. However, for basic usage of the `kanji_drawing_animation` package, no additional configuration is necessary.

## Using the Package
To use the `kanji_drawing_animation` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:kanji_drawing_animation/kanji_drawing_animation.dart';
```

You can then create a widget that utilizes the `KanjiDrawingAnimation` class to display the drawing animation of a specific Kanji character.

### Example Usage
Here’s a simple example of how to use the package in your Flutter application:

```dart
KanjiDrawingAnimation(
  kanji: '漢', // The Kanji character to animate
  duration: Duration(seconds: 3), // Duration of the animation
  onComplete: () {
    print('Animation completed!');
  },
);
```

This widget will animate the drawing of the Kanji character '漢' over a duration of 3 seconds and print a message when the animation is complete.

# Complete Example of Kanji Drawing Animation

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kanji_drawing_animation/kanji_drawing_animation.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Kanji Drawing Animation',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Kanji Drawing Animation Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: KanjiDrawingAnimation(
            kanji: '漢', // The Kanji character to animate
            duration: Duration(seconds: 3), // Duration of the animation
            onComplete: () {
              // Callback when the animation is complete
              print('Animation completed!');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Kanji Drawing Animation Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The child of the Center widget is the KanjiDrawingAnimation widget, which takes the Kanji character '漢'.
// 6. The animation duration is set to 3 seconds, and a callback function is provided to print a message when the animation completes.
// 7. When the app runs, the Kanji character will be animated on the screen, demonstrating how to write it stroke by stroke.
