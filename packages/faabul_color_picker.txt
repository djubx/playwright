import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:faabul_color_picker/faabul_color_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Color Picker Example',
      home: ColorPickerPage(),
    );
  }
}

class ColorPickerPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ColorPickerPageState createState() => _ColorPickerPageState();
}

class _ColorPickerPageState extends State<ColorPickerPage> {
  Color _currentColor = Colors.blue; // Default color

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Color Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: <Widget>[
          // Display the currently selected color
          Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: _currentColor,
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Selected Color',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
              ),
            ),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Color picker widget
          ColorPicker(
            pickerColor: _currentColor, // Set the initial color
            onColorChanged: (Color color) {
              setState(() {
                _currentColor = color; // Update the current color
              });
            },
            showLabel: true, // Show color label
            pickerAreaHeightPercent: 0.8, // Height of the color picker area
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home page.
// 3. ColorPickerPage is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected color.
// 4. The _ColorPickerPageState class contains a Color variable to hold the current color.
// 5. The build method constructs the UI, displaying a container with the selected color and the color picker.
// 6. When the user selects a new color, the onColorChanged callback updates the state, causing the UI to refresh and display the new color.
