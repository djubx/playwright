# Trust Location Flutter Package

The `trust_location` Flutter package is designed to simplify the process of obtaining and managing location permissions in Flutter applications. It provides a straightforward API for requesting location access, checking permission status, and handling location updates. This package is particularly useful for applications that require location-based services, such as navigation apps, delivery services, or any app that needs to provide location-aware features.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `trust_location` package when:
- Your application requires real-time location tracking.
- You need to request location permissions from users in a user-friendly manner.
- You want to handle location updates efficiently and manage permission states seamlessly.

## Key Features
- **Permission Management**: Easily request and check location permissions for both Android and iOS.
- **Location Updates**: Receive real-time location updates with minimal setup.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling for permission requests and location services.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

By leveraging the `trust_location` package, developers can focus on building location-based features without worrying about the underlying complexities of permission management and location services.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Trust Location

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `trust_location` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `trust_location` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  trust_location: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

2. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to request location permissions and get the user's current location.

# Complete Example of Trust Location

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:trust_location/trust_location.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _locationStatus = "Unknown"; // Variable to hold location status
  String _currentLocation = "Unknown"; // Variable to hold current location

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _checkLocationPermission(); // Check for location permission on startup
  }

  // Method to check and request location permission
  void _checkLocationPermission() async {
    // Check if location permission is granted
    var permissionStatus = await TrustLocation.checkPermission();
    if (permissionStatus == PermissionStatus.granted) {
      setState(() {
        _locationStatus = "Permission Granted"; // Update status
      });
      _getCurrentLocation(); // Get current location if permission is granted
    } else {
      // Request permission if not granted
      var result = await TrustLocation.requestPermission();
      if (result == PermissionStatus.granted) {
        setState(() {
          _locationStatus = "Permission Granted"; // Update status
        });
        _getCurrentLocation(); // Get current location after granting permission
      } else {
        setState(() {
          _locationStatus = "Permission Denied"; // Update status
        });
      }
    }
  }

  // Method to get the current location
  void _getCurrentLocation() async {
    // Fetch the current location
    var location = await TrustLocation.getCurrentLocation();
    setState(() {
      _currentLocation = "${location.latitude}, ${location.longitude}"; // Update current location
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text("Trust Location Example"),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text("Location Status: $_locationStatus"), // Display location status
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text("Current Location: $_currentLocation"), // Display current location
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that uses the trust_location package to manage location permissions and retrieve the user's current location. 

// 1. The app starts by checking for location permissions in the `initState` method.
// 2. If permission is granted, it fetches the current location using the `_getCurrentLocation` method.
// 3. If permission is denied, it requests permission from the user.
// 4. The app displays the current location and the status of the location permission on the screen.
// 5. The UI updates dynamically based on the permission status and the retrieved location.
