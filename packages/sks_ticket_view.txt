# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using SKS Ticket View

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `sks_ticket_view` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `sks_ticket_view` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sks_ticket_view: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `sks_ticket_view` in your app.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sks_ticket_view/sks_ticket_view.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SKS Ticket View Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('SKS Ticket View Example'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TicketView(), // Display the ticket view
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class TicketView extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SKSTicketView(
      ticketData: TicketData(
        title: 'Concert Ticket', // Ticket title
        date: '2024-09-12', // Ticket date
        time: '19:00', // Ticket time
        venue: 'Stadium XYZ', // Venue name
        price: '\$50', // Ticket price
      ),
      onTap: () {
        // Action when the ticket is tapped
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Ticket tapped!')),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds the MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the TicketView.
// 4. The TicketView class builds the SKSTicketView with ticket data.
// 5. When the ticket is tapped, a SnackBar is displayed to indicate the action.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that displays a ticket using the `sks_ticket_view` package. The `RealFlutter` class serves as the main entry point, setting up the app's structure. The `TicketView` class utilizes the `SKSTicketView` widget to present ticket information, including the title, date, time, venue, and price. When the ticket is tapped, a SnackBar appears, providing feedback to the user.

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget.
- The `RealFlutter` widget sets up a basic Material app with an AppBar and a centered ticket view.
- The `TicketView` widget constructs the ticket display using the `SKSTicketView` component, passing in relevant ticket data.
- User interaction with the ticket triggers a SnackBar notification, enhancing the user experience.

This structured approach to using the `sks_ticket_view` package allows developers to easily implement ticket displays in their Flutter applications, providing a clean and responsive design.
