# Flutter Network Connectivity Package

The `flutter_network_connectivity` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for easy monitoring of network connectivity status. This package is particularly useful in applications that require real-time updates on the user's internet connection, enabling developers to provide a seamless user experience by handling connectivity changes gracefully.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_network_connectivity` package in scenarios such as:

- **Real-time Data Applications**: Apps that rely on constant data updates, like chat applications or live sports scores, can benefit from knowing when the network is available or lost.
- **Offline Capabilities**: Applications that need to manage offline data storage and sync when the connection is restored.
- **User Notifications**: Informing users about their connectivity status, which can enhance user experience and reduce frustration.

## Features

- **Real-time Connectivity Monitoring**: Automatically detects changes in network status (Wi-Fi, mobile data, or no connection).
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Custom Callbacks**: Allows developers to define custom actions when connectivity changes occur.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and usage, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels.

With these features, the `flutter_network_connectivity` package is an essential tool for any Flutter application that requires network awareness.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_network_connectivity

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_network_connectivity` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_network_connectivity` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_network_connectivity: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement network connectivity monitoring.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_network_connectivity/flutter_network_connectivity.dart';
```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage connectivity status:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  ConnectivityStatus _status = ConnectivityStatus.unknown;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the connectivity listener
    FlutterNetworkConnectivity().onConnectivityChanged.listen((status) {
      setState(() {
        _status = status;
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Network Connectivity')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Current Status: $_status',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, run your app and observe the connectivity status updates.

# Complete Example of flutter_network_connectivity

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_network_connectivity/flutter_network_connectivity.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the current connectivity status
  ConnectivityStatus _status = ConnectivityStatus.unknown;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Listen for connectivity changes
    FlutterNetworkConnectivity().onConnectivityChanged.listen((status) {
      // Update the state with the new connectivity status
      setState(() {
        _status = status;
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Network Connectivity')),
        body: Center(
          // Display the current connectivity status
          child: Text(
            'Current Status: $_status',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a stateful widget.
// 3. In the initState method, we set up a listener for connectivity changes.
// 4. When the connectivity status changes, the listener updates the _status variable.
// 5. The build method rebuilds the UI to display the current connectivity status.
// 6. The user can see real-time updates on their network connectivity status.
