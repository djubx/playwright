## Setup Process

To get started with the `coupon_uikit` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `coupon_uikit` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     coupon_uikit: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open the `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` file in Xcode and ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart files, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:coupon_uikit/coupon_uikit.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

Once you have set up the package, you can start using its features. Here’s a simple example of how to create a coupon widget:

```dart
CouponCard(
  couponCode: 'SAVE20',
  discount: '20%',
  expiryDate: '31 Dec 2024',
  onTap: () {
    // Handle coupon tap
    print('Coupon tapped!');
  },
);
```

This code snippet creates a coupon card that displays a coupon code, discount percentage, and expiry date. The `onTap` callback allows you to define what happens when the user taps on the coupon.

# Complete Example

Here’s a complete Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the `coupon_uikit` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:coupon_uikit/coupon_uikit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Coupon UI Kit Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CouponHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class CouponHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Coupon UI Kit Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Displaying a coupon card
            CouponCard(
              couponCode: 'SAVE20', // The coupon code
              discount: '20%', // The discount percentage
              expiryDate: '31 Dec 2024', // Expiry date of the coupon
              onTap: () {
                // Action to perform when the coupon is tapped
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Coupon tapped!')),
                );
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
            // Another coupon card
            CouponCard(
              couponCode: 'FREESHIP', // Another coupon code
              discount: 'Free Shipping', // Description of the discount
              expiryDate: '15 Jan 2025', // Expiry date of the coupon
              onTap: () {
                // Action to perform when the coupon is tapped
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Free Shipping coupon tapped!')),
                );
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to CouponHomePage, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. In CouponHomePage, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget to center the content.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to stack the CouponCard widgets vertically.
// 6. Each CouponCard displays a coupon code, discount, and expiry date, and has an onTap callback to show a SnackBar when tapped.
// 7. The app demonstrates two coupon cards, showcasing how to use the package effectively.
