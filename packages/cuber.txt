# Cuber Flutter Package: A High-Level Overview

The **Cuber** package is a powerful state management solution for Flutter applications, designed to simplify the management of complex states in a reactive way. It leverages the concept of Cubit, which is a lightweight version of the Bloc pattern, making it easier to manage state without the boilerplate code often associated with traditional state management solutions.

## When to Use Cuber
Cuber is particularly useful in scenarios where:
- You need to manage multiple states across different parts of your application.
- You want a simple and efficient way to handle state changes without the complexity of full Bloc implementations.
- You are building applications that require real-time updates, such as chat applications or live data feeds.

## Key Features
- **Lightweight**: Cuber is designed to be minimalistic, reducing the amount of boilerplate code.
- **Reactive**: It allows for reactive programming, making it easy to listen to state changes.
- **Easy Integration**: Cuber can be easily integrated into existing Flutter applications.
- **Testable**: The architecture promotes testability, allowing developers to write unit tests for their state management logic.

Overall, Cuber is an excellent choice for developers looking for a straightforward yet powerful state management solution in Flutter.

# Cuber Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Cuber package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cuber: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/cuber).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use Cuber in your Flutter application, you will typically create a Cubit class that extends `Cubit<T>`, where `T` is the type of state you want to manage. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:cuber/cuber.dart';

class RealFlutter extends Cubit<int> {
  RealFlutter() : super(0); // Initial state

  void increment() => emit(state + 1); // Increment state
  void decrement() => emit(state - 1); // Decrement state
}
```

In your Flutter widget, you can then use the `BlocBuilder` to listen for state changes:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';

class CounterWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocBuilder<RealFlutter, int>(
      builder: (context, count) {
        return Text('Count: $count');
      },
    );
  }
}
```

This setup allows you to manage the state of a counter easily. You can call `increment()` and `decrement()` methods to change the state, and the UI will automatically update to reflect the current count.

# Cuber Flutter Package: Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';
import 'package:cuber/cuber.dart';

// Main function to run the app
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp widget that sets up the BlocProvider
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocProvider(
      create: (context) => RealFlutter(), // Providing the Cubit
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Cuber Example',
        home: CounterScreen(), // Home screen of the app
      ),
    );
  }
}

// CounterScreen widget that displays the counter
class CounterScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Cuber Counter Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying the current count
            BlocBuilder<RealFlutter, int>(
              builder: (context, count) {
                return Text(
                  'Count: $count', // Showing the count
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                );
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Increment button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                context.read<RealFlutter>().increment(); // Incrementing the count
              },
              child: Text('Increment'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            // Decrement button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                context.read<RealFlutter>().decrement(); // Decrementing the count
              },
              child: Text('Decrement'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up a BlocProvider that provides an instance of RealFlutter (the Cubit) to the widget tree.
// 3. The CounterScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 4. Inside CounterScreen, the current count is displayed using BlocBuilder, which listens for state changes.
// 5. When the Increment button is pressed, the increment() method is called, updating the state.
// 6. Similarly, pressing the Decrement button calls the decrement() method, updating the state.
// 7. The UI automatically rebuilds to reflect the current count whenever the state changes.
