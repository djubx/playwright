# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Open File Plus

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `open_file_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  open_file_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/open_file_plus).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions to read and write files. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to request permission to access files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to open files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to open files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to open a file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_file_plus/open_file_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Open File Plus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Specify the file path
              String filePath = '/path/to/your/file.pdf';
              // Open the file
              final result = await OpenFile.open(filePath);
              // Handle the result
              print(result.message);
            },
            child: Text('Open File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the specified file will be opened using the default application associated with its file type.

# Complete Example of Open File Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_file_plus/open_file_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Open File Plus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Specify the file path
              String filePath = '/path/to/your/file.pdf'; // Change this to your file path
              
              // Open the file using open_file_plus
              final result = await OpenFile.open(filePath);
              
              // Handle the result of the file opening
              if (result.type == ResultType.done) {
                // File opened successfully
                print('File opened successfully: ${result.message}');
              } else {
                // Handle error
                print('Error opening file: ${result.message}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Open File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. The file path is specified, pointing to the file you want to open.
// 6. The OpenFile.open method is called with the file path, which attempts to open the file.
// 7. The result of the file opening is checked. If successful, a success message is printed; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
```

In summary, the `open_file_plus` package provides a straightforward way to open files in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, you can easily integrate file opening functionality into your app, enhancing user experience and interaction with various file types.
