# Setting Up and Using flutter_ume_plus

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_ume_plus` package and how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add `flutter_ume_plus` to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_ume_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_ume_plus).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions if your app requires network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

To use `flutter_ume_plus`, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_ume_plus/flutter_ume_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter UME Plus Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code, we import the `flutter_ume_plus` package and initialize it within the `MyApp` widget. You can now start using its features throughout your application.

# Complete Example of flutter_ume_plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_ume_plus/flutter_ume_plus.dart';

void main() {
  // Run the application
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize the UME Plus package
    UMEPlus.init();

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter UME Plus Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _counter = 0; // Counter variable to demonstrate state management

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++; // Increment the counter
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build the UI
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter UME Plus Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            Text(
              '$_counter', // Display the counter value
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter, // Call the increment function
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp initializes the UME Plus package and sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget is created, which maintains a counter state.
// 4. The UI displays the current counter value and a button to increment it.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the _incrementCounter function is called,
//    which updates the state and rebuilds the UI with the new counter value.
```
