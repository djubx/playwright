                shape: ProgressShape.Circular,
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _updateProgress,
              child: Text('Update Progress'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application and is presented with a circular progress indicator.
// 2. The progress indicator is updated every time the user presses the "Update Progress" button.
// 3. The progress value is incremented by 0.1 each time the button is pressed.
// 4. If the progress value exceeds 1.0, it is reset to 0.0.
// 5. The progress indicator is animated smoothly to reflect the updated progress value.
```
