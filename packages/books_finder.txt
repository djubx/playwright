# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Books Finder Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **books_finder** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **books_finder** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  books_finder: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to ensure that your app has permission to access the internet. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a book search feature using the **books_finder** package.

# Complete Example: Implementing a Book Finder App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:books_finder/books_finder.dart'; // Import the books_finder package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Books Finder',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: BookSearchScreen(), // Set the home screen to BookSearchScreen
    );
  }
}

class BookSearchScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BookSearchScreenState createState() => _BookSearchScreenState();
}

class _BookSearchScreenState extends State<BookSearchScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController(); // Controller for the search input
  List<Book> _books = []; // List to hold the fetched books
  bool _isLoading = false; // Loading state

  // Function to search for books
  void _searchBooks() async {
    setState(() {
      _isLoading = true; // Set loading state to true
    });

    // Fetch books using the books_finder package
    final books = await BooksFinder.searchBooks(_controller.text);
    setState(() {
      _books = books; // Update the books list with the fetched books
      _isLoading = false; // Set loading state to false
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Books Finder')), // App bar with title
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _controller, // Set the controller for the text field
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Search for books',
                suffixIcon: IconButton(
                  icon: Icon(Icons.search), // Search icon
                  onPressed: _searchBooks, // Call search function on press
                ),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 16.0),
            _isLoading
                ? CircularProgressIndicator() // Show loading indicator while fetching
                : Expanded(
                    child: ListView.builder(
                      itemCount: _books.length, // Number of books to display
                      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                        final book = _books[index]; // Get the book at the current index
                        return ListTile(
                          title: Text(book.title), // Display book title
                          subtitle: Text(book.author), // Display book author
                          leading: book.coverImage != null
                              ? Image.network(book.coverImage) // Display book cover image
                              : null,
                        );
                      },
                    ),
                  ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to BookSearchScreen, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In BookSearchScreen, a TextField is provided for user input to search for books.
// 5. When the search button is pressed, the _searchBooks function is called.
// 6. The _searchBooks function fetches books based on the input text and updates the UI.
// 7. The fetched books are displayed in a ListView, showing the title, author, and cover image if available.
```

// Final Summary:
// The code implements a simple book finder application using the books_finder package. It allows users to search for books by entering a query in a text field. When the search button is pressed, the app fetches the relevant books and displays them in a list format. The application handles loading states and displays a loading indicator while fetching data. The overall flow is straightforward, making it easy to understand and extend for additional features.
