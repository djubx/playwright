# One Dollar Unistroke Recognizer Flutter Package

The `one_dollar_unistroke_recognizer` package is a Flutter implementation of the One Dollar Gesture Recognition algorithm. This package is designed to recognize simple gestures drawn by users on the screen, making it ideal for applications that require gesture-based input. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using this package in scenarios such as:
- Creating drawing applications where users can input gestures.
- Implementing custom controls in games or interactive applications.
- Enhancing user experience in applications that require quick input methods.

## Features
- **Gesture Recognition**: Recognizes a variety of simple gestures drawn by users.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback as users draw gestures.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to define their own gestures and recognition logic.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

This package is particularly useful for applications that aim to provide a more intuitive user interface through gesture recognition.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the One Dollar Unistroke Recognizer

## Installation
To add the `one_dollar_unistroke_recognizer` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  one_dollar_unistroke_recognizer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/one_dollar_unistroke_recognizer).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you plan to use any device features that require user permissions.

## Using the Package
To use the `one_dollar_unistroke_recognizer`, you will need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:one_dollar_unistroke_recognizer/one_dollar_unistroke_recognizer.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the recognizer and define the gestures you want to recognize. 

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up gesture recognition in your Flutter app:

1. Create a list of gestures.
2. Use the recognizer to detect gestures drawn by the user.
3. Provide feedback based on the recognized gesture.

This will be demonstrated in the complete example section below.

# Complete Example of One Dollar Unistroke Recognizer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:one_dollar_unistroke_recognizer/one_dollar_unistroke_recognizer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'One Dollar Unistroke Recognizer Demo',
      home: GestureRecognizerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class GestureRecognizerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _GestureRecognizerDemoState createState() => _GestureRecognizerDemoState();
}

class _GestureRecognizerDemoState extends State<GestureRecognizerDemo> {
  // Create an instance of the recognizer
  final OneDollarUnistrokeRecognizer recognizer = OneDollarUnistrokeRecognizer();
  String recognizedGesture = "Draw a gesture";

  // Define the gestures you want to recognize
  final List<Gesture> gestures = [
    Gesture(name: "Circle", points: [Offset(0, 0), Offset(1, 0), Offset(1, 1), Offset(0, 1)]),
    Gesture(name: "Square", points: [Offset(0, 0), Offset(1, 0), Offset(1, 1), Offset(0, 1)]),
  ];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Add gestures to the recognizer
    recognizer.addGestures(gestures);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Gesture Recognizer')),
      body: Center(
        child: GestureDetector(
          onPanUpdate: (details) {
            // Capture the user's drawing
            recognizer.addPoint(details.localPosition);
          },
          onPanEnd: (details) {
            // Recognize the gesture when the user lifts their finger
            final result = recognizer.recognize();
            setState(() {
              recognizedGesture = result?.name ?? "Unknown Gesture";
            });
            // Clear the recognizer for the next gesture
            recognizer.clear();
          },
          child: Container(
            width: 300,
            height: 300,
            color: Colors.grey[300],
            child: Center(child: Text(recognizedGesture)),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code sets up a simple Flutter application that recognizes gestures drawn by the user.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app and sets `RealFlutter` as the home widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. The `GestureRecognizerDemo` stateful widget manages the gesture recognition logic.
// 4. In `initState`, we create an instance of `OneDollarUnistrokeRecognizer` and add predefined gestures.
// 5. The `build` method creates a `GestureDetector` that listens for user input.
// 6. When the user draws on the screen, `onPanUpdate` captures the points.
// 7. When the user lifts their finger, `onPanEnd` recognizes the gesture and updates the UI with the recognized gesture name.
// 8. The recognized gesture is displayed in the center of a grey box, providing immediate feedback to the user.
