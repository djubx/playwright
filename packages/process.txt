The "process" Flutter package
==========================

The "process" package is a Flutter package that allows you to run processes in the background, providing a way to execute tasks that are not part of the main UI thread. This package is useful when you need to perform tasks that are computationally expensive or time-consuming, such as image processing, data compression, or network requests.

When to use this package
------------------------

You should use this package when:

* You need to perform a task that is not part of the main UI thread.
* You need to execute a task that is computationally expensive or time-consuming.
* You need to run a task in the background while the app is still running.

Features
--------

* Run processes in the background.
* Execute tasks that are not part of the main UI thread.
* Support for both Android and iOS platforms.

Setup and Usage
---------------

To use the "process" package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  process: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to get the package.

### Android Setup

For Android, you need to add the following configuration to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

### iOS Setup

For iOS, you need to add the following configuration to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

### Usage

To use the package, you need to import it in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:process/process.dart';
```

Then, you can use the `Process` class to run a process in the background:

```dart
Process process = Process(
  command: 'ls',
  arguments: ['-l'],
  workingDirectory: '/path/to/directory',
);

process.run().then((result) {
  print(result.stdout);
});
```

  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Process Package Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,

      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {

  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

    // Create a new process
    Process process = Process(
      command: 'ls',

      workingDirectory: '/path/to/directory',
    );

    // Run the process
    ProcessResult result = await process.run();

    // Update the UI with the output
    setState(() {
      _output = result.stdout;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Process Package Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_output),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _runProcess,
              child: Text('Run Process'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by running the main function, which creates a new instance of the MyApp widget.
// The MyApp widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a theme.
// The home property of the MaterialApp is set to an instance of the MyHomePage widget.
// The MyHomePage widget is a stateful widget that displays a button and a text output.
// When the button is pressed, the _runProcess function is called, which creates a new process and runs it.
// The output of the process is then displayed in the text output.
// The app uses the Process package to run a process in the background and display the output in the UI.
