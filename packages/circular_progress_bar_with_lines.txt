// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and sees a circular progress bar with lines.
// 2. The user clicks the "Update Progress" button to update the progress value.
// 3. The progress value is updated and the progress bar is redrawn to reflect the new value.
// 4. The user can continue to click the "Update Progress" button to update the progress value and see the progress bar update in real-time.
// The code uses a StatefulWidget to manage the state of the progress value and update the UI accordingly.
// The CircularProgressBarWithLines widget is used to display the circular progress bar with lines.
