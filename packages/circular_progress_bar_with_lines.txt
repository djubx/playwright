# Complete Example: Implementing Circular Progress Bar with Lines

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:circular_progress_bar_with_lines/circular_progress_bar_with_lines.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Circular Progress Bar Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Circular Progress Bar with Lines'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CircularProgressBarWithLines(
            value: 0.7, // Set the progress value to 70%
            strokeWidth: 8.0, // Set the width of the progress line
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey, // Background color of the circle
            progressColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the progress line
            // Optional parameters for customization
            animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the animation
            // You can add more customization options here
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Circular Progress Bar with Lines".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains the CircularProgressBarWithLines widget.
// 5. The CircularProgressBarWithLines widget is configured to show 70% progress with a blue line on a grey background.
// 6. The animation duration is set to 2 seconds, making the progress bar animate smoothly when displayed.
