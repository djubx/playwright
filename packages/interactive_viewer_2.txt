import 'package:interactive_viewer_2/interactive_viewer_2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Interactive Viewer 2 Example')),
      body: InteractiveViewer2(
        child: Image.network('https://example.com/large_image.jpg'),

# Complete Example of Interactive Viewer 2

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:interactive_viewer_2/interactive_viewer_2.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Interactive Viewer 2 Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Interactive Viewer 2 Example')),
        body: InteractiveViewer2(
          // The child widget that will be interactive
          child: Container(
            // A large container to demonstrate panning and zooming
            width: 1000,
            height: 1000,
            color: Colors.blueAccent,
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Zoom and Pan Me!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30, color: Colors.white),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of an InteractiveViewer2 widget, which allows for panning and zooming.
// 5. Inside the InteractiveViewer2, a large Container is defined to demonstrate the interactive features.
// 6. The Container has a blue background and a centered text that instructs the user to zoom and pan.
// 7. Users can interact with the Container by pinching to zoom and dragging to pan around the content.
