## Part 2: Tutorial

```markdown
<!-- START_TUTORIAL -->
# Setting Up flutter_login_vk

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_login_vk` package and explain how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_login_vk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_login_vk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, you need to perform the following steps:

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.vk.api.app_id"
            android:value="YOUR_VK_APP_ID" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Replace `YOUR_VK_APP_ID` with your actual VK application ID.

2. **Add Internet Permission**: Ensure you have the following permission in the same `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, follow these steps:

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>YOUR_VK_APP_ID</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

Replace `YOUR_VK_APP_ID` with your actual VK application ID.

2. **Add Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have configured your project, you can use the `flutter_login_vk` package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement VK login:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_login_vk/flutter_login_vk.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('VK Login Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              final result = await FlutterLoginVk.login();
              if (result != null) {
                // Handle successful login
                print('Logged in: ${result.name}');
              } else {
                // Handle login error
                print('Login failed');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Login with VK'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that triggers the VK login process. Upon successful login, the user's name is printed to the console.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate VK login into your Flutter application seamlessly.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of flutter_login_vk

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `flutter_login_vk` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_login_vk/flutter_login_vk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'VK Login Example',
      home: LoginScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class LoginScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LoginScreenState createState() => _LoginScreenState();
}

class _LoginScreenState extends State<LoginScreen> {
  String _userName = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('VK Login')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Welcome, $_userName'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _loginWithVK,
              child: Text('Login with VK'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to handle VK login
  Future<void> _loginWithVK() async {
    final result = await FlutterLoginVk.login();
    if (result != null) {
      // Update the user name on successful login
      setState(() {
        _userName = result.name; // Store the user's name
      });
      print('Logged in: ${result.name}'); // Log the user's name
    } else {
      // Handle login error
      print('Login failed');
    }
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The LoginScreen widget is created, which contains a stateful widget to manage user login.
// 4. The build method of LoginScreen displays a welcome message and a button to log in with VK.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the _loginWithVK function is called.
// 6. Inside _loginWithVK, the FlutterLoginVk.login() method is called to initiate the VK login process.
// 7. If the login is successful, the user's name is stored and displayed on the screen.
// 8. If the login fails, an error message is printed to the console.
