# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Better Pattern Lock Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **better_pattern_lock** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  better_pattern_lock: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to use biometric authentication alongside the pattern lock.

```xml
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>We use Face ID for authentication</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the pattern lock.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:better_pattern_lock/better_pattern_lock.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: PatternLockScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PatternLockScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PatternLockScreenState createState() => _PatternLockScreenState();
}

class _PatternLockScreenState extends State<PatternLockScreen> {
  String _pattern = '';
  final String _correctPattern = '123'; // Example pattern

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pattern Lock Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Draw your pattern:'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            PatternLock(
              onInputComplete: (String input) {
                setState(() {
                  _pattern = input;
                });
                if (_pattern == _correctPattern) {
                  // Navigate to the next screen or show success
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Pattern Correct!')),
                  );
                } else {
                  // Show error message
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Incorrect Pattern!')),
                  );
                }
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Entered Pattern: $_pattern'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using Better Pattern Lock

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:better_pattern_lock/better_pattern_lock.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: PatternLockScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PatternLockScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PatternLockScreenState createState() => _PatternLockScreenState();
}

class _PatternLockScreenState extends State<PatternLockScreen> {
  String _pattern = ''; // Variable to store the drawn pattern
  final String _correctPattern = '123'; // Example correct pattern

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pattern Lock Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Draw your pattern:'), // Instruction for the user
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            PatternLock(
              onInputComplete: (String input) {
                setState(() {
                  _pattern = input; // Update the drawn pattern
                });
                if (_pattern == _correctPattern) {
                  // If the pattern is correct, show success message
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Pattern Correct!')),
                  );
                } else {
                  // If the pattern is incorrect, show error message
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Incorrect Pattern!')),
                  );
                }
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Entered Pattern: $_pattern'), // Display the drawn pattern
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The PatternLockScreen widget is displayed, prompting the user to draw a pattern.
// 3. The user draws a pattern on the PatternLock widget.
// 4. Once the pattern is drawn, the onInputComplete callback is triggered.
// 5. The drawn pattern is compared to the correct pattern.
// 6. If the pattern matches, a success message is shown; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
// 7. The drawn pattern is also displayed on the screen for user reference.
