# Complete Example of flutter_color_plugin

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_color_plugin/flutter_color_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Color Plugin Example',
      home: ColorPickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ColorPickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ColorPickerScreenState createState() => _ColorPickerScreenState();
}

class _ColorPickerScreenState extends State<ColorPickerScreen> {
  Color selectedColor = Colors.blue; // Default color

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Color Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the selected color
            Container(
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              color: selectedColor,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open the color picker
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Open the color picker dialog
                Color? color = await FlutterColorPicker.showColorPickerDialog(
                  context,
                  initialColor: selectedColor,
                );
                // Update the selected color if a color was picked
                if (color != null) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedColor = color;
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick a Color'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the flutter_color_plugin.
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 2. The ColorPickerScreen widget is a stateful widget that maintains the selected color.
// 3. A default color (blue) is set for the selectedColor variable.
// 4. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 5. The Column displays a Container that shows the currently selected color and a button to open the color picker.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the color picker dialog is shown, allowing the user to select a color.
// 7. If a color is selected, the state is updated, and the UI reflects the new color selection.
