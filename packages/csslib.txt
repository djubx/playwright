# Overview of the `csslib` Flutter Package

The `csslib` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers who want to incorporate CSS-like styling into their Flutter applications. This package allows developers to define styles in a way that is familiar to those with web development experience, making it easier to manage and apply styles across a Flutter app.

## When to Use `csslib`

- **Consistency Across Platforms**: If you are developing a cross-platform application and want to maintain consistent styling, `csslib` can help you achieve that by allowing you to define styles in a centralized manner.
- **Ease of Use**: For developers transitioning from web development to Flutter, `csslib` provides a familiar syntax and approach to styling.
- **Dynamic Styling**: When you need to change styles dynamically based on user interactions or other runtime conditions, `csslib` offers a flexible way to manage these changes.

## Features

- **CSS Syntax**: Use CSS-like syntax to define styles, making it easy for web developers to adapt.
- **Style Inheritance**: Define base styles and extend them for specific components, reducing redundancy.
- **Responsive Design**: Easily implement responsive design principles by defining styles that adapt to different screen sizes.

# Setting Up and Using `csslib` in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `csslib` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add `csslib` to your `pubspec.yaml` file.
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     csslib: ^0.17.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependency.

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**: 
   - **Android**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
   - **iOS**: No specific configuration is required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher.

## Using `csslib`

To use `csslib`, you will typically parse CSS strings and apply them to your Flutter widgets. Here's a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:csslib/parser.dart' as css;
import 'package:csslib/visitor.dart';

void applyStyles(String cssString) {
  var stylesheet = css.parse(cssString);
  var visitor = new CssPrinter();
  stylesheet.visit(visitor);
  print(visitor.toString());
}
```

In this example, we parse a CSS string and print the resulting styles. You can extend this to apply styles to your widgets.

# Complete Example of Using `csslib` in Flutter

Below is a complete Flutter application demonstrating the use of `csslib` to style a simple widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:csslib/parser.dart' as css;
import 'package:csslib/visitor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'CSSLib Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('CSSLib in Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: StyledBox(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class StyledBox extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define a CSS string
    String cssString = '''
      .box {
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        background-color: blue;
        border-radius: 10px;
      }
    ''';

    // Parse the CSS string
    var stylesheet = css.parse(cssString);
    var visitor = new CssPrinter();
    stylesheet.visit(visitor);

    // For demonstration, we print the parsed CSS
    print(visitor.toString());

    // Return a styled container
    return Container(
      width: 100,
      height: 100,
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: Colors.blue,
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The `main` function initializes the app by running `RealFlutterApp`.
// `RealFlutterApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// The home of the app is a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// `StyledBox` is a stateless widget that represents a styled container.
// Inside `StyledBox`, a CSS string is defined to style a box.
// The CSS string is parsed using `csslib` to demonstrate its usage.
// The parsed CSS is printed to the console for verification.
// A `Container` widget is returned with styles matching the CSS string.
// The container has a width and height of 100px, a blue background, and rounded corners.

// Application Flow Summary:
// 1. The app starts with `RealFlutterApp`, setting up a basic MaterialApp.
// 2. `StyledBox` is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 3. A CSS string is defined and parsed using `csslib`.
// 4. The parsed CSS is printed to the console.
// 5. A `Container` is styled according to the CSS and displayed.
