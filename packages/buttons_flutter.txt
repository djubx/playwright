void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Buttons Flutter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Buttons Flutter Demo'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Raised button example
              RaisedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action for raised button
                  print('Raised Button Pressed');
                },
                child: Text('Raised Button'),
                color: Colors.blue,
                textColor: Colors.white,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between buttons
              // Flat button example
              FlatButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action for flat button
                  print('Flat Button Pressed');
                },
                child: Text('Flat Button'),
                color: Colors.transparent,
                textColor: Colors.blue,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between buttons
              // Icon button example
              IconButton(
                icon: Icon(Icons.favorite), // Using an icon
                color: Colors.red,
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action for icon button
                  print('Icon Button Pressed');
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange buttons vertically.
// 5. Three types of buttons are created: a RaisedButton, a FlatButton, and an IconButton.
// 6. Each button has an onPressed callback that prints a message to the console when pressed.
// 7. SizedBox widgets are used to add spacing between the buttons for better visual separation.
