# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `easy_draggable`

## Installation
To get started with `easy_draggable`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_draggable: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_draggable).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities related to drag-and-drop.

## Basic Usage
To use `easy_draggable`, wrap your widget with `Draggable` and specify the drag behavior. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_draggable/easy_draggable.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Draggable Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Draggable(
            data: 'Drag me!',
            feedback: Material(
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.blue,
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                child: Center(child: Text('Dragging')),
              ),
            ),
            childWhenDragging: Container(
              color: Colors.grey,
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              child: Center(child: Text('Original')),
            ),
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.green,
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              child: Center(child: Text('Drag me!')),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple draggable widget that changes its appearance when being dragged.

# Complete Example of `easy_draggable`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_draggable/easy_draggable.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Draggable Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Draggable(
            data: 'Drag me!', // The data that will be passed to the drop target
            feedback: Material(
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.blue, // Color of the widget while dragging
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                child: Center(child: Text('Dragging')),
              ),
            ),
            childWhenDragging: Container(
              color: Colors.grey, // Color of the original widget while dragging
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              child: Center(child: Text('Original')),
            ),
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.green, // Color of the widget when not dragging
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              child: Center(child: Text('Drag me!')),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutter` widget, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. Inside the `build` method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title 'Easy Draggable Example'.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. A Draggable widget is created with three main properties:
//    - `data`: The data that will be passed to the drop target when dropped.
//    - `feedback`: The widget that appears while dragging (blue container).
//    - `childWhenDragging`: The widget that appears in place of the original widget (grey container).
// 6. The original draggable widget is a green container with the text 'Drag me!'.
// 7. When the user drags the green container, it changes to the blue feedback widget, and the original widget turns grey.
// 8. This setup allows for a simple drag-and-drop interaction, demonstrating the core functionality of the `easy_draggable` package.
