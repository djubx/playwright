# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Custom OTP TextField

## Installation
To use the `custom_otp_textfield` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  custom_otp_textfield: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/custom_otp_textfield).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow for network requests if your OTP verification involves API calls.

## Using the Package
To use the `custom_otp_textfield`, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:custom_otp_textfield/custom_otp_textfield.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the OTP text field in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
CustomOtpTextField(
  length: 6, // Length of the OTP
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle the OTP input change
    print("OTP entered: $value");
  },
  onCompleted: (value) {
    // Handle the OTP completion
    print("OTP completed: $value");
  },
),
```

This will create a customizable OTP input field that listens for changes and completion events.

# Complete Example of Custom OTP TextField

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_otp_textfield/custom_otp_textfield.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom OTP TextField Example',
      home: OTPVerificationScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class OTPVerificationScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _OTPVerificationScreenState createState() => _OTPVerificationScreenState();
}

class _OTPVerificationScreenState extends State<OTPVerificationScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the OTP value
  String otp = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('OTP Verification'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Custom OTP TextField
            CustomOtpTextField(
              length: 6, // Set the length of the OTP
              onChanged: (value) {
                // Update the OTP variable on change
                setState(() {
                  otp = value;
                });
              },
              onCompleted: (value) {
                // Handle OTP completion
                print("OTP entered: $value");
                // Here you can add your verification logic
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to submit OTP
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Print the OTP when the button is pressed
                print("Submitted OTP: $otp");
                // You can add your verification logic here
              },
              child: Text('Submit OTP'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The OTPVerificationScreen is displayed, which contains the OTP input field and a submit button.
// 4. The CustomOtpTextField widget is created with a specified length of 6.
// 5. When the user types in the OTP, the onChanged callback updates the otp variable.
// 6. When the OTP is completed, the onCompleted callback can be used to trigger verification logic.
// 7. The submit button prints the entered OTP to the console, where you can implement further verification logic.
