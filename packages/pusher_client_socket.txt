# Pusher Client Socket Flutter Package

The `pusher_client_socket` package is a Flutter library that allows developers to easily integrate real-time communication into their applications using Pusher's WebSocket service. This package is particularly useful for applications that require instant updates, such as chat applications, live notifications, and collaborative tools.

## When to Use This Package
- **Real-time Chat Applications**: For building chat interfaces where messages need to be delivered instantly.
- **Live Notifications**: To push notifications to users in real-time, such as alerts or updates.
- **Collaborative Tools**: For applications that require multiple users to see updates simultaneously, like document editing or project management tools.

## Features
- **Real-time Communication**: Establishes a WebSocket connection to Pusher for instant message delivery.
- **Channel Management**: Supports subscribing to channels and listening for events.
- **Event Handling**: Allows developers to define custom event handlers for different types of messages.
- **Presence Channels**: Supports presence channels to track online users.
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Handles reconnections automatically in case of network issues.

This package simplifies the integration of real-time features into Flutter applications, making it a valuable tool for developers looking to enhance user engagement and interactivity.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Pusher Client Socket Package

## Installation
To get started with the `pusher_client_socket` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pusher_client_socket: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/pusher_client_socket).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `pusher_client_socket` package, you need to initialize the Pusher client and subscribe to channels. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pusher_client_socket/pusher_client_socket.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late PusherClient _pusherClient;
  late Channel _channel;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Pusher client with your app key and cluster
    _pusherClient = PusherClient(
      'YOUR_APP_KEY',
      PusherOptions(cluster: 'YOUR_APP_CLUSTER'),
      autoConnect: true,
    );

    // Subscribe to a channel
    _channel = _pusherClient.subscribe('my-channel');

    // Bind to an event
    _channel.bind('my-event', (PusherEvent event) {
      print('Received event: ${event.data}');
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Unsubscribe from the channel when the widget is disposed
    _pusherClient.unsubscribe('my-channel');
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pusher Client Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Listening for events...')),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes a Pusher client, subscribes to a channel, and listens for events. Make sure to replace `YOUR_APP_KEY` and `YOUR_APP_CLUSTER` with your actual Pusher credentials.

# Complete Example of Pusher Client Socket in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pusher_client_socket/pusher_client_socket.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late PusherClient _pusherClient; // Declare Pusher client
  late Channel _channel; // Declare channel for subscription

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Pusher client with your app key and cluster
    _pusherClient = PusherClient(
      'YOUR_APP_KEY', // Replace with your Pusher app key
      PusherOptions(cluster: 'YOUR_APP_CLUSTER'), // Replace with your Pusher app cluster
      autoConnect: true, // Automatically connect to Pusher
    );

    // Subscribe to a channel
    _channel = _pusherClient.subscribe('my-channel'); // Subscribe to 'my-channel'

    // Bind to an event
    _channel.bind('my-event', (PusherEvent event) {
      // Handle incoming event data
      print('Received event: ${event.data}'); // Print the event data to console
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Unsubscribe from the channel when the widget is disposed
    _pusherClient.unsubscribe('my-channel'); // Clean up by unsubscribing
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pusher Client Example')), // App bar title
      body: Center(child: Text('Listening for events...')), // Display message
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app initializes the Pusher client with the provided app key and cluster.
// 2. It subscribes to a channel named 'my-channel'.
// 3. The app listens for events named 'my-event' on that channel.
// 4. When an event is received, it prints the event data to the console.
// 5. When the widget is disposed, it unsubscribes from the channel to prevent memory leaks.
