# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `ubuntu_flavor`

## Installation

To get started with the `ubuntu_flavor` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ubuntu_flavor: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ubuntu_flavor).

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

1. Ensure that your Flutter environment is set up for desktop development.
2. You may need to configure your `AndroidManifest.xml` to support desktop features if you are targeting Android devices.

### iOS

1. Similar to Android, ensure your Flutter environment is set up for desktop development.
2. You may need to adjust your `Info.plist` file to accommodate any specific permissions or configurations required by the package.

## Basic Usage

Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a basic Ubuntu-themed application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ubuntu_flavor/ubuntu_flavor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ubuntu Flavor Example',
      theme: UbuntuThemeData(), // Applying Ubuntu theme
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Welcome to Ubuntu Flavor'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Hello, Ubuntu User!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with an Ubuntu theme. The `UbuntuThemeData` class is used to apply the Ubuntu styling to the app.

# Complete Example of `ubuntu_flavor`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ubuntu_flavor/ubuntu_flavor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ubuntu Flavor Example',
      theme: UbuntuThemeData(), // Applying Ubuntu theme
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Welcome to Ubuntu Flavor'), // Title of the app
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Hello, Ubuntu User!'), // Main content of the app
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp is configured with a title and an Ubuntu theme.
// 4. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 5. The HomePage widget builds a Scaffold, which provides the structure for the app.
// 6. The AppBar displays the title "Welcome to Ubuntu Flavor" at the top of the screen.
// 7. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 8. The child of the Center widget is a Text widget that displays "Hello, Ubuntu User!".
// 9. This simple structure allows for easy expansion and customization as needed.
