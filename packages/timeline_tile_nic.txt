# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Timeline Tile NIC Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `timeline_tile_nic` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `timeline_tile_nic` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  timeline_tile_nic: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a timeline using the `timeline_tile_nic` package.

# Complete Example of Using Timeline Tile NIC

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timeline_tile_nic/timeline_tile_nic.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Timeline Tile NIC Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Timeline Example'),
        ),
        body: TimelineExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class TimelineExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView(
      children: [
        TimelineTile(
          alignment: TimelineAlign.start,
          isFirst: true,
          indicatorStyle: IndicatorStyle(
            color: Colors.blue,
            iconStyle: IconStyle(
              iconData: Icons.event,
              color: Colors.white,
            ),
          ),
          endChild: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
            child: Text('Event 1: Project Kickoff'),
          ),
        ),
        TimelineTile(
          alignment: TimelineAlign.start,
          indicatorStyle: IndicatorStyle(
            color: Colors.green,
            iconStyle: IconStyle(
              iconData: Icons.check_circle,
              color: Colors.white,
            ),
          ),
          endChild: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
            child: Text('Event 2: Design Phase Completed'),
          ),
        ),
        TimelineTile(
          alignment: TimelineAlign.start,
          isLast: true,
          indicatorStyle: IndicatorStyle(
            color: Colors.red,
            iconStyle: IconStyle(
              iconData: Icons.launch,
              color: Colors.white,
            ),
          ),
          endChild: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
            child: Text('Event 3: Project Launched'),
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold containing an AppBar and the TimelineExample widget.
// 3. The TimelineExample widget creates a ListView containing multiple TimelineTile widgets.
// 4. Each TimelineTile represents an event in the timeline, with customizable indicators and content.
// 5. The timeline is displayed vertically, with each event clearly marked and described.
