# Overview of the onetrust_publishers_native_cmp Flutter Package

The `onetrust_publishers_native_cmp` package is designed to facilitate the integration of OneTrust's Consent Management Platform (CMP) into Flutter applications. This package allows developers to manage user consent for data collection in compliance with GDPR and CCPA regulations. It provides a native interface for displaying consent banners and managing user preferences seamlessly within Flutter apps.

## When to Use This Package
- **Compliance Needs**: If your application collects personal data from users, integrating a CMP is essential for legal compliance.
- **User Experience**: To provide users with clear options regarding their data privacy and consent preferences.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: When you need a solution that works on both Android and iOS without significant changes to your codebase.

## Key Features
- **Native Integration**: Leverages native components for a better user experience.
- **Customizable UI**: Allows customization of the consent banner to match your app's branding.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports multiple languages for global applications.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Automatically updates consent preferences in real-time.

This package is particularly useful for developers looking to ensure compliance with privacy regulations while maintaining a user-friendly interface.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using onetrust_publishers_native_cmp

## Installation
To add the `onetrust_publishers_native_cmp` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  onetrust_publishers_native_cmp: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/onetrust_publishers_native_cmp).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the necessary permissions and metadata for OneTrust:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.onetrust.publisher.CMP_ID"
            android:value="YOUR_CMP_ID" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the required configurations:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>OneTrustCMPID</key>
<string>YOUR_CMP_ID</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `onetrust_publishers_native_cmp` package, you need to initialize it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:onetrust_publishers_native_cmp/onetrust_publishers_native_cmp.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize OneTrust CMP
    OneTrust.init();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('OneTrust CMP Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the OneTrust CMP Example!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the OneTrust CMP in the `initState` method of our main widget. This ensures that the consent management is set up as soon as the app starts.

# Complete Example of onetrust_publishers_native_cmp

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:onetrust_publishers_native_cmp/onetrust_publishers_native_cmp.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize OneTrust CMP
    OneTrust.init();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('OneTrust CMP Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Welcome to the OneTrust CMP Example!'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Show the consent banner
                OneTrust.showConsentBanner();
              },
              child: Text('Show Consent Banner'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. In RealFlutter's state, the OneTrust CMP is initialized in the initState method.
// 4. The build method creates a simple UI with a welcome message and a button.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the consent banner is displayed using OneTrust.showConsentBanner().
// 6. Users can interact with the consent banner to manage their preferences.
