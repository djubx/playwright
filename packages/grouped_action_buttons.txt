# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Grouped Action Buttons

dependencies:
  grouped_action_buttons: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```

## Usage
To use the `grouped_action_buttons` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:grouped_action_buttons/grouped_action_buttons.dart';
```

You can then create a group of buttons using the `GroupedButtons` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
GroupedButtons(
  buttons: [
    ActionButton(
      label: 'Button 1',
      onPressed: () {
        // Handle button 1 action
      },
    ),
    ActionButton(
      label: 'Button 2',
      onPressed: () {
        // Handle button 2 action
      },
    ),
  ],
)
```

This will create a horizontal group of buttons that users can interact with.

# Complete Example of Grouped Action Buttons

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:grouped_action_buttons/grouped_action_buttons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Grouped Action Buttons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Grouped Action Buttons'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: GroupedButtons(
            buttons: [
              ActionButton(
                label: 'Button 1',
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action for Button 1
                  print('Button 1 pressed');
                },
              ),
              ActionButton(
                label: 'Button 2',
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action for Button 2
                  print('Button 2 pressed');
                },
              ),
              ActionButton(
                label: 'Button 3',
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action for Button 3
                  print('Button 3 pressed');
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Grouped Action Buttons'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a GroupedButtons widget.
// 5. The GroupedButtons widget has three ActionButton widgets, each with a label and an onPressed callback.
// 6. When a button is pressed, it prints a message to the console indicating which button was pressed.
