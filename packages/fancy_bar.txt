# Tutorial: Setting Up Fancy Bar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **fancy_bar** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **fancy_bar** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fancy_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 4: Using Fancy Bar

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **fancy_bar** in your app.

# Complete Example of Fancy Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fancy_bar/fancy_bar.dart'; // Import the fancy_bar package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fancy Bar Example',
      home: HomeScreen(), // Set the home screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  int _currentIndex = 0; // Track the current index of the selected tab

  // List of widgets to display for each tab
  final List<Widget> _children = [
    Center(child: Text('Home')),
    Center(child: Text('Search')),
    Center(child: Text('Profile')),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fancy Bar Example')), // App bar at the top
      body: _children[_currentIndex], // Display the current tab's widget
      bottomNavigationBar: FancyBar(
        currentIndex: _currentIndex, // Set the current index
        onTap: (index) { // Handle tab changes
          setState(() {
            _currentIndex = index; // Update the current index
          });
        },
        items: [
          FancyBarItem(icon: Icons.home, label: 'Home'), // Home tab
          FancyBarItem(icon: Icons.search, label: 'Search'), // Search tab
          FancyBarItem(icon: Icons.person, label: 'Profile'), // Profile tab
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The HomeScreen is the main screen of the app, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. The _HomeScreenState maintains the current index of the selected tab.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold displays the widget corresponding to the current tab.
// 6. The FancyBar widget is used as the bottom navigation bar, which takes the current index and a callback for when a tab is tapped.
// 7. When a tab is tapped, the current index is updated, and the corresponding widget is displayed in the body.
```
