void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PopupMenu Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  List<PopupMenuItem> menuItems = [
    PopupMenuItem(
      child: Text('Item 1'),
      onPressed: () {
        print('Item 1 pressed');
      },
    ),
    PopupMenuItem(
      child: Text('Item 2'),
      onPressed: () {
        print('Item 2 pressed');
      },
    ),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PopupMenu Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: PopupMenu(
          menuItems: menuItems,
          position: PopupMenuPosition.center,
          animation: PopupMenuAnimation.fade,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a screen containing a popup menu.
// 2. The popup menu is displayed at the center of the screen.
// 3. The user can click on one of the menu items to perform an action.
// 4. When a menu item is clicked, the corresponding action is performed and a message is printed to the console.
// 5. The user can dismiss the popup menu by clicking outside of it.
```

// The code flow is as follows:
// 1. The `MyApp` widget is created and returned as the root widget of the app.
// 2. The `MyHomePage` widget is created and returned as the home page of the app.
// 3. The `MyHomePage` widget creates a list of `PopupMenuItem` widgets and defines their actions.
// 4. The `PopupMenu` widget is created and displayed at the center of the screen.
// 5. The user can interact with the popup menu and perform actions.
