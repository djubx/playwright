# Simple Push Notification Flutter Package

The **simple_push_notification** package is a lightweight and easy-to-use solution for implementing push notifications in Flutter applications. It simplifies the process of integrating push notifications across both Android and iOS platforms, allowing developers to focus on building their applications without getting bogged down by the complexities of notification handling.

## When to Use This Package
- When you need to send real-time notifications to users.
- For applications that require user engagement through alerts, reminders, or updates.
- When you want a straightforward implementation without extensive configuration.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Setup**: Minimal configuration required to get started.
- **Customizable Notifications**: Allows customization of notification content and appearance.
- **Background Handling**: Supports handling notifications when the app is in the background or terminated.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Simple Push Notification

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **simple_push_notification** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_push_notification: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/simple_push_notification).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
```

2. Ensure you have the necessary capabilities enabled in Xcode for push notifications.

## Step 3: Initialize the Package
In your main Dart file, initialize the package in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_push_notification/simple_push_notification.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  SimplePushNotification.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Request Permissions
Request notification permissions from the user:

```dart
SimplePushNotification.requestPermissions();
```

## Step 5: Handle Notifications
Set up a listener to handle incoming notifications:

```dart
SimplePushNotification.onMessage.listen((message) {
  // Handle the received message
  print("Received message: $message");
});
```

Now you are ready to send and receive push notifications in your Flutter app!

# Complete Example of Simple Push Notification

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_push_notification/simple_push_notification.dart';

void main() {
  // Ensure Flutter binding is initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize the Simple Push Notification package
  SimplePushNotification.initialize();
  
  // Run the Flutter application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Push Notification Example',
      home: NotificationHome(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NotificationHomeState createState() => _NotificationHomeState();
}

class _NotificationHomeState extends State<NotificationHome> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    
    // Request notification permissions from the user
    SimplePushNotification.requestPermissions();
    
    // Listen for incoming messages
    SimplePushNotification.onMessage.listen((message) {
      // Display a dialog with the received message
      showDialog(
        context: context,
        builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
          title: Text("New Notification"),
          content: Text(message),
          actions: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
              child: Text("OK"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      );
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Push Notification Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Waiting for notifications...'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The application starts with the main() function, where Flutter's binding is initialized.
// 2. The Simple Push Notification package is initialized to set up the necessary configurations.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget is created, which serves as the main application widget.
// 4. Inside the NotificationHome widget, we request notification permissions from the user.
// 5. We set up a listener for incoming messages using SimplePushNotification.onMessage.
// 6. When a notification is received, an AlertDialog is displayed with the notification message.
// 7. The user can dismiss the dialog by pressing the "OK" button.
// 8. The app displays a simple message indicating that it is waiting for notifications.
