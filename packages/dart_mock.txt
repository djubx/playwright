# Introduction to dart_mock
================================

`dart_mock` is a popular Flutter package used for mocking dependencies in unit tests. It allows you to isolate the unit being tested and verify the interactions with its dependencies. In this blog, we will explore the features of `dart_mock` and provide a step-by-step guide on how to use it in your Flutter projects.

## When to use dart_mock
------------------------

`dart_mock` is particularly useful when you want to test a class that has dependencies on other classes or services. By mocking these dependencies, you can test the class in isolation and ensure that it behaves as expected.

## Features of dart_mock
-------------------------

*   Allows you to create mock objects that can be used in place of real dependencies
*   Supports mocking of classes, interfaces, and functions
*   Provides a range of matchers for verifying the interactions with the mock object

# Setting up dart_mock
-------------------------

To use `dart_mock` in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dart_mock: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Creating a Mock Object
---------------------------

To create a mock object, you need to use the `Mock` class provided by `dart_mock`. Here's an example:

```dart
import 'package:dart_mock/dart_mock.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final Logger _logger;

  RealFlutter(this._logger);

  void logMessage(String message) {
    _logger.log(message);
  }
}

class Logger {
  void log(String message) {
    // Log the message
  }
}

void main() {
  final loggerMock = Mock<Logger>();
  final realFlutter = RealFlutter(loggerMock);

  // Use the mock object
  realFlutter.logMessage('Hello, World!');
}
```

In this example, we create a mock object for the `Logger` class using `Mock<Logger>()`. We then pass this mock object to the `RealFlutter` class.

## Verifying Interactions
-------------------------

To verify the interactions with the mock object, you can use the `verify` method provided by `dart_mock`. Here's an example:

```dart
void main() {
  final loggerMock = Mock<Logger>();
  final realFlutter = RealFlutter(loggerMock);

  realFlutter.logMessage('Hello, World!');

  verify(() => loggerMock.log('Hello, World!')).called(1);
}
```

In this example, we use the `verify` method to check if the `log` method of the `Logger` class was called with the argument `'Hello, World!'`.

```dart
import 'package:dart_mock/dart_mock.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Define the Logger class
class Logger {
  void log(String message) {
    // Log the message
  }
}

// Define the RealFlutter class
class RealFlutter {
  final Logger _logger;

  RealFlutter(this._logger);

  void logMessage(String message) {
    // Call the log method of the Logger class
    _logger.log(message);
  }
}

void main() {
  // Create a mock object for the Logger class
  final loggerMock = Mock<Logger>();

  // Create an instance of the RealFlutter class with the mock object
  final realFlutter = RealFlutter(loggerMock);

  // Call the logMessage method of the RealFlutter class
  realFlutter.logMessage('Hello, World!');

  // Verify that the log method of the Logger class was called
  verify(() => loggerMock.log('Hello, World!')).called(1);

  // Run the Flutter app
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Hello, World!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The main function is the entry point of the Flutter app.
// It creates a mock object for the Logger class and an instance of the RealFlutter class with the mock object.
// It then calls the logMessage method of the RealFlutter class and verifies that the log method of the Logger class was called.
// Finally, it runs the Flutter app using the runApp function.
// The MyApp class is a stateless widget that returns a MaterialApp widget.
// The MyHomePage class is a stateless widget that returns a Scaffold widget with an AppBar and a Text widget.
