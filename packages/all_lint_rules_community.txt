# Setting Up the all_lint_rules_community Package

## Installation
To add the `all_lint_rules_community` package to your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file.
2. Add the package under the `dev_dependencies` section:

   ```yaml
   dev_dependencies:
     all_lint_rules_community: ^latest_version
   ```

3. Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Configuration
After installing the package, you need to configure it to use the lint rules. Create or update the `analysis_options.yaml` file in the root of your Flutter project with the following content:

```yaml
include: package:all_lint_rules_community/all_lint_rules.yaml
```

This configuration will include all the lint rules provided by the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly.

### iOS
Similar to Android, there are no additional configurations needed for iOS. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and configurations set up in your `Info.plist` if your app requires them.

## Running the Linter
To run the linter and check for any issues in your code, use the following command:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

This command will analyze your codebase and report any linting issues based on the rules defined in your `analysis_options.yaml` file.

# Complete Example of Using all_lint_rules_community

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // The main widget of the application
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'All Lint Rules Community Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Scaffold provides a structure for the visual interface
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Lint Rules Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to the Lint Rules Example!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when the button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (BuildContext context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Hello!'),
                      content: Text('This is a lint rules example.'),
                      actions: <Widget>[
                        TextButton(
                          child: Text('Close'),
                          onPressed: () {
                            Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                          },
                        ),
                      ],
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Show Dialog'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp sets up the app's title and theme, and specifies MyHomePage as the home widget.
// 4. MyHomePage is another StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 5. The UI consists of a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 6. The Column has a Text widget and an ElevatedButton.
// 7. When the button is pressed, it triggers a dialog to show up with a message.
// 8. The dialog can be closed by pressing the 'Close' button, which pops the dialog off the navigation stack.
