# Complete Example of ms_undraw in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ms_undraw/ms_undraw.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'ms_undraw Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('ms_undraw Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a happy illustration from ms_undraw
            UndrawIllustration(
              illustration: UndrawIllustrationType.happy,
              color: Colors.blue,
              height: 200,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between the illustration and text
            Text(
              'Welcome to the ms_undraw Example!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. HomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget as its body.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the Undraw illustration and a welcome text vertically.
// 6. The UndrawIllustration widget displays a happy illustration, customized with a blue color and a height of 200 pixels.
// 7. A SizedBox is used to add space between the illustration and the text for better visual separation.
```

// Final Summary:
// The application starts with the main function, which initializes the Flutter app. The RealFlutter class sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme. The HomePage class is the main screen, featuring an AppBar and a centered column layout. The column contains an illustration from the ms_undraw package and a welcome message, demonstrating how to integrate and customize illustrations in a Flutter app. This example showcases the ease of use and flexibility of the ms_undraw package, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit.
