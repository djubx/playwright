# Setting Up and Using dolphinsr_dart

## Installation
To add the `dolphinsr_dart` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dolphinsr_dart: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow network requests. Add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `dolphinsr_dart` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:dolphinsr_dart/dolphinsr_dart.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the main class, `RealFlutter`, and start making API calls. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to fetch data:

```dart
void main() async {
  RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();
  var data = await realFlutter.fetchData();
  print(data);
}
```

This code initializes the `RealFlutter` class and fetches data from the DolphinSR API, printing it to the console.

# Complete Example of Using dolphinsr_dart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dolphinsr_dart/dolphinsr_dart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'DolphinSR Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the fetched data
  String _data = 'Fetching data...';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch data when the widget is initialized
    _fetchData();
  }

  // Method to fetch data from the DolphinSR API
  Future<void> _fetchData() async {
    try {
      // Create an instance of the DolphinSR API client
      var client = DolphinSRClient();
      // Fetch data from the API
      var result = await client.fetchData();
      // Update the state with the fetched data
      setState(() {
        _data = result.toString();
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the fetch
      setState(() {
        _data = 'Error fetching data: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('DolphinSR Data'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(_data), // Display the fetched data
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages its state.
// 4. In the initState method, _fetchData is called to retrieve data from the DolphinSR API.
// 5. _fetchData creates an instance of DolphinSRClient and calls fetchData to get the data.
// 6. If successful, the state is updated with the fetched data, which is displayed in the UI.
// 7. If an error occurs, the error message is displayed instead.
```
