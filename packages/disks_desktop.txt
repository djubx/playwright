// Application flow:
// 1. The application starts and runs the main function.
// 2. The main function creates a new instance of the MyApp widget.
// 3. The MyApp widget builds the application's UI, including the MyHomePage widget.
// 4. The MyHomePage widget loads the list of disks using the disks_desktop package.
// 5. The MyHomePage widget displays the list of disks in a ListView.
// 6. The user can interact with the ListView to view details about each disk.

// Summary:
// The application uses the disks_desktop package to load a list of disks and display them in a ListView.
// The user can interact with the ListView to view details about each disk.
