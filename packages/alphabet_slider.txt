```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

# Complete Example of Alphabet Slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alphabet_slider/alphabet_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Alphabet Slider Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Alphabet Slider Demo'),
        ),
        body: AlphabetSliderExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class AlphabetSliderExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AlphabetSliderExampleState createState() => _AlphabetSliderExampleState();
}

class _AlphabetSliderExampleState extends State<AlphabetSliderExample> {
  // Variable to hold the selected letter
  String selectedLetter = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the selected letter
        Text(
          'Selected Letter: $selectedLetter',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        // Alphabet Slider Widget
        AlphabetSlider(
          onChanged: (String letter) {
            // Update the selected letter when the slider changes
            setState(() {
              selectedLetter = letter;
            });
          },
          // Customize the appearance of the slider
          sliderHeight: 300,
          sliderWidth: 50,
          textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.blue),
          // Optional: Add a list of items to display
          items: List.generate(26, (index) => String.fromCharCode(index + 65)),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 3. The AlphabetSliderExample is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the selected letter.
// 4. The AlphabetSlider widget is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 5. When the user interacts with the slider, the onChanged callback updates the selectedLetter state.
// 6. The selected letter is displayed above the slider, providing immediate feedback to the user.
```
