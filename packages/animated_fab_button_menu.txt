            AnimatedFabButtonMenuItem(

              onPressed: () {
                // Action for the third button
                print('Delete button pressed');
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget displaying a message.
// 4. The floatingActionButton property of the Scaffold is set to an AnimatedFabButtonMenu.
// 5. The AnimatedFabButtonMenu contains three items, each represented by an icon and an action.
// 6. When a user presses any of the FAB menu items, the corresponding action is executed, and a message is printed to the console.
