# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Omni Jitsi Meet

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **omni_jitsi_meet** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **omni_jitsi_meet** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  omni_jitsi_meet: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
        ...
    }
}
```

2. Add the required permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio during calls.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library for sharing images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement a simple video call feature.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:omni_jitsi_meet/omni_jitsi_meet.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Omni Jitsi Meet Example',
      home: VideoCallScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoCallScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoCallScreenState createState() => _VideoCallScreenState();
}

class _VideoCallScreenState extends State<VideoCallScreen> {
  // Define the room name for the video call
  final String roomName = "exampleRoom";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Jitsi Meet package
    OmniJitsiMeet.joinMeeting(
      roomName: roomName,
      userDisplayName: "User Name", // Set the display name for the user
      userEmail: "user@example.com", // Set the user's email
      userAvatarURL: "https://example.com/avatar.png", // Optional: User avatar URL
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Call'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Joining room: $roomName'),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Leave the meeting when the widget is disposed
    OmniJitsiMeet.leaveMeeting();
    super.dispose();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The VideoCallScreen widget is created, which initializes the video call.
// 4. In the initState method, the joinMeeting method is called to join the specified room.
// 5. The user can see a message indicating they are joining the room.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, the leaveMeeting method is called to clean up the resources.
```

In this blog, we have covered the **omni_jitsi_meet** Flutter package, including its description, setup tutorial, and a complete example. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the video call upon loading, displays a message to the user, and ensures proper cleanup when the call ends. This package provides a robust solution for integrating video conferencing into your Flutter applications, making it a valuable tool for developers.
