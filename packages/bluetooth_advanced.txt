# Bluetooth Advanced Flutter Package

The `bluetooth_advanced` package is a powerful Flutter plugin that provides advanced Bluetooth functionalities for mobile applications. It allows developers to easily integrate Bluetooth communication into their apps, enabling features such as device discovery, connection management, and data transfer. This package is particularly useful for applications that require interaction with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, such as wearables, health devices, and smart home products.

## When to Use This Package
- **IoT Applications**: When building applications that interact with Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
- **Health and Fitness Apps**: For connecting to health monitoring devices like heart rate monitors or fitness trackers.
- **Smart Home Solutions**: To control smart home devices such as lights, locks, and sensors.

## Key Features
- **Device Discovery**: Easily scan for nearby Bluetooth devices.
- **Connection Management**: Connect and disconnect from devices with ease.
- **Data Transfer**: Send and receive data between devices.
- **State Management**: Monitor the state of Bluetooth (enabled/disabled).
- **Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS with platform-specific optimizations.

Overall, `bluetooth_advanced` is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement Bluetooth functionalities in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Bluetooth Advanced

## Installation
To add the `bluetooth_advanced` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bluetooth_advanced: ^latest_version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
```

2. **Bluetooth Settings**: Ensure that Bluetooth is enabled in your app settings.

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to devices.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to devices.</string>
```

2. **Capabilities**: Enable the "Bluetooth" capability in your Xcode project settings.

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `bluetooth_advanced` package in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the package**:

```dart
import 'package:bluetooth_advanced/bluetooth_advanced.dart';
```

2. **Initialize Bluetooth**:

```dart
final bluetooth = BluetoothAdvanced();
```

3. **Scan for Devices**:

```dart
bluetooth.startScan();
```

4. **Connect to a Device**:

```dart
bluetooth.connect(deviceId);
```

5. **Send Data**:

```dart
bluetooth.sendData(data);
```

6. **Receive Data**:

```dart
bluetooth.onDataReceived.listen((data) {
  // Handle received data
});
```

This setup will allow you to start using Bluetooth functionalities in your Flutter app effectively.

# Complete Example of Bluetooth Advanced

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bluetooth_advanced/bluetooth_advanced.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final BluetoothAdvanced bluetooth = BluetoothAdvanced();
  List<BluetoothDevice> devices = []; // List to hold discovered devices
  String receivedData = ""; // Variable to hold received data

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start scanning for devices when the app initializes
    bluetooth.startScan();
    // Listen for discovered devices
    bluetooth.onDeviceDiscovered.listen((device) {
      setState(() {
        devices.add(device); // Add discovered device to the list
      });
    });
    // Listen for incoming data
    bluetooth.onDataReceived.listen((data) {
      setState(() {
        receivedData = data; // Update received data
      });
    });
  }

  // Function to connect to a selected device
  void connectToDevice(BluetoothDevice device) {
    bluetooth.connect(device.id); // Connect to the device
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Bluetooth Advanced Example')),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            Text('Discovered Devices:'),
            Expanded(
              child: ListView.builder(
                itemCount: devices.length,
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text(devices[index].name),
                    onTap: () => connectToDevice(devices[index]), // Connect on tap
                  );
                },
              ),
            ),
            Text('Received Data: $receivedData'), // Display received data
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    bluetooth.stopScan(); // Stop scanning when the widget is disposed
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that uses the bluetooth_advanced package to discover and connect to Bluetooth devices. 
// 
// 1. **Initialization**: The app initializes the BluetoothAdvanced instance and starts scanning for devices in the `initState` method.
// 2. **Device Discovery**: It listens for discovered devices and updates the UI with the list of devices.
// 3. **Connecting to Devices**: When a user taps on a device, the app connects to it.
// 4. **Receiving Data**: The app listens for incoming data and displays it on the screen.
// 5. **Cleanup**: The scanning is stopped when the widget is disposed to free up resources.

// This flow allows users to discover, connect, and interact with Bluetooth devices seamlessly.
