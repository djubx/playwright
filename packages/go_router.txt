Here's a detailed technical blog on the "go_router" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Go Router Flutter Package

The `go_router` package is a powerful routing solution for Flutter applications that simplifies navigation and enhances the overall user experience. It provides a declarative API for defining routes, making it easier to manage complex navigation scenarios. 

## When to Use `go_router`

You should consider using `go_router` when:
- You have a complex navigation structure with nested routes.
- You want to implement deep linking in your application.
- You need to manage stateful navigation and handle route transitions smoothly.
- You prefer a declarative approach to routing, which aligns well with Flutter's widget tree.

## Key Features
- **Declarative Routing**: Define routes in a clear and concise manner.
- **Nested Navigation**: Support for nested routes, allowing for complex UI structures.
- **Deep Linking**: Easily handle deep links to specific pages within your app.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in support for error pages and redirection.
- **Redirects**: Manage user redirection based on authentication or other conditions.

With these features, `go_router` provides a robust solution for managing navigation in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `go_router`

## Step 1: Adding Dependency

To get started with `go_router`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  go_router: ^6.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Basic Setup

After adding the dependency, you can set up your main application file. Here’s how to do it:

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the correct intent filters if you plan to use deep linking. Add the following inside the `<activity>` tag:

```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="yourapp" android:host="example.com" />
</intent-filter>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to configure your `Info.plist` to handle deep links. Add the following:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>yourapp</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using `go_router`

Now, let’s create a simple application using `go_router`. Below is a basic example of how to set up routes and navigate between them.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define the routes for the application
    final GoRouter _router = GoRouter(
      routes: <RouteBase>[
        // The home route
        GoRoute(
          path: '/',
          builder: (BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) {
            return HomeScreen();
          },
          // Nested route for details
          routes: <RouteBase>[
            GoRoute(
              path: 'details',
              builder: (BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) {
                return DetailsScreen();
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ],
      // Error handling route
      errorBuilder: (BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) {
        return ErrorScreen();
      },
    );

    // Return the MaterialApp with the router
    return MaterialApp.router(
      routerDelegate: _router.routerDelegate,
      routeInformationParser: _router.routeInformationParser,
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the details screen
            context.go('/details');
          },
          child: Text('Go to Details'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Details screen widget
class DetailsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Details')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is the details screen.'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Error screen widget
class ErrorScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Error')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Page not found!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the GoRouter with defined routes.
// 3. The home route ("/") displays the HomeScreen widget.
// 4. The HomeScreen contains a button that, when pressed, navigates to the DetailsScreen using context.go('/details').
// 5. The DetailsScreen displays a simple message.
// 6. If a user navigates to an undefined route, the ErrorScreen is displayed, showing a "Page not found!" message.

In this blog, we explored the `go_router` package, its features, and how to set it up in a Flutter application. The provided example demonstrates a simple navigation flow, showcasing how to define routes, handle navigation, and manage errors effectively. By using `go_router`, developers can create a more structured and maintainable navigation system in their Flutter apps.
