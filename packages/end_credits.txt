# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `end_credits` Package

## Installation
To get started with the `end_credits` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  end_credits: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `end_credits` package, you can create a simple widget that displays the credits. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:end_credits/end_credits.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: EndCredits(
          credits: [
            'John Doe - Developer',
            'Jane Smith - Designer',
            'Alice Johnson - Project Manager',
          ],
          duration: Duration(seconds: 10), // Duration for the credits to scroll
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple Flutter application that displays a list of credits with a scrolling effect.

# Complete Example of Using the `end_credits` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:end_credits/end_credits.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'End Credits Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('End Credits Demo'),
        ),
        body: EndCredits(
          // List of credits to display
          credits: [
            'John Doe - Developer',
            'Jane Smith - Designer',
            'Alice Johnson - Project Manager',
            'Bob Brown - Tester',
            'Charlie Black - Marketing',
          ],
          duration: Duration(seconds: 10), // Duration for the credits to scroll
          textStyle: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 20, // Font size for the credits
            color: Colors.white, // Text color
          ),
          backgroundColor: Colors.black, // Background color for the credits
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'End Credits Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains the EndCredits widget.
// 5. The EndCredits widget takes a list of credits, a duration for scrolling, text style, and background color.
// 6. The credits will scroll for the specified duration, providing a smooth end credits experience.
