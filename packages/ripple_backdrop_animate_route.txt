## Usage
To use the `ripple_backdrop_animate_route`, you can wrap your navigation calls with the `RippleBackdropAnimateRoute` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ripple_backdrop_animate_route/ripple_backdrop_animate_route.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the second screen with ripple effect
            Navigator.of(context).push(RippleBackdropAnimateRoute(
              builder: (context) => SecondScreen(),
            ));
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Screen')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Second Screen!')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the app navigates to the `SecondScreen` with a ripple animation.

# Complete Example of Ripple Backdrop Animate Route

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ripple_backdrop_animate_route/ripple_backdrop_animate_route.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // When the button is pressed, navigate to the SecondScreen
            Navigator.of(context).push(RippleBackdropAnimateRoute(
              builder: (context) => SecondScreen(),
            ));
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Screen')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Second Screen!')),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds the MaterialApp and sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen displays a button in the center of the screen.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback.
// 5. The callback uses Navigator to push a new route, which is the SecondScreen.
// 6. The RippleBackdropAnimateRoute creates a ripple effect during the transition.
// 7. SecondScreen displays a simple message in the center of the screen.
