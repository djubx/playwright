This package is particularly useful for obtaining details such as the build number, version, and other metadata that can be crucial for debugging, analytics, and user experience enhancements.

## When to Use

You might want to use the `build_info` package in scenarios such as:
- Displaying the app version and build number in the app settings or about page.
- Sending build information to analytics services for better tracking of app versions in use.
- Debugging issues by logging build information when errors occur.

## Features

- **Access to Build Information**: Retrieve the app's version and build number easily.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate and use within your Flutter application.

Overall, the `build_info` package simplifies the process of accessing and utilizing build information, making it an essential tool for Flutter developers.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Build Info Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `build_info` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  build_info: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        versionCode 1 // Increment this for each release
        versionName "1.0.0" // Update this for each release
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that the version and build number are set correctly in the project settings.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to access the build information:

```dart
import 'package:build_info/build_info.dart';

void main() async {
  final buildInfo = await BuildInfo.getBuildInfo();
  print('Version: ${buildInfo.version}');
  print('Build Number: ${buildInfo.buildNumber}');
}
```

This code snippet retrieves the build information and prints it to the console. You can use this information in your app as needed.

# Complete Example of Using Build Info

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:build_info/build_info.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure that Flutter is initialized before running the app
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // Retrieve build information
  final buildInfo = await BuildInfo.getBuildInfo();

  // Run the app with the retrieved build information
  runApp(RealFlutter(buildInfo: buildInfo));
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  final BuildInfo buildInfo;

  // Constructor to accept build information
  RealFlutter({required this.buildInfo});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Build Info Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Build Info Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display the app version
              Text(
                'App Version: ${buildInfo.version}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              // Display the build number
              Text(
                'Build Number: ${buildInfo.buildNumber}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized() ensures that the Flutter framework is initialized.
// 3. BuildInfo.getBuildInfo() is called to retrieve the build information asynchronously.
// 4. The app is then run using runApp(), passing an instance of RealFlutter with the retrieved build information.
// 5. In the RealFlutter widget, the build method constructs the UI, displaying the app version and build number in the center of the screen.
