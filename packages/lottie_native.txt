# Setting Up and Using Lottie Native

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the **lottie_native** package and how to use it effectively in your Flutter project.

## Installation

To add the **lottie_native** package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  lottie_native: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/lottie_native).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Podfile`.
2. Ensure that you have the platform set to at least iOS 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

3. Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

To use the **lottie_native** package, you can create a simple widget that loads and displays a Lottie animation. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lottie_native/lottie_native.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Lottie Native Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: LottieNative(
          asset: 'assets/animation.json', // Path to your Lottie file
          width: 200, // Width of the animation
          height: 200, // Height of the animation
          fit: BoxFit.fill, // How the animation should be fitted
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to load a Lottie animation from an asset and display it in the center of the screen. 

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the **lottie_native** package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Lottie Native in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lottie_native/lottie_native.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Lottie Native Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home to our main widget
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Lottie Native Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: LottieNative(
          asset: 'assets/animation.json', // Path to your Lottie file
          width: 200, // Width of the animation
          height: 200, // Height of the animation
          fit: BoxFit.fill, // How the animation should be fitted
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is our main widget.
// 4. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, we use LottieNative to display an animation.
// 6. The Lottie animation is loaded from the specified asset path and displayed with the given width and height.
