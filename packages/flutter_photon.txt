# Setting Up and Using the `flutter_photon` Package

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_photon`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_photon: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_photon).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest
    ...
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Podfile`.
2. Ensure that you have the platform set to at least iOS 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_photon` package, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_photon/flutter_photon.dart';
```

2. Load an image and apply a filter:

```dart
// Load an image from assets
final image = await loadImage('assets/sample.jpg');

// Apply a filter
final filteredImage = await Photon.applyFilter(image, FilterType.sepia);
```

3. Display the filtered image in your widget tree.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `flutter_photon` package into your Flutter application and start applying filters to images.

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_photon`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_photon/flutter_photon.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Photon Example',
      home: ImageFilterScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ImageFilterScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImageFilterScreenState createState() => _ImageFilterScreenState();
}

class _ImageFilterScreenState extends State<ImageFilterScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the original and filtered images
  Image? originalImage;
  Image? filteredImage;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load the original image when the widget is initialized
    loadImage();
  }

  Future<void> loadImage() async {
    // Load an image from assets
    final image = await loadImage('assets/sample.jpg');
    setState(() {
      originalImage = image; // Set the original image
    });
  }

  Future<void> applyFilter() async {
    // Apply a sepia filter to the original image
    final image = await Photon.applyFilter(originalImage, FilterType.sepia);
    setState(() {
      filteredImage = image; // Set the filtered image
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Filter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the original image
            if (originalImage != null) originalImage!,
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the filtered image if available
            if (filteredImage != null) filteredImage!,
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: applyFilter, // Apply filter on button press
              child: Text('Apply Sepia Filter'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that uses the `flutter_photon` package to apply a sepia filter to an image.
// 
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home screen as `ImageFilterScreen`.
// 3. In `ImageFilterScreen`, the original image is loaded in the `initState` method.
// 4. The `applyFilter` method applies a sepia filter to the original image when the button is pressed.
// 5. The UI displays both the original and filtered images, allowing users to see the effect of the filter.
// 
// This example showcases how to integrate the `flutter_photon` package into a Flutter application, providing a straightforward way to apply image filters.
