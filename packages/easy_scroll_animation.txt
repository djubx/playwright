# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Easy Scroll Animation

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **easy_scroll_animation** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **easy_scroll_animation** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_scroll_animation: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement scroll animations using the **easy_scroll_animation** package.

# Complete Example of Easy Scroll Animation

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_scroll_animation/easy_scroll_animation.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Scroll Animation Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Easy Scroll Animation'),
        ),
        body: ScrollAnimationExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ScrollAnimationExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return EasyScrollAnimation(
      duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Set the duration of the animation
      child: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: 20, // Number of items in the list
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return Container(
            margin: EdgeInsets.all(10), // Margin around each item
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(20), // Padding inside each item
            color: Colors.blueAccent, // Background color of each item
            child: Text(
              'Item $index', // Display the item index
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20), // Text style
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body that displays the ScrollAnimationExample widget.
// 4. ScrollAnimationExample uses EasyScrollAnimation to wrap a ListView.builder.
// 5. The ListView.builder creates a list of 20 items, each with a blue background and white text.
// 6. The EasyScrollAnimation widget applies a smooth scrolling animation to the list items as they come into view.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the **easy_scroll_animation** package. The application consists of a list of items that animate into view as the user scrolls. 

### Summary of Application Flow

- The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget.
- The `RealFlutter` widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with a title and a `Scaffold` containing an `AppBar` and a body.
- The body of the `Scaffold` contains the `ScrollAnimationExample` widget, which utilizes the `EasyScrollAnimation` widget to wrap a `ListView.builder`.
- The `ListView.builder` generates a list of 20 items, each styled with a blue background and white text.
- As the user scrolls through the list, the items animate smoothly into view, enhancing the overall user experience.

This structured approach to using the **easy_scroll_animation** package allows developers to easily implement engaging scroll animations in their Flutter applications.
