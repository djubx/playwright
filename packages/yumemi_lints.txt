# Setting Up and Using Yumemi Lints

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `yumemi_lints` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter projects.

## Installation

To add `yumemi_lints` to your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file.
2. Add `yumemi_lints` under the `dev_dependencies` section:

   ```yaml
   dev_dependencies:
     yumemi_lints: ^latest_version
   ```

3. Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Configuration

After installing the package, you need to configure it to use the lint rules. Create a new file named `analysis_options.yaml` in the root of your Flutter project and add the following content:

```yaml
include: package:yumemi_lints/yumemi_lints.yaml
```

This configuration will include the default lint rules provided by `yumemi_lints`.

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your Flutter project is set up correctly.

### iOS
Similarly, for iOS, no specific configurations are needed. The linting rules will apply across both platforms.

## Using Yumemi Lints

Once you have set up the package, you can start using it immediately. As you write your Flutter code, the linter will automatically check for any violations of the defined rules. You can view the linting results in your IDE's problems panel.

To run the linter manually, use the following command:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

This command will analyze your code and report any issues based on the lint rules defined in your `analysis_options.yaml` file.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate `yumemi_lints` into your Flutter development workflow and ensure high code quality throughout your project.

# Complete Example of Yumemi Lints in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The main widget of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Yumemi Lints Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// Home page widget
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Yumemi Lints Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to Yumemi Lints!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (BuildContext context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Hello!'),
                      content: Text('This is a Yumemi Lints example.'),
                      actions: <Widget>[
                        TextButton(
                          child: Text('Close'),
                          onPressed: () {
                            Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                          },
                        ),
                      ],
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Show Dialog'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() to start the app.
2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
3. The MaterialApp contains a title and a theme, and it sets MyHomePage as the home widget.
4. MyHomePage is another StatelessWidget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the Text and ElevatedButton vertically.
6. When the button is pressed, it triggers a dialog to show up with a message.
7. The dialog has a close button that dismisses the dialog when pressed.

### Summary of Application Flow
The application starts with the `main()` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget. This widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with a title and theme, and it designates `MyHomePage` as the home screen. The `MyHomePage` widget displays a welcome message and a button. When the button is pressed, an alert dialog appears, demonstrating a simple interaction. The code is structured to follow best practices, and the use of `yumemi_lints` ensures that any potential issues are flagged during development, promoting clean and maintainable code.
