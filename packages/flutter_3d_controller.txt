# Setting Up and Using `flutter_3d_controller`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_3d_controller` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `flutter_3d_controller` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_3d_controller: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command to install the new package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

No additional configuration is required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 10.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package

To use the `flutter_3d_controller`, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_3d_controller/flutter_3d_controller.dart';
```

### Basic Usage

Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and integrate it into your widget tree:

```dart
RealFlutter(
  modelPath: 'assets/models/sample.obj',
  onModelLoaded: () {
    print('Model loaded successfully!');
  },
)
```

- **modelPath**: Path to your 3D model file.
- **onModelLoaded**: Callback function when the model is successfully loaded.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_3d_controller/flutter_3d_controller.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter 3D Controller Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  RealFlutterController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = RealFlutterController();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('3D Model Viewer'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: RealFlutter(
          controller: _controller,
          modelPath: 'assets/models/sample.obj',
          onModelLoaded: () {
            print('Model loaded successfully!');
          },
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _resetModel,
        tooltip: 'Reset Model',
        child: Icon(Icons.refresh),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _resetModel() {
    // Reset the 3D model to its initial state
    _controller.reset();
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The application starts by running the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a home page of MyHomePage.
// 3. MyHomePage is a stateful widget that initializes a RealFlutterController in its state.
// 4. The build method of MyHomePage returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing the RealFlutter widget.
// 5. The RealFlutter widget is configured with a modelPath pointing to a 3D model file and a controller for managing interactions.
// 6. A FloatingActionButton is provided to reset the model to its initial state using the controller's reset method.
// 7. When the model is loaded, a message is printed to the console.
