# Kiosk Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **kiosk** Flutter package is designed to help developers create kiosk applications that run in a locked-down mode, providing a controlled environment for users. This package is particularly useful for applications that require limited user interaction, such as information kiosks, digital signage, or self-service terminals.

## When to Use the Kiosk Package
- **Information Kiosks**: Displaying information in public spaces where user interaction is minimal.
- **Self-Service Terminals**: Allowing users to perform specific tasks without accessing the full device functionality.
- **Digital Signage**: Presenting advertisements or information in a controlled manner.

## Key Features
- **Kiosk Mode Activation**: Easily switch your app into kiosk mode, restricting access to other applications.
- **Customizable UI**: Tailor the user interface to fit the specific needs of your kiosk application.
- **User Interaction Control**: Limit user interactions to specific areas of the app, enhancing security and usability.
- **Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, with specific configurations for each platform.

The **kiosk** package is a powerful tool for developers looking to create focused applications that require a high level of control over user interactions.

# Setting Up and Using the Kiosk Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **kiosk** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the **kiosk** package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  kiosk: ^latest_version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions to enable kiosk mode:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.DISABLE_KEYGUARD"/>
```

3. Ensure that your app is set to be a device owner. This typically requires additional setup, such as using ADB commands to set your app as the device owner.

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow your app to run in a restricted mode:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Using the Kiosk Package

Once the package is installed and configured, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to activate kiosk mode:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kiosk/kiosk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: KioskHome(),
    );
  }
}

class KioskHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _KioskHomeState createState() => _KioskHomeState();
}

class _KioskHomeState extends State<KioskHome> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Activate kiosk mode
    Kiosk.startKioskMode();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Kiosk Mode Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Kiosk!')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that activates kiosk mode when the app starts. The `Kiosk.startKioskMode()` method is called in the `initState` of the `KioskHome` widget.

# Complete Example of the Kiosk Package

Here is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the **kiosk** package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kiosk/kiosk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: KioskHome(),
    );
  }
}

class KioskHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _KioskHomeState createState() => _KioskHomeState();
}

class _KioskHomeState extends State<KioskHome> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Activate kiosk mode when the app starts
    Kiosk.startKioskMode();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Kiosk Mode Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Welcome to the Kiosk!'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action for button press
                // This could be a navigation to another screen or a specific function
                print('Button Pressed!');
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with KioskHome as the home widget.
// 3. In the KioskHome widget, the initState method is called, which activates kiosk mode.
// 4. The build method creates a simple UI with a welcome message and a button.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it triggers an action (in this case, a print statement).
// 6. The app remains in kiosk mode, restricting access to other applications and functionalities.
