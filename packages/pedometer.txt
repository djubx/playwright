# Understanding the Pedometer Flutter Package

The `pedometer` Flutter package is a powerful tool for developers looking to integrate step counting and pedometer functionalities into their mobile applications. This package provides a simple and efficient way to access step count data from the device's sensors, making it ideal for fitness apps, health tracking applications, or any app that benefits from monitoring user activity.

## When to Use the Pedometer Package

- **Fitness Applications**: Track user steps to provide insights into their daily activity levels.
- **Health Monitoring**: Integrate step data to help users maintain a healthy lifestyle.
- **Gamification**: Use step counts to unlock achievements or rewards in games.
- **Research and Data Collection**: Collect step data for studies or surveys related to physical activity.

## Features

- **Real-time Step Counting**: Access live step count data as the user moves.
- **Background Activity Tracking**: Continue tracking steps even when the app is not in the foreground.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Available for both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate with minimal setup required.

# Setting Up the Pedometer Package in Your Flutter Project

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `pedometer` package in a Flutter project, including platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Step 1: Add the Dependency

First, add the `pedometer` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pedometer: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION" />
   ```

2. **API Level**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 18:

   ```gradle
   defaultConfig {
       minSdkVersion 18
   }
   ```

### iOS

1. **Permissions**: Add the following to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for motion data:

   ```xml
   <key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires access to motion data to track your steps.</string>
   ```

2. **Podfile**: Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least iOS 10:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Pedometer Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. The next section will provide a complete example demonstrating its usage.

<-- MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pedometer/pedometer.dart';

void main() => runApp(RealFlutter());

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late Stream<StepCount> _stepCountStream;
  String _steps = '0';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the step count stream
    _stepCountStream = Pedometer.stepCountStream;
    // Listen to the step count stream
    _stepCountStream.listen(_onStepCount).onError(_onStepCountError);
  }

  void _onStepCount(StepCount event) {
    // Update the step count when a new event is received
    setState(() {
      _steps = event.steps.toString();
    });
  }

  void _onStepCountError(error) {
    // Handle errors from the step count stream
    print('Step Count Error: $error');
    setState(() {
      _steps = 'Step Count not available';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Pedometer Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Steps taken: $_steps',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app initializes and sets up a stream to listen for step count data.
// 2. The `initState` method sets up the step count stream and listens for updates.
// 3. When a new step count is received, `_onStepCount` updates the UI with the new count.
// 4. If an error occurs, `_onStepCountError` handles it and updates the UI accordingly.
// 5. The UI displays the current step count in the center of the screen.
```
