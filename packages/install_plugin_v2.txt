## Part 2: Tutorial

```markdown
<!-- START_TUTORIAL -->
# Setting Up and Using the `install_plugin_v2` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `install_plugin_v2` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

### Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `install_plugin_v2` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  install_plugin_v2: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the necessary permissions and configurations. For example:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<application>
    ...
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.example.install_plugin_v2"
        android:value="true" />
</application>
```

#### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add any required permissions. For example:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

### Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to install a plugin dynamically.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:install_plugin_v2/install_plugin_v2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Install Plugin Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Attempt to install a plugin
              bool success = await InstallPluginV2.install('plugin_name');
              if (success) {
                // Plugin installed successfully
                print('Plugin installed!');
              } else {
                // Failed to install plugin
                print('Failed to install plugin.');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Install Plugin'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Summary

In this tutorial, we covered the installation and configuration of the `install_plugin_v2` package for both Android and iOS platforms. We also demonstrated how to use the package to install a plugin dynamically within a Flutter application.

## Part 3: Complete Example

<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of Using `install_plugin_v2`

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `install_plugin_v2` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:install_plugin_v2/install_plugin_v2.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Install Plugin Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Install Plugin Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Attempt to install a plugin dynamically
              bool success = await InstallPluginV2.install('plugin_name');
              if (success) {
                // If the plugin is installed successfully, show a success message
                print('Plugin installed successfully!');
              } else {
                // If the installation fails, show an error message
                print('Failed to install the plugin.');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Install Plugin'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback.
// 5. Inside the callback, the app attempts to install a plugin using InstallPluginV2.install().
// 6. If the installation is successful, a success message is printed to the console.
// 7. If the installation fails, an error message is printed instead.
