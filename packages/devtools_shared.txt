# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using devtools_shared

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `devtools_shared` package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `devtools_shared` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  devtools_shared: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/devtools_shared).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add specific configurations in your `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package as follows:

```dart
import 'package:devtools_shared/devtools_shared.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the features provided by the `devtools_shared` package in your Flutter application. For example, you can initialize the logging utility and start monitoring performance metrics.

```dart
void main() {
  // Initialize the logging utility
  DevToolsLogger.initialize();

  // Start the application
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This setup will allow you to leverage the debugging and performance monitoring features of the `devtools_shared` package effectively.

# Complete Example of Using devtools_shared

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:devtools_shared/devtools_shared.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the logging utility
  DevToolsLogger.initialize();

  // Start the application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'DevTools Shared Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Variable to hold performance metrics
  String _performanceMetrics = 'No metrics yet';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start monitoring performance metrics
    _startPerformanceMonitoring();
  }

  void _startPerformanceMonitoring() {
    // Simulate performance monitoring
    DevToolsPerformance.startMonitoring();
    // Update performance metrics after some time
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 5), () {
      setState(() {
        _performanceMetrics = DevToolsPerformance.getMetrics();
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Performance Metrics:',
            ),
            Text(
              _performanceMetrics,
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Log an event when the button is pressed
          DevToolsLogger.logEvent('Floating Action Button Pressed');
        },
        tooltip: 'Log Event',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the DevToolsLogger and starts the RealFlutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 4. In the HomeScreen's initState, performance monitoring starts.
// 5. After 5 seconds, the performance metrics are fetched and displayed on the screen.
// 6. A Floating Action Button is provided to log an event when pressed, demonstrating the logging feature of the devtools_shared package.
