# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using sa4_migration_kit

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `sa4_migration_kit` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter applications.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `sa4_migration_kit` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sa4_migration_kit: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initialize and use the `sa4_migration_kit` in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sa4_migration_kit/sa4_migration_kit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SA4 Migration Kit Example',
      home: MigrationHome(),
    );
  }
}

class MigrationHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MigrationHomeState createState() => _MigrationHomeState();
}

class _MigrationHomeState extends State<MigrationHome> {
  String _migrationStatus = 'Not Started';

  void _startMigration() async {
    setState(() {
      _migrationStatus = 'Migrating...';
    });

    // Initialize the migration process
    final result = await Sa4MigrationKit.migrate();

    setState(() {
      _migrationStatus = result ? 'Migration Successful' : 'Migration Failed';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SA4 Migration Kit'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Migration Status: $_migrationStatus'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startMigration,
              child: Text('Start Migration'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that allows users to start the migration process by pressing a button. The migration status is displayed on the screen.

# Complete Example of sa4_migration_kit

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sa4_migration_kit/sa4_migration_kit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SA4 Migration Kit Example',
      home: MigrationHome(),
    );
  }
}

class MigrationHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MigrationHomeState createState() => _MigrationHomeState();
}

class _MigrationHomeState extends State<MigrationHome> {
  String _migrationStatus = 'Not Started'; // Initialize migration status

  void _startMigration() async {
    setState(() {
      _migrationStatus = 'Migrating...'; // Update status to indicate migration has started
    });

    // Initialize the migration process
    final result = await Sa4MigrationKit.migrate(); // Call the migrate method from the package

    setState(() {
      // Update the migration status based on the result
      _migrationStatus = result ? 'Migration Successful' : 'Migration Failed';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SA4 Migration Kit'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Migration Status: $_migrationStatus'), // Display current migration status
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between text and button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startMigration, // Start migration when button is pressed
              child: Text('Start Migration'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (MigrationHome).
// 3. MigrationHome is a stateful widget that manages the migration status.
// 4. When the user presses the "Start Migration" button, the _startMigration method is called.
// 5. The migration status is updated to "Migrating..." while the migration process is ongoing.
// 6. The Sa4MigrationKit.migrate() method is called to perform the migration.
// 7. Once the migration is complete, the status is updated to either "Migration Successful" or "Migration Failed" based on the result.
