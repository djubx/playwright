# Dart Pusher Channels Flutter Package

The `dart_pusher_channels` package is a powerful tool for integrating real-time communication into Flutter applications. It leverages the Pusher Channels service, allowing developers to build interactive applications that can send and receive messages instantly. This package is particularly useful for applications that require real-time updates, such as chat applications, live notifications, collaborative tools, and more.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `dart_pusher_channels` package when:
- You need to implement real-time features in your Flutter app.
- Your application requires instant updates from a server, such as notifications or chat messages.
- You want to enhance user engagement through live data updates.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Communication**: Easily send and receive messages in real-time.
- **Channel Management**: Support for public, private, and presence channels.
- **Event Handling**: Listen for events and trigger actions based on incoming data.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

With these features, the `dart_pusher_channels` package simplifies the process of adding real-time capabilities to your Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up dart_pusher_channels

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `dart_pusher_channels` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `dart_pusher_channels` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dart_pusher_channels: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure Pusher

You need to create an account on [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) and set up a new application. Once you have your app created, you will receive your `app_id`, `key`, and `secret`. These credentials are necessary for connecting to the Pusher service.

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add internet permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Initialize Pusher in Your App

Now, you can initialize Pusher in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_pusher_channels/dart_pusher_channels.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late Pusher pusher;
  late Channel channel;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Pusher
    pusher = Pusher(
      'YOUR_APP_KEY',
      PusherOptions(cluster: 'YOUR_APP_CLUSTER'),
    );

    // Connect to Pusher
    pusher.connect();

    // Subscribe to a channel
    channel = pusher.subscribe('my-channel');

    // Bind to an event
    channel.bind('my-event', (data) {
      print('Received data: $data');
      // Handle incoming data
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    pusher.disconnect();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pusher Channels Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Listening for events...')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code:
- We initialize Pusher with our app key and options.
- We connect to Pusher and subscribe to a channel.
- We bind to an event to listen for incoming data.

# Complete Example of dart_pusher_channels

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_pusher_channels/dart_pusher_channels.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late Pusher pusher; // Declare a Pusher instance
  late Channel channel; // Declare a Channel instance

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Pusher with your app key and cluster
    pusher = Pusher(
      'YOUR_APP_KEY', // Replace with your Pusher app key
      PusherOptions(cluster: 'YOUR_APP_CLUSTER'), // Replace with your Pusher app cluster
    );

    // Connect to Pusher
    pusher.connect();

    // Subscribe to a channel named 'my-channel'
    channel = pusher.subscribe('my-channel');

    // Bind to an event named 'my-event'
    channel.bind('my-event', (data) {
      print('Received data: $data'); // Print the received data
      // Here you can handle the incoming data, e.g., update the UI
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    pusher.disconnect(); // Disconnect from Pusher when the widget is disposed
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pusher Channels Example')), // App bar title
      body: Center(child: Text('Listening for events...')), // Centered text
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter's state is managed by _RealFlutterState.
// 4. In initState, we initialize Pusher with the app key and cluster.
// 5. We connect to Pusher and subscribe to 'my-channel'.
// 6. We bind to 'my-event' to listen for incoming data.
// 7. When data is received, it is printed to the console.
// 8. The app displays a simple UI indicating it is listening for events.
// 9. On dispose, we disconnect from Pusher to clean up resources.
```
