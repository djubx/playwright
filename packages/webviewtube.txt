# Tutorial: Setting Up WebviewTube

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the WebviewTube package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the WebviewTube package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  webviewtube: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/webviewtube).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow arbitrary loads:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the WebviewTube package:

```dart
import 'package:webviewtube/webviewtube.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using WebviewTube

You can now use the WebviewTube widget in your application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
WebviewTube(
  videoId: 'YOUR_VIDEO_ID', // Replace with your YouTube video ID
  autoPlay: true, // Set to true to autoplay the video
  aspectRatio: 16 / 9, // Set the aspect ratio for the video
)
```

This widget will display the specified YouTube video within your app.

# Complete Example of WebviewTube

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application using the WebviewTube package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:webviewtube/webviewtube.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'WebviewTube Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('WebviewTube Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: WebviewTube(
            videoId: 'dQw4w9WgXcQ', // Example YouTube video ID
            autoPlay: true, // Automatically play the video
            aspectRatio: 16 / 9, // Set the aspect ratio for the video
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'WebviewTube Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers the WebviewTube widget.
// 5. The WebviewTube widget is configured to play a specific YouTube video automatically with a 16:9 aspect ratio.
// 6. When the app runs, it displays the video in a web view, allowing users to watch it directly within the app.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that utilizes the WebviewTube package to display a YouTube video. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the app, sets up the UI with an AppBar, and embeds the video in the center of the screen. The video plays automatically, providing a seamless experience for users.

In summary, the WebviewTube package is a versatile tool for integrating web content into Flutter applications, particularly for video streaming. With easy setup and customization options, it can enhance the functionality and user experience of your apps.
