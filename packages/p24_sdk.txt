# Setting Up and Using p24_sdk

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `p24_sdk` package and explain how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the `p24_sdk` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  p24_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/p24_sdk).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

This allows your app to make network requests to the P24 payment gateway.

## Basic Usage

To use the `p24_sdk` package, you will need to initialize the payment process and handle the payment response. Below is a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:p24_sdk/p24_sdk.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('P24 Payment Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize the P24 payment
              final paymentResponse = await P24Sdk.startPayment(
                amount: 100.0, // Amount to be charged
                currency: 'PLN', // Currency code
                orderId: '123456', // Unique order ID
              );

              // Handle the payment response
              if (paymentResponse.isSuccess) {
                // Payment was successful
                print('Payment successful: ${paymentResponse.transactionId}');
              } else {
                // Payment failed
                print('Payment failed: ${paymentResponse.errorMessage}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of p24_sdk in Action

Here is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `p24_sdk` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:p24_sdk/p24_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('P24 Payment Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Start the payment process
              final paymentResponse = await P24Sdk.startPayment(
                amount: 100.0, // Amount to be charged
                currency: 'PLN', // Currency code
                orderId: '123456', // Unique order ID
              );

              // Check if the payment was successful
              if (paymentResponse.isSuccess) {
                // If successful, print the transaction ID
                print('Payment successful: ${paymentResponse.transactionId}');
              } else {
                // If failed, print the error message
                print('Payment failed: ${paymentResponse.errorMessage}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'), // Button to initiate payment
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the payment process is initiated using P24Sdk.startPayment().
// 5. The payment amount, currency, and order ID are passed to the payment method.
// 6. The response from the payment process is checked for success or failure.
// 7. If successful, the transaction ID is printed; if failed, the error message is printed.
