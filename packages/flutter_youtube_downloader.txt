2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.

```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_youtube_downloader/flutter_youtube_downloader.dart';
```

2. Create a function to download a video:

```dart
Future<void> downloadVideo(String videoUrl) async {
  try {
    // Start the download process
    var response = await FlutterYoutubeDownloader.downloadVideo(
      videoUrl: videoUrl,
      quality: VideoQuality.high, // Choose the quality
      format: VideoFormat.mp4, // Choose the format
    );

    // Check the response
    if (response != null) {
      print('Download successful: ${response.path}');
    } else {
      print('Download failed');
    }
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error: $e');
  }
}
```

3. Call the `downloadVideo` function with a valid YouTube video URL.

With these steps, you can successfully set up and use the `flutter_youtube_downloader` package in your Flutter application.

}

class _DownloaderScreenState extends State<DownloaderScreen> {
  String _videoUrl = '';
  String _downloadStatus = '';

  // Function to download video
  Future<void> downloadVideo() async {
    try {
      // Start the download process
      var response = await FlutterYoutubeDownloader.downloadVideo(
        videoUrl: _videoUrl,

        format: VideoFormat.mp4, // Choose the format
      );

      // Check the response
      if (response != null) {
        setState(() {

        });
      } else {
        setState(() {
          _downloadStatus = 'Download failed';
        });
      }
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _downloadStatus = 'Error: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('YouTube Downloader'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter YouTube Video URL'),
              onChanged: (value) {
                _videoUrl = value; // Update video URL
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: downloadVideo, // Trigger download
              child: Text('Download Video'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_downloadStatus), // Display download status
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The DownloaderScreen widget is displayed, containing a TextField for the user to input a YouTube video URL.
// 3. When the user enters a URL and presses the "Download Video" button, the downloadVideo function is called.
// 4. The downloadVideo function uses the flutter_youtube_downloader package to download the video.
