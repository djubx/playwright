# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Universal Web Image

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **universal_web_image** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **universal_web_image** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  universal_web_image: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/universal_web_image).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions for network access in your `Info.plist` file. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to load an image from a URL using the **universal_web_image** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:universal_web_image/universal_web_image.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Universal Web Image Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: UniversalWebImage(
            imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
            placeholder: CircularProgressIndicator(),
            errorWidget: Icon(Icons.error),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays an image from a URL. The `UniversalWebImage` widget takes care of loading the image, showing a placeholder while the image is loading, and displaying an error icon if the image fails to load.

# Complete Example of Universal Web Image

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:universal_web_image/universal_web_image.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Universal Web Image Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Universal Web Image Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: UniversalWebImage(
            // The URL of the image to be loaded
            imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
            // Placeholder widget displayed while the image is loading
            placeholder: CircularProgressIndicator(),
            // Widget displayed if the image fails to load
            errorWidget: Icon(Icons.error),
            // Optional: Set the width and height of the image
            width: 300,
            height: 300,
            // Optional: Set the fit of the image
            fit: BoxFit.cover,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Universal Web Image Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains the UniversalWebImage widget.
// 5. The UniversalWebImage widget attempts to load the image from the specified URL.
// 6. While the image is loading, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed as a placeholder.
// 7. If the image fails to load, an error icon is shown instead.
// 8. The image is displayed with a width and height of 300 pixels and is set to cover the available space.
