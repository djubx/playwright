# Selectable Draggable ListBox: A Comprehensive Overview

The `selectable_draggable_listbox` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to create interactive list boxes that allow users to select and drag items seamlessly. This package is particularly useful in applications where users need to manage lists of items, such as to-do lists, shopping lists, or any scenario where item reordering is required.

## When to Use This Package
- **Task Management Apps**: For creating to-do lists where users can prioritize tasks by dragging them.
- **Shopping Lists**: Allowing users to reorder items based on preference or urgency.
- **Customizable Interfaces**: Enabling users to personalize their experience by rearranging items.

## Key Features
- **Selectable Items**: Users can select multiple items at once.
- **Draggable Functionality**: Items can be dragged to reorder them within the list.
- **Customizable UI**: The appearance of the list and items can be easily customized to fit the app's design.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both Android and iOS platforms, adapting to different screen sizes.

This package enhances user experience by providing intuitive controls for managing lists, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Selectable Draggable ListBox

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `selectable_draggable_listbox` package and demonstrate how to implement it in a Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the `selectable_draggable_listbox` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  selectable_draggable_listbox: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/selectable_draggable_listbox).

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `selectable_draggable_listbox`, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:selectable_draggable_listbox/selectable_draggable_listbox.dart';
```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the list state.

3. Use the `SelectableDraggableListBox` widget to display your list.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:selectable_draggable_listbox/selectable_draggable_listbox.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  List<String> items = ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3", "Item 4"];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Selectable Draggable ListBox")),
      body: SelectableDraggableListBox(
        items: items,
        onReorder: (oldIndex, newIndex) {
          setState(() {
            if (newIndex > oldIndex) newIndex--;
            final item = items.removeAt(oldIndex);
            items.insert(newIndex, item);
          });
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic selectable and draggable list box. The `onReorder` callback updates the list when items are dragged and dropped.

Now you are ready to implement the `selectable_draggable_listbox` in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Selectable Draggable ListBox

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:selectable_draggable_listbox/selectable_draggable_listbox.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List of items to be displayed in the list box
  List<String> items = ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3", "Item 4"];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Selectable Draggable ListBox")),
      body: SelectableDraggableListBox(
        // Pass the list of items to the SelectableDraggableListBox
        items: items,
        // Callback function to handle reordering of items
        onReorder: (oldIndex, newIndex) {
          setState(() {
            // Adjust the newIndex if the item is moved down
            if (newIndex > oldIndex) newIndex--;
            // Remove the item from the old index and insert it at the new index
            final item = items.removeAt(oldIndex);
            items.insert(newIndex, item);
          });
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts here
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(),
  ));
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MaterialApp.
2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a stateful widget.
3. Inside the _RealFlutterState class, a list of items is defined.
4. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a SelectableDraggableListBox.
5. The SelectableDraggableListBox takes the list of items and a callback function for reordering.
6. When an item is dragged and dropped, the onReorder callback is triggered, updating the state with the new order of items.
7. The UI automatically updates to reflect the changes in the list.
