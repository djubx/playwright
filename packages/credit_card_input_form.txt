# Complete Example of Using `credit_card_input_form`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:credit_card_input_form/credit_card_input_form.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Credit Card Input Form',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Credit Card Input Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: CreditCardInputForm(
            onCreditCardModelChange: (CreditCardModel data) {
              // This callback is triggered when the credit card model changes
              print(data);
            },
            // Customize the appearance of the input fields
            theme: CreditCardInputTheme(
              cardNumberDecoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Card Number',
                hintText: 'XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
              expiryDateDecoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Expiry Date',
                hintText: 'MM/YY',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
              cvvDecoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'CVV',
                hintText: 'XXX',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold.
// 3. Inside the scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Credit Card Input Example'.
// 4. The body of the scaffold contains a Padding widget to provide spacing around the CreditCardInputForm.
// 5. The CreditCardInputForm widget is configured with a callback that prints the credit card model whenever it changes.
// 6. The appearance of the input fields is customized using the CreditCardInputTheme, allowing for a tailored user experience.
