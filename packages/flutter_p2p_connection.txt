# flutter_p2p_connection Package Overview

The `flutter_p2p_connection` package is a powerful tool for establishing peer-to-peer (P2P) connections in Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require direct communication between devices without relying on a central server. Typical use cases include file sharing, multiplayer gaming, and real-time data exchange.

## Features
- **Direct Device Communication**: Establishes connections between devices directly, enabling low-latency communication.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows developers to quickly implement P2P functionality in their apps.
- **Connection Management**: Handles connection states and provides callbacks for connection events.

## When to Use
You should consider using the `flutter_p2p_connection` package when:
- You need to transfer data between devices without a server.
- Your application requires real-time communication, such as in gaming or chat applications.
- You want to implement features like file sharing or collaborative tools.

In summary, the `flutter_p2p_connection` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement P2P communication in their Flutter applications.

# Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `flutter_p2p_connection` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_p2p_connection: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for location services:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to establish P2P connections.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to establish P2P connections.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initialize and use the `flutter_p2p_connection` package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_p2p_connection/flutter_p2p_connection.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Declare variables for P2P connection
  P2PConnection _p2pConnection;
  String _status = "Disconnected";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the P2P connection
    _p2pConnection = P2PConnection();
    _initializeP2P();
  }

  void _initializeP2P() async {
    // Start the P2P connection
    await _p2pConnection.start();
    // Set up listeners for connection events
    _p2pConnection.onConnectionStatusChanged.listen((status) {
      setState(() {
        _status = status;
      });
    });
  }

  void _sendMessage(String message) {
    // Send a message to connected peers
    _p2pConnection.sendMessage(message);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the P2P connection when the widget is removed
    _p2pConnection.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("P2P Connection Example")),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text("Connection Status: $_status"),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () => _sendMessage("Hello from P2P!"),
                child: Text("Send Message"),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
 
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the flutter_p2p_connection package.
// 
// 1. **Initialization**: The P2P connection is initialized in the `initState` method, where we start the connection and set up a listener for connection status changes.
// 
// 2. **Connection Status**: The connection status is displayed on the screen, updating whenever the status changes.
// 
// 3. **Sending Messages**: A button is provided to send a message to connected peers. The `_sendMessage` method is called when the button is pressed, sending a predefined message.
// 
// 4. **Disposal**: The P2P connection is disposed of in the `dispose` method to free up resources when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
// 
// In summary, this application establishes a P2P connection, displays the connection status, and allows sending messages to connected peers. The flow is straightforward, making it easy to expand upon for more complex functionalities.
