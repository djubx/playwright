void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override

          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              DiamondNodeSlider(
                value: _value,
                min: 0,
                max: 100,
                onChanged: (value) {
                  setState(() {
                    _value = value;
                  });
                },
              ),
              Text('Value: ${_value.round()}'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created and run.
// 2. The _RealFlutterState is initialized with a default value of 50.
// 3. The build method is called, creating the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 4. The DiamondNodeSlider is created and displayed, with the initial value of 50.
// 5. When the user interacts with the slider, the onChanged callback is called.
// 6. The setState method is called, updating the _value variable with the new value.
// 7. The build method is called again, updating the display with the new value.
// 8. The Text widget displays the updated value.

// Summary:
// The code creates a simple Flutter app with a DiamondNodeSlider.
// The slider's value is updated when the user interacts with it.
// The updated value is displayed on the screen.
```
