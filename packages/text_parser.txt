# Overview of the `text_parser` Flutter Package

The `text_parser` package is a powerful tool designed for parsing and manipulating text in Flutter applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to extract, format, and analyze text data, making it ideal for applications that require text processing, such as chat applications, note-taking apps, or any app that deals with user-generated content.

## When to Use `text_parser`

You might consider using the `text_parser` package in scenarios such as:
- **Chat Applications**: To parse and format messages, including mentions, hashtags, or links.
- **Note-Taking Apps**: To extract key information from user notes, such as dates, tasks, or important phrases.
- **Content Management Systems**: To analyze and format user-generated content for better readability and presentation.

## Key Features
- **Text Extraction**: Easily extract specific patterns or keywords from a block of text.
- **Formatting Options**: Apply various formatting styles to the parsed text, such as bold, italics, or color changes.
- **Customizable Parsing Rules**: Define your own rules for parsing text based on your application's needs.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, the `text_parser` package can significantly enhance the text handling capabilities of your Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `text_parser` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `text_parser` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  text_parser: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to parse a text string and apply some formatting.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_parser/text_parser.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample text to parse
    String sampleText = "Hello @user! Check out #Flutter and visit https://flutter.dev";

    // Parse the text
    List<TextSpan> parsedText = TextParser.parse(sampleText);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Text Parser Example')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: RichText(
          text: TextSpan(
            children: parsedText,
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black), // Default text color
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the `text_parser` package and use it to parse a sample text string. The parsed text is then displayed using a `RichText` widget.

# Complete Example of Using the `text_parser` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_parser/text_parser.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample text to parse
    String sampleText = "Hello @user! Check out #Flutter and visit https://flutter.dev";

    // Parse the text using the TextParser
    List<TextSpan> parsedText = TextParser.parse(sampleText);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Text Parser Example')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: RichText(
          text: TextSpan(
            children: parsedText,
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black), // Default text color
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which builds the UI.
// 3. A sample text string is defined, containing a mention, a hashtag, and a URL.
// 4. The TextParser.parse() method is called to parse the sample text into a list of TextSpan objects.
// 5. The parsed text is displayed in a RichText widget, allowing for different styles based on the parsed content.
// 6. The app is structured with a simple AppBar and a body that contains the parsed text, demonstrating the capabilities of the text_parser package.
