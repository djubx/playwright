# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Photo Editor SDK

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **photo_editor_sdk** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **photo_editor_sdk** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  photo_editor_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/photo_editor_sdk).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
        ...
    }
}
```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to edit photos.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Photo Editor SDK

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:photo_editor_sdk/photo_editor_sdk.dart';
```

2. Initialize the editor and present it to the user:

```dart
void openPhotoEditor(BuildContext context, String imagePath) async {
  final result = await PhotoEditorSDK.openEditor(
    context: context,
    image: imagePath,
  );

  if (result != null) {
    // Handle the edited image
  }
}
```

3. Call the `openPhotoEditor` function when you want to launch the editor, passing the context and the image path.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the **photo_editor_sdk** into your Flutter application and provide users with a robust photo editing experience.

# Complete Example of Using the Photo Editor SDK

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:photo_editor_sdk/photo_editor_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Photo Editor SDK Example',
      home: PhotoEditorHome(),
    );
  }
}

class PhotoEditorHome extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to open the photo editor
  void openPhotoEditor(BuildContext context) async {
    // Path to the image to be edited
    String imagePath = 'assets/sample_image.jpg'; // Ensure this image is in your assets

    // Open the photo editor
    final result = await PhotoEditorSDK.openEditor(
      context: context,
      image: imagePath,
    );

    // Check if the user edited the image
    if (result != null) {
      // Display the edited image
      showDialog(
        context: context,
        builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
          title: Text('Edited Image'),
          content: Image.memory(result), // Display the edited image
          actions: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
              child: Text('Close'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Photo Editor SDK Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => openPhotoEditor(context), // Open the editor on button press
          child: Text('Edit Photo'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The PhotoEditorHome widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. When the user taps the "Edit Photo" button, the openPhotoEditor function is called.
// 4. The photo editor is opened with the specified image path.
// 5. If the user edits the image and returns a result, an AlertDialog is shown displaying the edited image.
// 6. The user can close the dialog to return to the main screen.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that allows users to edit a photo using the **photo_editor_sdk**. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the app, displays a button to edit a photo, and opens the photo editor when the button is pressed. After editing, the edited image is displayed in a dialog.

### Final Summary
The **photo_editor_sdk** package provides a robust solution for integrating photo editing capabilities into Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions outlined in this blog, developers can easily implement a feature-rich photo editing experience that enhances user engagement and satisfaction.
