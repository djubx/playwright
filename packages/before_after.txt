# Tutorial: Setting Up the Before_After Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To use the **before_after** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  before_after: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:before_after/before_after.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package
You can now use the `BeforeAfter` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
BeforeAfter(
  beforeImage: AssetImage('assets/before.jpg'),
  afterImage: AssetImage('assets/after.jpg'),
  // Customize the slider as needed
)
```

With these steps, you are ready to use the **before_after** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Before_After Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:before_after/before_after.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Before After Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Before and After Image Comparison'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: BeforeAfter(
            beforeImage: AssetImage('assets/before.jpg'), // Load the before image
            afterImage: AssetImage('assets/after.jpg'),   // Load the after image
            // Customize the slider's appearance
            sliderColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the slider
            sliderHeight: 4.0,        // Height of the slider
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 4. The body of the scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, the BeforeAfter widget is used to display the before and after images.
// 6. The beforeImage and afterImage properties are set to load images from the assets.
// 7. The sliderColor and sliderHeight properties customize the appearance of the slider.
// 8. The user can interact with the slider to compare the two images visually.
```
