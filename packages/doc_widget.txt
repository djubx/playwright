# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Doc Widget Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `doc_widget` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  doc_widget: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/doc_widget).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to read external storage if you plan to load documents from the device. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to allow access to files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to load documents.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display a PDF document.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:doc_widget/doc_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Doc Widget Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Document Viewer'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DocWidget(
            filePath: 'assets/sample.pdf', // Path to your document
            // You can also use a URL to load documents from the web
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a PDF document using the `DocWidget`. The `filePath` can point to a local asset or a URL.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we covered how to set up the `doc_widget` package in your Flutter application, including platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS. We also demonstrated how to use the package to display a document in a simple Flutter app.

# Complete Example of Using the Doc Widget Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:doc_widget/doc_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Doc Widget Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Document Viewer'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // The DocWidget is used here to display the document
          child: DocWidget(
            filePath: 'assets/sample.pdf', // Path to your document
            // You can also use a URL to load documents from the web
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a title.
// 4. The home property of the MaterialApp is set to a Scaffold widget, which provides a basic structure for the app.
// 5. An AppBar is added to the Scaffold with the title 'Document Viewer'.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child.
// 7. The child of the Center widget is the DocWidget, which is responsible for displaying the document.
// 8. The filePath property of the DocWidget points to the document to be displayed, which can be a local asset or a URL.
// 9. Finally, the runApp function is called with an instance of RealFlutter to start the application.
