Here's a detailed technical blog on the "entry" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Entry Flutter Package

The **entry** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the management of application entry points and routing in Flutter applications. It provides a clean and efficient way to define and manage the entry points of your app, making it easier to handle complex navigation scenarios.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **entry** package when:
- You have a multi-page application with complex navigation requirements.
- You want to manage different entry points for various user roles or app states.
- You need to implement deep linking or handle specific routes based on user actions.

## Features

- **Flexible Routing**: Easily define multiple entry points and manage navigation between them.
- **Deep Linking Support**: Handle incoming links and route users to the appropriate screen.
- **Role-Based Navigation**: Customize navigation based on user roles or app states.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.

By leveraging the **entry** package, developers can create more maintainable and scalable Flutter applications with a clear structure for navigation and entry management.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Entry Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **entry** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **entry** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  entry: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following configuration to support deep linking:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>yourapp</string> <!-- Replace with your app's scheme -->
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Entry Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our application. Below is a simple example of how to define entry points and manage navigation.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:entry/entry.dart'; // Import the entry package

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Define the main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Entry Package Example',
      initialRoute: '/', // Set the initial route
      routes: {
        '/': (context) => HomeScreen(), // Home screen as the entry point
        '/details': (context) => DetailsScreen(), // Details screen
      },
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the details screen
            Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/details');
          },
          child: Text('Go to Details'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Details screen widget
class DetailsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Details')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is the details screen.'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with defined routes.
// 3. The initial route is set to '/', which leads to the HomeScreen.
// 4. HomeScreen displays a button that, when pressed, navigates to the DetailsScreen using Navigator.pushNamed().
// 5. DetailsScreen shows a simple message indicating that the user is on the details page.
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The app starts with the `main()` function, which initializes the Flutter app by calling `runApp(MyApp())`.
// 2. `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the `MaterialApp` with defined routes.
// 3. The initial route is set to `'/'`, which corresponds to the `HomeScreen`.
// 4. The `HomeScreen` contains a button that, when pressed, navigates to the `DetailsScreen` using `Navigator.pushNamed()`.
// 5. The `DetailsScreen` displays a simple message, indicating that the user has navigated to the details page.

In summary, the **entry** Flutter package provides a robust solution for managing application entry points and navigation. By following the setup and example provided, you can easily integrate this package into your Flutter applications, enhancing their structure and maintainability.
