# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Fade and Translate

## Installation
To use the **fade_and_translate** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fade_and_translate: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your animations involve any media or location services. However, for basic usage of the **fade_and_translate** package, no specific configurations are needed.

## Using the Package
To use the **fade_and_translate** package, you can wrap your widgets with the `FadeAndTranslate` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fade_and_translate/fade_and_translate.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fade and Translate Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: FadeAndTranslate(
          duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
          child: Text('Hello, Flutter!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the text "Hello, Flutter!" will fade in and translate into view when the widget is built.

# Complete Example of Fade and Translate

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fade_and_translate/fade_and_translate.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fade and Translate Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fade and Translate Example')),
      body: Center(
        // Using a Column to stack multiple FadeAndTranslate widgets
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            FadeAndTranslate(
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Animation duration
              child: Text('Welcome to Fade and Translate!'), // First text
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between texts
            FadeAndTranslate(
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 700), // Slightly longer duration
              child: Text('Enjoy smooth animations!'), // Second text
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between texts
            FadeAndTranslate(
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 900), // Even longer duration
              child: ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action when button is pressed
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Press Me'), // Button text
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. Inside the RealFlutter widget, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. A Column widget is used to stack multiple FadeAndTranslate widgets vertically.
// 5. Each FadeAndTranslate widget animates its child (text or button) with a fade and translate effect.
// 6. The button shows a SnackBar when pressed, demonstrating interactivity.
