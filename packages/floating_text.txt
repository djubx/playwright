import 'package:floating_text/floating_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Floating Text Demo',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Floating Text Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Create a floating text widget
            FloatingText(
              text: 'Hello, World!',
              textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.blue),
              position: Offset(100, 100),
              alignment: Alignment.center,
              animation: AnimationType.fadeIn,
            ),
            // Create a button to toggle the visibility of the floating text
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                setState(() {
                  // Toggle the visibility of the floating text
                });
              },
              child: Text('Toggle Visibility'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and sees the floating text on the screen.
// 2. The user clicks the "Toggle Visibility" button to toggle the visibility of the floating text.
// 3. The floating text is hidden or shown based on the current visibility state.
// 4. The user can adjust the position, alignment, and animation of the floating text by modifying the properties of the `FloatingText` widget.

// In summary, this code demonstrates how to use the `floating_text` package to display floating text on top of other widgets in a Flutter app. The user can toggle the visibility of the floating text by clicking a button, and the floating text can be customized in terms of its appearance, position, and animation.
