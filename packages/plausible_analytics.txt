# Tutorial: Setting Up Plausible Analytics in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **plausible_analytics** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **plausible_analytics** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  plausible_analytics: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure for Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your app has internet permissions. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, initialize the Plausible Analytics with your domain. This is typically done in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:plausible_analytics/plausible_analytics.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Plausible Analytics with your domain
  PlausibleAnalytics.initialize(domain: 'yourdomain.com');
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Track Events and Page Views

You can now track events and page views in your application. For example, to track a page view, you can use:

```dart
PlausibleAnalytics.trackPageView(path: '/home');
```

To track a custom event, use:

```dart
PlausibleAnalytics.trackEvent(name: 'button_click', props: {'button_name': 'subscribe'});
```

## Conclusion

You have now set up the **plausible_analytics** package in your Flutter application. You can track user interactions and page views while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.

# Complete Example of Plausible Analytics in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:plausible_analytics/plausible_analytics.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Plausible Analytics with your domain
  PlausibleAnalytics.initialize(domain: 'yourdomain.com');
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Plausible Analytics Demo',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Track the page view when the HomePage is built
    PlausibleAnalytics.trackPageView(path: '/home');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Plausible Analytics Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Track a custom event when the button is clicked
            PlausibleAnalytics.trackEvent(name: 'button_click', props: {'button_name': 'subscribe'});
            // Navigate to the next page
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondPage()),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Subscribe'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Track the page view when the SecondPage is built
    PlausibleAnalytics.trackPageView(path: '/second');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Second Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the second page!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts in the main() function, initializing Plausible Analytics with the specified domain.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp and the home page.
// 3. The HomePage widget is built, and a page view is tracked for the '/home' path.
// 4. The user sees a button labeled 'Subscribe'.
// 5. When the button is clicked, a custom event 'button_click' is tracked, and the app navigates to the SecondPage.
// 6. The SecondPage widget is built, and a page view is tracked for the '/second' path, displaying a welcome message.
```
