# Motion Flutter Package

The **motion** package for Flutter is a powerful tool designed to simplify the creation of animations and transitions in your Flutter applications. It provides a set of pre-built animations and motion effects that can be easily integrated into your app, enhancing the user experience with smooth and visually appealing transitions.

### When to Use the Motion Package

You should consider using the motion package when:
- You want to add animations to your app without writing complex animation code.
- You need to create smooth transitions between screens or widgets.
- You want to enhance user engagement through visual feedback.

### Key Features

- **Pre-built Animations**: The package includes a variety of pre-defined animations that can be easily applied to widgets.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the animations to fit your app's design and user experience.
- **Ease of Use**: The API is designed to be intuitive, making it easy for developers to implement animations without deep knowledge of Flutter's animation framework.
- **Performance Optimizations**: The package is optimized for performance, ensuring that animations run smoothly on both Android and iOS devices.

# Setting Up the Motion Package

To get started with the motion package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the motion package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  motion: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### For Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### For iOS

1. Open `ios/Podfile`.
2. Uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart files, import the motion package:

```dart
import 'package:motion/motion.dart';
```

### Step 5: Using the Motion Package

You can now start using the motion package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a fade-in animation using the `Motion` widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:motion/motion.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Motion Package Example',
      home: MotionExample(),
    );
  }
}

class MotionExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MotionExampleState createState() => _MotionExampleState();
}

class _MotionExampleState extends State<MotionExample> {
  // This variable controls the visibility of the animated widget
  bool _visible = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Motion Package Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Button to toggle the visibility of the animated widget
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                setState(() {
                  _visible = !_visible; // Toggle visibility
                });
              },
              child: Text('Toggle Animation'),
            ),
            // Using Motion widget to animate the visibility of the child
            Motion(
              visible: _visible,
              child: Container(
                width: 200,
                height: 200,
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Hello Motion!',
                    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              // Fade-in animation configuration
              animation: MotionAnimation.fadeIn,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to MotionExample.
// 3. MotionExample is a stateful widget that manages the visibility of a blue container.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _visible state variable toggles between true and false.
// 5. The Motion widget listens to the _visible variable and applies a fade-in animation when the container becomes visible.
// 6. The animated container displays the text "Hello Motion!" when visible, providing a smooth transition effect.
```

### Summary of Application Flow

The application begins by running the `RealFlutter` widget, which sets up a `MaterialApp`. The home screen is defined by the `MotionExample` widget, which contains a button to toggle the visibility of a blue container. When the button is pressed, the `_visible` state variable changes, triggering the `Motion` widget to animate the container's appearance with a fade-in effect. This simple example demonstrates how to integrate the motion package into a Flutter application, providing a foundation for more complex animations and transitions.
