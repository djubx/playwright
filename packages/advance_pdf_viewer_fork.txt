# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Advance PDF Viewer Fork

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `advance_pdf_viewer_fork` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `advance_pdf_viewer_fork` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  advance_pdf_viewer_fork: ^2.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest version
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.github.barteksc:android-pdf-viewer:3.2.0-beta.1' // or latest version
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # or latest version
```

Then, run `pod install` in the `ios` directory.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple Flutter application to display a PDF document.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:advance_pdf_viewer_fork/advance_pdf_viewer_fork.dart';
```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the PDF viewer:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  PDFDocument? document;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    loadPDF();
  }

  Future<void> loadPDF() async {
    document = await PDFDocument.fromAsset('assets/sample.pdf');
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Viewer'),
      ),
      body: document == null
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator())
          : PDFViewer(
              document: document!,
              scrollDirection: Axis.vertical,
              lazyLoad: false,
            ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, set the `RealFlutter` widget as the home in your `main.dart`:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(),
  ));
}
```

This setup will allow you to display a PDF document from your assets folder.

# Complete Example of Advance PDF Viewer Fork

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advance_pdf_viewer_fork/advance_pdf_viewer_fork.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(),
  ));
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  PDFDocument? document; // Variable to hold the PDF document

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    loadPDF(); // Load the PDF document when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to load the PDF document from assets
  Future<void> loadPDF() async {
    document = await PDFDocument.fromAsset('assets/sample.pdf'); // Load PDF from assets
    setState(() {}); // Update the state to refresh the UI
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Viewer'), // Title of the app bar
      ),
      body: document == null
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator while PDF is loading
          : PDFViewer(
              document: document!, // Pass the loaded document to the PDFViewer
              scrollDirection: Axis.vertical, // Set scroll direction to vertical
              lazyLoad: false, // Disable lazy loading for immediate rendering
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a stateful widget that manages the PDF document state.
// 3. In the initState method, loadPDF() is called to load the PDF document from the assets.
// 4. The loadPDF function uses PDFDocument.fromAsset to load the PDF and updates the state.
// 5. In the build method, if the document is null, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 6. Once the document is loaded, the PDFViewer widget is displayed, allowing users to view the PDF.
```
