# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Syncfusion Flutter DatePicker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `syncfusion_flutter_datepicker` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  syncfusion_flutter_datepicker: ^20.1.55
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires access to the user's calendar. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your calendar.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the DatePicker

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using the `SfDatePicker` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the date picker in your Flutter app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:syncfusion_flutter_datepicker/datepicker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Syncfusion DatePicker Demo',
      home: DatePickerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class DatePickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DatePickerDemoState createState() => _DatePickerDemoState();
}

class _DatePickerDemoState extends State<DatePickerDemo> {
  // Variable to hold the selected date
  DateTime? _selectedDate;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Syncfusion DatePicker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the selected date
            Text(
              _selectedDate == null
                  ? 'No date selected'
                  : 'Selected Date: ${_selectedDate!.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0],
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open the date picker
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Show the date picker dialog
                _showDatePicker();
              },
              child: Text('Select Date'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to show the date picker
  void _showDatePicker() {
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
        return AlertDialog(
          title: Text('Select a Date'),
          content: Container(
            width: double.maxFinite,
            child: SfDatePicker(
              onSelectionChanged: (DateRangePickerSelectionChangedArgs args) {
                // Update the selected date when a date is selected
                setState(() {
                  _selectedDate = args.value;
                });
                Navigator.pop(context); // Close the dialog
              },
              // Set the initial selected date
              initialSelectedDate: DateTime.now(),
              // Enable range selection
              selectionMode: DateRangePickerSelectionMode.single,
            ),
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the Syncfusion DatePicker.
// 
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app and sets `RealFlutter` as the root widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` class builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget, `DatePickerDemo`.
// 3. The `DatePickerDemo` class maintains the state of the selected date.
// 4. In the `build` method, it displays the selected date or a message indicating no date is selected.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is provided to open the date picker dialog when pressed.
// 6. The `_showDatePicker` function creates an AlertDialog containing the `SfDatePicker` widget.
// 7. The `onSelectionChanged` callback updates the `_selectedDate` variable when a date is selected and closes the dialog.
// 8. The date picker is initialized to the current date and allows single date selection.
```
