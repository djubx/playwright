# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Image Compare Slider

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `image_compare_slider` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_compare_slider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the image comparison slider.

# Complete Example of Image Compare Slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_compare_slider/image_compare_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Compare Slider Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Image Compare Slider'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ImageCompareSlider(
            // The first image to display
            firstImage: AssetImage('assets/before.jpg'),
            // The second image to display
            secondImage: AssetImage('assets/after.jpg'),
            // Optional: Set the initial position of the slider
            sliderPosition: 0.5,
            // Optional: Customize the slider's appearance
            sliderColor: Colors.blue,
            // Optional: Customize the background color
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Image Compare Slider'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers the ImageCompareSlider widget.
// 5. The ImageCompareSlider takes two images (before and after) and displays them side by side.
// 6. The user can drag the slider to compare the two images interactively.
// 7. Optional parameters allow customization of the slider's position, color, and background.
