# Overview of the `form_validation` Flutter Package

The `form_validation` package in Flutter is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of validating user input in forms. This package provides a set of pre-defined validators and the ability to create custom validators, making it easier to ensure that the data entered by users meets the required criteria before processing.

## When to Use `form_validation`

- **User Registration Forms**: Ensure that email addresses, passwords, and other fields meet specific criteria.
- **Login Forms**: Validate credentials before sending them to the server.
- **Data Entry Applications**: Check that numerical inputs fall within a specified range or that text fields are not left empty.
- **Survey Forms**: Validate responses to ensure completeness and correctness.

## Features

- **Pre-defined Validators**: Includes common validators such as email, required fields, and length checks.
- **Custom Validators**: Allows developers to define their own validation logic.
- **Integration with Form Widgets**: Easily integrates with Flutter's form widgets to provide real-time validation feedback.
- **Error Messaging**: Displays error messages when validation fails, guiding users to correct their input.

# Setting Up and Using the `form_validation` Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `form_validation` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `form_validation` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     form_validation: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package to use its features.

   ```dart
   import 'package:form_validation/form_validation.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support all features of the package.

### iOS

- No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Using the Package

1. **Create a Form**: Use Flutter's `Form` widget to create a form.

2. **Add Validators**: Use the validators provided by the package to validate form fields.

3. **Handle Validation**: Use a `GlobalKey<FormState>` to manage the form's state and validate inputs.

                MinLengthRule(6, 'Password must be at least 6 characters long'),
              ],
            ),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) {
                // If the form is valid, display a snackbar.
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Processing Data')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Submit'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` app.
// `RealFlutter` is a stateless widget that sets up the basic MaterialApp structure.
// The `ValidationForm` widget is a stateful widget that manages the form state.
// Inside `ValidationForm`, a `Form` widget is used to group form fields.
// Each `TextFormField` has a validator that uses the `Validator` class from the `form_validation` package.
// The `Validator` class takes a list of rules, such as `RequiredRule` and `EmailRule`, to validate input.
// When the submit button is pressed, the form's state is validated.
// If validation passes, a snackbar is shown to indicate successful processing.

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app initializes and displays a form with email and password fields.
// 2. Users input their data, and each field is validated in real-time.
// 3. Upon pressing the submit button, the form checks all validators.
// 4. If all validations pass, a snackbar message is displayed.
