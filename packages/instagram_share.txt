# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Instagram Share Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `instagram_share` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  instagram_share: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to share images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save images to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to share an image to Instagram.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:instagram_share/instagram_share.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Instagram Share Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Call the share function when the button is pressed
              InstagramShare.shareImage('path_to_your_image.jpg');
            },
            child: Text('Share to Instagram'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the app will attempt to share the specified image to Instagram.

# Complete Example of Instagram Share

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:instagram_share/instagram_share.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Instagram Share Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Call the share function when the button is pressed
              InstagramShare.shareImage('path_to_your_image.jpg');
            },
            child: Text('Share to Instagram'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the app structure.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 6. The InstagramShare.shareImage method is called with the path to the image to be shared.
// 7. This initiates the sharing process, allowing the user to share the image directly to Instagram.
```
