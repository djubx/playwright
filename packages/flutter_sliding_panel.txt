# flutter_sliding_panel: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To add the `flutter_sliding_panel` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_sliding_panel: ^latest_version
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_sliding_panel`, you can create a simple sliding panel as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sliding_panel/flutter_sliding_panel.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: SlidingPanelExample(),
    );
  }
}

class SlidingPanelExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SlidingPanelExampleState createState() => _SlidingPanelExampleState();
}

class _SlidingPanelExampleState extends State<SlidingPanelExample> {
  // Create a controller for the sliding panel
  final PanelController _panelController = PanelController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sliding Panel Example')),
      body: SlidingPanel(
        controller: _panelController,
        panel: Center(child: Text('This is the sliding panel')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Toggle the sliding panel
              _panelController.toggle();
            },
            child: Text('Open Sliding Panel'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple sliding panel that can be toggled by pressing a button. The `PanelController` is used to control the state of the panel.

# Complete Example of flutter_sliding_panel

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sliding_panel/flutter_sliding_panel.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: SlidingPanelExample(),
    );
  }
}

class SlidingPanelExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SlidingPanelExampleState createState() => _SlidingPanelExampleState();
}

class _SlidingPanelExampleState extends State<SlidingPanelExample> {
  // Create a controller for the sliding panel
  final PanelController _panelController = PanelController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sliding Panel Example')),
      body: SlidingPanel(
        controller: _panelController,
        panel: Center(child: Text('This is the sliding panel')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Toggle the sliding panel
              _panelController.toggle();
            },
            child: Text('Open Sliding Panel'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which initializes the MaterialApp.
// 2. The SlidingPanelExample widget is set as the home of the app.
// 3. Inside SlidingPanelExample, we create a PanelController to manage the sliding panel's state.
// 4. The SlidingPanel widget is used to create the sliding interface, with a panel and body defined.
// 5. The panel contains a simple text widget, while the body has a button to toggle the panel.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the toggle method of the PanelController is called, which opens or closes the sliding panel.
