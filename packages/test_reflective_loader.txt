// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The main function is called, which defines the reflective suite.
// 2. The reflective suite defines the reflective tests.
// 3. The reflective tests define the test class.
// 4. The test class defines the test method.
// 5. The test method calls the someMethod method.
// 6. The someMethod method prints a message to the console.
// 7. The testRealFlutter function is called, which creates an instance of the RealFlutterTest class.
// 8. The testRealFlutter function calls the testSomeMethod method.
// 9. The runTests function is called, which calls the testRealFlutter function.

// The final summary is as follows:
// The code defines a reflective suite, which defines a reflective test.
// The reflective test defines a test class, which defines a test method.
// The test method calls a method on the RealFlutter class.
// The method on the RealFlutter class prints a message to the console.
// The testRealFlutter function creates an instance of the RealFlutterTest class and calls the testSomeMethod method.
// The runTests function calls the testRealFlutter function.
