# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Fontresoft

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Fontresoft package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the Fontresoft package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fontresoft: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Configuring Fonts

Next, you need to configure the fonts you want to use in your application. In the `pubspec.yaml` file, specify the font files under the `fonts` section. For example:

```yaml
flutter:
  fonts:
    - family: CustomFont
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/CustomFont-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/CustomFont-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
```

Make sure to place your font files in the specified directory (e.g., `fonts/`).

## Step 3: Using Fontresoft in Your Application

Now that you have set up the package and configured your fonts, you can start using Fontresoft in your Flutter application. Here’s how to do it:

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configuration:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, make sure to add the font files to your Xcode project. Open your project in Xcode, drag the font files into the project navigator, and ensure they are included in the "Copy Bundle Resources" section.

## Step 4: Example Usage

You can now use the Fontresoft package in your Flutter widgets. Here’s a simple example of how to apply custom fonts:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fontresoft/fontresoft.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fontresoft Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Fontresoft Example', style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'CustomFont')),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, Fontresoft!', style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'CustomFont', fontSize: 24)),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to apply the custom font to the app bar and body text.

# Complete Example of Fontresoft in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fontresoft/fontresoft.dart'; // Importing the Fontresoft package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Starting the application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fontresoft Example', // Title of the application
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Fontresoft Example', style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'CustomFont')), // Using custom font in AppBar
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Hello, Fontresoft!', // Main text
                style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'CustomFont', fontSize: 24), // Applying custom font
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between texts
              Text(
                'This is a demonstration of custom fonts.', // Secondary text
                style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'CustomFont', fontSize: 18), // Applying custom font
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() to start the app.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold, which provides the structure for the app.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title using a custom font defined in the pubspec.yaml.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the text widgets vertically.
// 7. Each Text widget applies the custom font and displays different messages.
// 8. The SizedBox widget adds spacing between the two text widgets for better readability.
```
