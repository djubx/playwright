# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Responsive UI Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **responsive_ui** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  responsive_ui: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

To use the **responsive_ui** package, you can import it into your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:responsive_ui/responsive_ui.dart';
```

You can then use the provided widgets to create responsive layouts. For example, you can use `ResponsiveBuilder` to build different layouts based on the screen size.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the package:

```dart
ResponsiveBuilder(
  builder: (context, sizingInformation) {
    if (sizingInformation.isMobile) {
      return MobileLayout();
    } else {
      return TabletLayout();
    }
  },
);
```

This code snippet checks if the device is mobile or tablet and returns the appropriate layout.

# Complete Example of Responsive UI in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_ui/responsive_ui.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Responsive UI Example',
      home: ResponsiveBuilder(
        builder: (context, sizingInformation) {
          // Check if the device is mobile or tablet
          if (sizingInformation.isMobile) {
            return MobileLayout(); // Return mobile layout
          } else {
            return TabletLayout(); // Return tablet layout
          }
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Mobile layout widget
class MobileLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mobile Layout')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is a mobile layout', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Tablet layout widget
class TabletLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Tablet Layout')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is a tablet layout', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 32)),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home property.
// 3. The home property uses ResponsiveBuilder to determine the device type.
// 4. Depending on whether the device is mobile or tablet, it returns either MobileLayout or TabletLayout.
// 5. Each layout has its own Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered Text widget indicating the layout type.
```
