# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Agora RTC Engine

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `agora_rtc_engine` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  agora_rtc_engine: ^5.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the following permissions and metadata in your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"/>

<application>
    <meta-data
        android:name="io.agora.rtc.sdk.AppId"
        android:value="YOUR_AGORA_APP_ID"/> <!-- Replace with your Agora App ID -->
</application>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio calls.</string>
<key>io.agora.rtc.sdk.AppId</key>
<string>YOUR_AGORA_APP_ID</string> <!-- Replace with your Agora App ID -->
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to initialize the Agora RTC Engine and join a channel.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:agora_rtc_engine/agora_rtc_engine.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late AgoraRtcEngine _engine;
  final String appId = "YOUR_AGORA_APP_ID"; // Replace with your Agora App ID
  final String channelName = "test_channel"; // Channel name for the call

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    initializeAgora();
  }

  Future<void> initializeAgora() async {
    _engine = await AgoraRtcEngine.create(appId);
    await _engine.enableVideo();
    await _engine.joinChannel(null, channelName, null, 0);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _engine.leaveChannel();
    _engine.destroy();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Agora RTC Engine")),
      body: Center(child: Text("In Call")),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the Agora RTC Engine, enable video, and join a channel. Make sure to replace `YOUR_AGORA_APP_ID` with your actual Agora App ID.

## Step 4: Running the Application
Run your application on a physical device or emulator. Ensure that you have a stable internet connection to test the real-time communication features effectively.

This tutorial provides a basic setup for using the `agora_rtc_engine` package in a Flutter application. You can expand upon this by adding more features such as handling user events, displaying remote video streams, and managing call states.

# Complete Example of Agora RTC Engine in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:agora_rtc_engine/agora_rtc_engine.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late AgoraRtcEngine _engine; // Declare the Agora RTC Engine
  final String appId = "YOUR_AGORA_APP_ID"; // Replace with your Agora App ID
  final String channelName = "test_channel"; // Channel name for the call

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    initializeAgora(); // Initialize the Agora RTC Engine
  }

  // Function to initialize the Agora RTC Engine
  Future<void> initializeAgora() async {
    _engine = await AgoraRtcEngine.create(appId); // Create the engine
    await _engine.enableVideo(); // Enable video
    await _engine.joinChannel(null, channelName, null, 0); // Join the channel
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _engine.leaveChannel(); // Leave the channel on dispose
    _engine.destroy(); // Destroy the engine
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Agora RTC Engine")), // App bar title
      body: Center(child: Text("In Call")), // Display a simple message
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, we call initializeAgora to set up the Agora RTC Engine.
// 3. The initializeAgora function creates the engine, enables video, and joins a specified channel.
// 4. When the widget is disposed, we leave the channel and destroy the engine to free up resources.
// 5. The UI consists of a simple Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered text indicating that the user is in a call.
