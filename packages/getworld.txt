# Overview of the getworld Flutter Package

The `getworld` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to manage and retrieve world-related data, such as geographical information, country details, and more. This package simplifies the process of accessing and displaying world data in your Flutter applications, making it an excellent choice for apps that require geographical context or data visualization.

## When to Use `getworld`

- **Geographical Applications**: If you're building an app that requires geographical data, such as a travel app or a world map application, `getworld` can provide the necessary data.
- **Educational Apps**: For applications aimed at teaching geography or world facts, this package can serve as a reliable data source.
- **Data Visualization**: If your app involves displaying world data in charts or maps, `getworld` can help you fetch the required information efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Easy Data Retrieval**: Fetch data about countries, continents, and other geographical entities with simple API calls.
- **Comprehensive Data**: Access a wide range of information, including population, area, languages, and currencies.
- **Lightweight**: The package is designed to be lightweight, ensuring minimal impact on your app's performance.
- **Well-Documented**: Comes with extensive documentation to help developers integrate it seamlessly into their projects.

# Setting Up and Using the getworld Package

## Installation

To get started with the `getworld` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  getworld: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires location services or internet access. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your location.</string>
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package

To use the `getworld` package, you can import it into your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:getworld/getworld.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class to start fetching world data. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve and display country information.

# Complete Example of Using getworld

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:getworld/getworld.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'GetWorld Example',
      home: CountryListScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CountryListScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountryListScreenState createState() => _CountryListScreenState();
}

class _CountryListScreenState extends State<CountryListScreen> {
  List<Country> countries = []; // List to hold country data
  bool isLoading = true; // Loading state

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    fetchCountries(); // Fetch countries when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to fetch country data
  Future<void> fetchCountries() async {
    try {
      countries = await GetWorld.getCountries(); // Fetch countries using getworld
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error fetching countries: $e'); // Handle any errors
    } finally {
      setState(() {
        isLoading = false; // Update loading state
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Countries of the World'), // App title
      ),
      body: isLoading
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: countries.length, // Number of countries
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                final country = countries[index]; // Get country data
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(country.name), // Display country name
                  subtitle: Text('Population: ${country.population}'), // Display population
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets CountryListScreen as the home.
// 3. CountryListScreen is a stateful widget that initializes a list to hold country data and a loading state.
// 4. In the initState method, fetchCountries is called to retrieve the list of countries.
// 5. fetchCountries uses the getworld package to fetch country data asynchronously.
// 6. If successful, the countries list is populated, and the loading state is updated.
// 7. The build method displays a loading indicator while data is being fetched.
// 8. Once data is available, a ListView is built to display the country names and populations.
