Here’s a detailed technical blog on the `sealed_annotations` Flutter package, structured as requested.

# Sealed Annotations in Flutter: A Comprehensive Guide

The `sealed_annotations` package in Flutter is a powerful tool that allows developers to create sealed classes and unions in Dart. This package is particularly useful for managing state in applications, as it provides a way to define a limited set of subclasses for a given class, enhancing type safety and reducing runtime errors.

## When to Use `sealed_annotations`

You should consider using `sealed_annotations` when:
- You want to implement a state management solution that requires a clear and concise representation of states.
- You need to define a set of related classes that share a common interface but have distinct implementations.
- You want to leverage the benefits of exhaustive checks in switch statements, ensuring that all possible cases are handled.

## Features of `sealed_annotations`

- **Sealed Classes**: Define a class that cannot be instantiated directly but can have subclasses.
- **Union Types**: Create a type that can be one of several different types, enhancing flexibility in your code.
- **Code Generation**: Automatically generate the necessary boilerplate code for sealed classes and unions, reducing manual coding effort.

By using `sealed_annotations`, you can create cleaner, more maintainable code that adheres to best practices in Dart and Flutter development.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `sealed_annotations`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `sealed_annotations`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following lines:

```yaml
dependencies:
  sealed_annotations: ^0.1.0

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.0.0
  sealed_generator: ^0.1.0
```

## Step 2: Running Build Runner

After adding the dependencies, run the following command in your terminal to generate the necessary code:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This command will generate the code for your sealed classes based on the annotations you use in your Dart files.

## Step 3: Creating Sealed Classes

Now, let’s create a sealed class using the `sealed_annotations` package. Create a new Dart file, for example, `state.dart`, and define your sealed classes as follows:

```dart
import 'package:sealed_annotations/sealed_annotations.dart';

part 'state.g.dart';

@Sealed()
abstract class AppState {
  const AppState();
}

@Sealed()
class Loading extends AppState {}

@Sealed()
class Loaded extends AppState {
  final String data;
  const Loaded(this.data);
}

@Sealed()
class ErrorState extends AppState {
  final String message;
  const ErrorState(this.message);
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
- **iOS**: Make sure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`.

## Step 4: Using Sealed Classes in Your Application

You can now use the sealed classes in your application. For example, you can manage the state of a widget based on the current `AppState`. Here’s how you might implement this in your main application file.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'state.dart'; // Import the file where sealed classes are defined

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sealed Annotations Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  // Initialize the current state as Loading
  AppState _currentState = Loading();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Simulate a data fetch
    _fetchData();
  }

  // Simulate a data fetch with a delay
  Future<void> _fetchData() async {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
    // Update the state to Loaded with some data
    setState(() {
      _currentState = Loaded("Hello, World!");
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Use a switch statement to handle different states
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sealed Annotations Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: _buildContent(),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Build content based on the current state
  Widget _buildContent() {
    switch (_currentState.runtimeType) {
      case Loading:
        return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator
      case Loaded:
        final loadedState = _currentState as Loaded; // Cast to Loaded
        return Text(loadedState.data); // Display loaded data
      case ErrorState:
        final errorState = _currentState as ErrorState; // Cast to ErrorState
        return Text('Error: ${errorState.message}'); // Display error message
      default:
        return Text('Unknown state'); // Fallback for unknown states
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The HomePage widget is created, initializing the state to Loading.
// 3. In initState, the _fetchData method is called to simulate data fetching.
// 4. After a 2-second delay, the state is updated to Loaded with a message.
// 5. The build method uses a switch statement to render different UI based on the current state.
// 6. If the state is Loading, a CircularProgressIndicator is shown.
// 7. If the state is Loaded, the data is displayed.
// 8. If the state is ErrorState, an error message is shown.
```
