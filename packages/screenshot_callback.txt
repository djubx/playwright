# Screenshot Callback Flutter Package

The `screenshot_callback` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the capturing of screenshots within your Flutter applications. This package allows developers to take screenshots of specific widgets or the entire screen, making it ideal for applications that require visual feedback, such as social media apps, reporting tools, or any app that benefits from sharing visual content.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `screenshot_callback` package in scenarios such as:
- **Social Media Applications**: Allow users to capture and share their posts or profiles.
- **Reporting Tools**: Enable users to take screenshots of reports or data visualizations for sharing or documentation.
- **Games**: Capture gameplay moments for sharing on social platforms.

## Features

- **Widget-Specific Screenshots**: Capture screenshots of specific widgets rather than the entire screen.
- **Callback Functionality**: Utilize callbacks to handle the screenshot data, allowing for custom processing or storage.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

This package enhances user experience by providing a straightforward way to capture and utilize screenshots within your Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Screenshot Callback Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `screenshot_callback` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  screenshot_callback: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow access to the photo library if you plan to save screenshots:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save screenshots.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Here’s how to implement it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:screenshot_callback/screenshot_callback.dart';
```

2. Use the `ScreenshotCallback` widget to wrap the widget you want to capture.

3. Implement the callback to handle the screenshot data.

Here’s a simple example of how to use the package in your application.

# Complete Example of Using Screenshot Callback

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:screenshot_callback/screenshot_callback.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Screenshot Callback Example',
      home: ScreenshotExample(),
    );
  }
}

class ScreenshotExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ScreenshotExampleState createState() => _ScreenshotExampleState();
}

class _ScreenshotExampleState extends State<ScreenshotExample> {
  // This variable will hold the screenshot image data
  Uint8List? _imageData;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Screenshot Callback Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ScreenshotCallback(
          // The callback function that will be called with the screenshot data
          onScreenshot: (Uint8List image) {
            setState(() {
              _imageData = image; // Store the screenshot data
            });
          },
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Display the screenshot image if available
              if (_imageData != null)
                Image.memory(_imageData!),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Trigger the screenshot capture
                  ScreenshotCallback.takeScreenshot();
                },
                child: Text('Take Screenshot'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (ScreenshotExample).
// 3. ScreenshotExample is a stateful widget that manages the screenshot functionality.
// 4. The ScreenshotCallback widget wraps the UI components that we want to capture.
// 5. When the "Take Screenshot" button is pressed, the takeScreenshot method is called.
// 6. The screenshot data is passed to the onScreenshot callback, where it is stored in _imageData.
// 7. If _imageData is not null, the captured screenshot is displayed using Image.memory.
