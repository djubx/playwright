# Flutter Map Marker Popup Package

The `flutter_map_marker_popup` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance their mapping applications with interactive marker popups. Built on top of the popular `flutter_map` package, it allows developers to easily create and manage popups that appear when users interact with map markers. This package is particularly useful for applications that require location-based information, such as travel apps, real estate listings, or any app that utilizes geographical data.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using `flutter_map_marker_popup` when:
- You need to display additional information about a location when a user taps on a map marker.
- You want to create a more interactive user experience in your mapping application.
- You are already using `flutter_map` and want to extend its functionality with popups.

## Features

- **Customizable Popups**: You can easily customize the content and appearance of the popups.
- **Integration with flutter_map**: Seamlessly integrates with the `flutter_map` package, leveraging its capabilities.
- **Support for Multiple Markers**: Handles multiple markers on the map, each with its own popup.
- **Responsive Design**: Popups are designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

Overall, `flutter_map_marker_popup` is an essential package for any Flutter developer looking to create engaging and informative mapping applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_map_marker_popup

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_map_marker_popup` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, you need to add the necessary dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Make sure to include both `flutter_map` and `flutter_map_marker_popup`.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_map: ^0.14.0
  flutter_map_marker_popup: ^0.12.0
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for internet access and location services. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you need to add location permissions in your `Info.plist` file. Include the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby markers.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby markers.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the dependencies and configurations, let's create a simple map with markers and popups.

1. Import the necessary packages in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map/flutter_map.dart';
import 'package:flutter_map_marker_popup/flutter_map_marker_popup.dart';
import 'package:latlong2/latlong.dart';
```

2. Create a `RealFlutter` class that extends `StatelessWidget` and build the map with markers and popups.

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Map Marker Popup Example')),
      body: FlutterMap(
        options: MapOptions(
          center: LatLng(51.5, -0.09), // Center of the map
          zoom: 13.0, // Initial zoom level
        ),
        layers: [
          TileLayerOptions(
            urlTemplate: "https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
            subdomains: ['a', 'b', 'c'],
          ),
          MarkerLayerOptions(
            markers: [
              Marker(
                point: LatLng(51.5, -0.09),
                builder: (ctx) => Icon(Icons.location_on, color: Colors.red),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application to see the map with a marker.

This basic setup will display a map with a single marker. You can expand this by adding more markers and configuring popups as needed.

}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 2. The body contains a FlutterMap widget, which is configured with options for center and zoom level.
// 3. The TileLayerOptions fetches map tiles from OpenStreetMap.
// 4. MarkerLayerOptions defines the markers to be displayed on the map.
// 5. PopupMarkerLayerOptions defines the markers that will show popups when tapped.
// 6. Each marker has a corresponding popup that displays additional information about the location.
// 7. The app is interactive, allowing users to tap on markers to view more details.
