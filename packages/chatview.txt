# Tutorial: Setting Up ChatView in Your Flutter Project

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started with the ChatView package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  chatview: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/chatview).

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the ChatView, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:chatview/chatview.dart';
```

## Step 5: Basic Usage

You can now use the ChatView widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ChatView(
  messages: messages, // List of messages to display
  onSend: (message) {
    // Handle sending a message
  },
  user: currentUser, // Current user information
);
```

This basic setup will allow you to display messages and handle user input. You can further customize the ChatView by modifying its properties.

# Complete Example of ChatView in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chatview/chatview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'ChatView Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ChatScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ChatScreenState createState() => _ChatScreenState();
}

class _ChatScreenState extends State<ChatScreen> {
  // List to hold messages
  List<Message> messages = [];
  // Current user information
  User currentUser = User(id: 'user1', name: 'John Doe');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chat Example'),
      ),
      body: ChatView(
        messages: messages, // Pass the list of messages
        onSend: (message) {
          // Handle sending a message
          setState(() {
            messages.add(Message(
              text: message,
              sender: currentUser,
              timestamp: DateTime.now(),
            ));
          });
        },
        user: currentUser, // Pass the current user
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets ChatScreen as the home.
// 3. ChatScreen is a stateful widget that maintains a list of messages and the current user.
// 4. In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a ChatView widget.
// 5. The ChatView displays the messages and handles sending new messages.
// 6. When a message is sent, it is added to the messages list, and the UI is updated using setState.
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// - The app starts with the `main` function, which runs `MyApp`.
// - `MyApp` sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home screen as `ChatScreen`.
// - `ChatScreen` maintains a list of messages and the current user.
// - The `ChatView` widget is used to display messages and handle user input.
// - When a user sends a message, it is added to the messages list, and the UI updates to reflect the new message.
