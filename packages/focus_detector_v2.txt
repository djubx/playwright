# Focus Detector V2 Flutter Package

The **focus_detector_v2** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers manage and respond to focus changes in their applications. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where user engagement is critical, such as in educational apps, games, or any application that requires user attention.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the **focus_detector_v2** package in the following scenarios:

- **Educational Applications**: To track whether a user is actively looking at the app or has switched focus to another application.
- **Gaming**: To pause or modify game behavior based on whether the user is still engaged.
- **Surveys and Forms**: To ensure that users are focused on completing tasks without distractions.

## Features

- **Focus Detection**: Detects when the app gains or loses focus.
- **Callbacks**: Provides callbacks for when focus changes, allowing developers to implement custom logic.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

With these features, the **focus_detector_v2** package enhances user experience by allowing developers to create more interactive and responsive applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Focus Detector V2

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **focus_detector_v2** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  focus_detector_v2: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Typically, no special permissions are required for focus detection, but ensure your app's minimum SDK version is set appropriately.

```xml
<uses-sdk
    android:minSdkVersion="21"
    android:targetSdkVersion="30" />
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add specific configurations in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires background execution or other specific capabilities. However, for basic focus detection, no additional configurations are necessary.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement focus detection.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:focus_detector_v2/focus_detector_v2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: FocusDetector(
        onFocusGained: () {
          print("Focus Gained");
        },
        onFocusLost: () {
          print("Focus Lost");
        },
        child: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Focus Detector Example")),
          body: Center(child: Text("Focus on this app!")),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, the `FocusDetector` widget wraps the main content of the app. It provides two callbacks: `onFocusGained` and `onFocusLost`, which are triggered when the app gains or loses focus, respectively.

# Complete Example of Focus Detector V2

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:focus_detector_v2/focus_detector_v2.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: FocusDetector(
        // Callback when the app gains focus
        onFocusGained: () {
          print("Focus Gained"); // Log focus gained
        },
        // Callback when the app loses focus
        onFocusLost: () {
          print("Focus Lost"); // Log focus lost
        },
        child: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Focus Detector Example")),
          body: Center(
            child: Text("Focus on this app!"), // Main content
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp containing a FocusDetector.
// 3. The FocusDetector listens for focus changes and triggers the appropriate callbacks.
// 4. When the app gains focus, "Focus Gained" is printed to the console.
// 5. When the app loses focus, "Focus Lost" is printed to the console.
// 6. The user interface consists of a simple AppBar and a centered text widget prompting the user to focus on the app.
