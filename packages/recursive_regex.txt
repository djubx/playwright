Here's a detailed technical blog on the "recursive_regex" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Recursive Regex Flutter Package

The `recursive_regex` package for Flutter is a powerful tool designed to handle complex regular expressions that require recursive patterns. This package is particularly useful for parsing nested structures, such as HTML, XML, or any other format where elements can be nested within each other. 

## When to Use

You should consider using the `recursive_regex` package when:
- You need to parse nested data formats.
- You are working with languages or formats that have recursive grammar.
- You want to simplify the process of matching complex patterns without writing extensive parsing logic.

## Features

- **Recursive Pattern Matching**: Allows for matching patterns that can contain nested structures.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to add to your Flutter project with minimal setup.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Designed to handle large inputs efficiently.

## Example Use Cases

1. **HTML Parsing**: Extracting nested tags from HTML documents.
2. **Configuration Files**: Parsing nested configuration formats like JSON or YAML.
3. **Custom Data Formats**: Any custom format that requires recursive parsing.

By leveraging the `recursive_regex` package, developers can significantly reduce the complexity of their code while improving maintainability and readability.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Recursive Regex

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `recursive_regex` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  recursive_regex: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package as follows:

```dart
import 'package:recursive_regex/recursive_regex.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `recursive_regex` package to match nested parentheses:

```dart
void main() {
  final regex = RecursiveRegex(r'\((?:[^()]+|(?R))*\)');
  final input = 'This is a test (with (nested) parentheses) and (another one)';
  
  final matches = regex.allMatches(input);
  for (var match in matches) {
    print(match.group(0)); // Outputs the matched nested parentheses
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a `RecursiveRegex` object with a pattern that matches nested parentheses. The `allMatches` method returns all occurrences of the pattern in the input string.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `recursive_regex` package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of Recursive Regex in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:recursive_regex/recursive_regex.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Recursive Regex Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Recursive Regex Demo'),
        ),
        body: RegexDemo(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RegexDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample input string with nested parentheses
    final input = 'This is a test (with (nested) parentheses) and (another one)';
    
    // Create a RecursiveRegex object with a pattern for nested parentheses
    final regex = RecursiveRegex(r'\((?:[^()]+|(?R))*\)');
    
    // Find all matches in the input string
    final matches = regex.allMatches(input);
    
    // Display the matches in a ListView
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: matches.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        return ListTile(
          title: Text(matches.elementAt(index).group(0) ?? ''),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold containing an AppBar and body.
// 3. The RegexDemo widget is responsible for demonstrating the recursive regex functionality.
// 4. Inside RegexDemo, we define a sample input string that contains nested parentheses.
// 5. We create a RecursiveRegex object with a regex pattern designed to match nested parentheses.
// 6. We call allMatches() on the regex object to find all occurrences of the pattern in the input string.
// 7. The matches are displayed in a ListView, where each match is shown as a ListTile.
// 8. The app provides a simple UI to visualize the results of the regex matching.
```
