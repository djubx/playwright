# flutter_gromore_ads: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_gromore_ads` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the `flutter_gromore_ads` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_gromore_ads: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gromore_ads).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the necessary permissions and metadata for Gromore ads:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <!-- Add this line -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.gromore.ads.APP_ID"
            android:value="YOUR_GROMORE_APP_ID"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following configuration:

```xml
<key>GromoreAppID</key>
<string>YOUR_GROMORE_APP_ID</string>
```

## Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_gromore_ads/flutter_gromore_ads.dart';
```

2. Initialize the Gromore ads in your main application file:

```dart
void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  GromoreAds.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

3. Display a banner ad:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Gromore Ads Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('Welcome to Gromore Ads!'),
              GromoreBannerAd(
                adUnitId: 'YOUR_BANNER_AD_UNIT_ID',
                listener: (event) {
                  // Handle ad events here
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

With these steps, you can successfully integrate Gromore ads into your Flutter application. Make sure to replace `YOUR_GROMORE_APP_ID` and `YOUR_BANNER_AD_UNIT_ID` with your actual Gromore credentials.

# Complete Example of flutter_gromore_ads

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gromore_ads/flutter_gromore_ads.dart';

void main() {
  // Ensure Flutter binding is initialized before using any plugins
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize Gromore Ads with your app ID
  GromoreAds.initialize();
  
  // Run the main application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gromore Ads Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Gromore Ads Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('Welcome to Gromore Ads!'),
              // Displaying a banner ad
              GromoreBannerAd(
                adUnitId: 'YOUR_BANNER_AD_UNIT_ID', // Replace with your ad unit ID
                listener: (event) {
                  // Handle ad events such as loading, failed to load, etc.
                  if (event == GromoreAdEvent.loaded) {
                    print('Banner Ad Loaded');
                  } else if (event == GromoreAdEvent.failedToLoad) {
                    print('Banner Ad Failed to Load');
                  }
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Show an interstitial ad when the button is pressed
                  GromoreInterstitialAd.show('YOUR_INTERSTITIAL_AD_UNIT_ID');
                },
                child: Text('Show Interstitial Ad'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter binding and Gromore Ads.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is the main application widget.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. A banner ad is displayed using GromoreBannerAd, with a listener to handle ad events.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is provided to show an interstitial ad when pressed.
// 6. The listener for the banner ad logs messages based on the ad's loading state.
