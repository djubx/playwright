# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_image_clipboard

### Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `flutter_image_clipboard` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_image_clipboard: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_image_clipboard).

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application
        android:label="yourapp"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        ...
    </application>

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
</manifest>
```

#### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for accessing the clipboard:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to paste images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take pictures.</string>
```

### Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to access and display an image from the clipboard.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_image_clipboard/flutter_image_clipboard.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Image Clipboard Demo',
      home: ImageClipboardDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class ImageClipboardDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImageClipboardDemoState createState() => _ImageClipboardDemoState();
}

class _ImageClipboardDemoState extends State<ImageClipboardDemo> {
  // Variable to hold the image retrieved from the clipboard
  Image? _clipboardImage;

  // Function to retrieve the image from the clipboard
  Future<void> _getImageFromClipboard() async {
    // Attempt to get the image from the clipboard
    final image = await FlutterImageClipboard.getImage();
    // Check if an image was retrieved
    if (image != null) {
      setState(() {
        // Update the state with the new image
        _clipboardImage = image;
      });
    } else {
      // Show an error message if no image was found
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('No image found in clipboard')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Clipboard Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the image if it exists
            _clipboardImage != null
                ? Image(image: _clipboardImage!)
                : Text('No image in clipboard'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _getImageFromClipboard,
              child: Text('Paste Image from Clipboard'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to ImageClipboardDemo.
// 3. ImageClipboardDemo is a stateful widget that manages the state of the clipboard image.
// 4. The _getImageFromClipboard function is called when the button is pressed.
// 5. This function uses the FlutterImageClipboard package to retrieve an image from the clipboard.
// 6. If an image is found, it updates the state to display the image; otherwise, it shows an error message.
// 7. The UI consists of a button to trigger the paste action and a display area for the image.
```
