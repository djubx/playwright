# Tutorial: Setting Up Adyen Checkout in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **adyen_checkout** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **adyen_checkout** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  adyen_checkout: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, import the package and initialize it:

```dart
import 'package:adyen_checkout/adyen_checkout.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Implement Payment Flow

You can now implement the payment flow using the **adyen_checkout** package. The following sections will guide you through creating a simple payment interface.

# Complete Example: Adyen Checkout in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adyen_checkout/adyen_checkout.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Adyen Checkout Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  // Initialize the Adyen Checkout object
  late AdyenCheckout adyenCheckout;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Create an instance of AdyenCheckout
    adyenCheckout = AdyenCheckout(
      clientKey: 'YOUR_CLIENT_KEY', // Replace with your Adyen client key
      environment: Environment.test, // Use Environment.live for production
    );
  }

  // Function to start the payment process
  void startPayment() async {
    // Create a payment request
    final paymentRequest = PaymentRequest(
      amount: Amount(value: 1000, currency: 'EUR'), // Amount in cents
      reference: 'YOUR_ORDER_REFERENCE', // Unique order reference
      returnUrl: 'YOUR_RETURN_URL', // URL to return after payment
    );

    // Start the payment process
    final result = await adyenCheckout.startPayment(paymentRequest);

    // Handle the payment result
    if (result.isSuccess) {
      // Payment was successful
      showDialog(
        context: context,
        builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
          title: Text('Payment Successful'),
          content: Text('Your payment was successful!'),
          actions: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
              child: Text('OK'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      );
    } else {
      // Payment failed
      showDialog(
        context: context,
        builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
          title: Text('Payment Failed'),
          content: Text('Your payment could not be processed.'),
          actions: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
              child: Text('OK'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Adyen Checkout'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: startPayment, // Start payment on button press
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The PaymentScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. In the PaymentScreen, we initialize the AdyenCheckout object with the client key and environment.
// 4. When the user presses the "Pay Now" button, the startPayment function is called.
// 5. A payment request is created with the amount, currency, reference, and return URL.
// 6. The payment process is initiated, and the result is awaited.
// 7. Depending on the result, a dialog is shown to inform the user whether the payment was successful or failed.
```
