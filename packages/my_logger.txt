# my_logger Flutter Package

The `my_logger` package is a lightweight logging utility designed for Flutter applications. It provides developers with a simple and effective way to log messages, errors, and other important information during the development and debugging process. This package is particularly useful when you need to track application behavior, diagnose issues, or simply keep a record of events.

## When to Use `my_logger`
- **Debugging**: Capture logs during development to troubleshoot issues.
- **Error Tracking**: Log errors and exceptions to monitor application health.
- **Event Logging**: Record user interactions or significant events for analytics.

## Features
- **Custom Log Levels**: Define different levels of logging (e.g., info, warning, error).
- **File Logging**: Optionally log messages to a file for persistent storage.
- **Console Output**: Easily view logs in the console during development.
- **Filter Logs**: Filter logs based on severity levels to focus on critical issues.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `my_logger`

## Installation
To add the `my_logger` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  my_logger: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if you plan to log to a file. Add the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your app's Info.plist to allow file access. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save logs.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use `my_logger`, you need to create an instance of the logger and start logging messages. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:my_logger/my_logger.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an instance of the logger
    final logger = RealFlutter();

    // Log an info message
    logger.logInfo("MyApp started");

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('My Logger Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log a button press event
              logger.logInfo("Button pressed");
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that logs messages when the app starts and when a button is pressed.

# Complete Example of `my_logger`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:my_logger/my_logger.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an instance of the logger
    final logger = RealFlutter();

    // Log an info message when the app starts
    logger.logInfo("MyApp started");

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('My Logger Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log a button press event
              logger.logInfo("Button pressed");
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. Inside MyApp, an instance of RealFlutter (the logger) is created.
// 3. The logger logs an info message indicating that the app has started.
// 4. The app displays a simple UI with an AppBar and a button.
// 5. When the button is pressed, another info message is logged indicating the button press event.
// 6. This allows developers to track the app's behavior and user interactions through the logs.
