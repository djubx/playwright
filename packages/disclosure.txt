Here's a detailed technical blog on the "disclosure" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Disclosure Flutter Package

The **Disclosure** package for Flutter is a powerful tool designed to manage user consent and privacy disclosures in mobile applications. It provides a straightforward way to present users with necessary information regarding data collection, usage, and privacy policies, ensuring compliance with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the Disclosure package in scenarios such as:
- **User Registration**: When users sign up for your app, you can present them with a consent form.
- **Data Collection**: If your app collects personal data, you need to inform users about what data is collected and how it will be used.
- **Privacy Policy Updates**: Whenever there are changes to your privacy policy, you can use this package to notify users and obtain their consent.

## Features

- **Customizable UI**: The package allows you to customize the appearance of the disclosure dialog to match your app's theme.
- **Multi-Language Support**: You can provide disclosures in multiple languages, making it accessible to a broader audience.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is easy to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.
- **User Consent Tracking**: It helps in tracking user consent, which is essential for compliance with privacy regulations.

By using the Disclosure package, you can enhance user trust and ensure that your application adheres to legal requirements regarding user data.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Disclosure Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the Disclosure package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  disclosure: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request user consent for data usage:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for profile pictures.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the Disclosure dialog.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:disclosure/disclosure.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Disclosure Example',
      home: DisclosureExample(),
    );
  }
}

class DisclosureExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Disclosure Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the disclosure dialog
            showDisclosureDialog(context);
          },
          child: Text('Show Disclosure'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showDisclosureDialog(BuildContext context) {
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
        return DisclosureDialog(
          title: 'Privacy Policy',
          content: 'We collect your data to improve your experience.',
          onAccept: () {
            // Handle user acceptance
            Navigator.of(context).pop();
          },
          onDecline: () {
            // Handle user decline
            Navigator.of(context).pop();
          },
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that shows a disclosure dialog when the user taps a button. The dialog presents the user with a privacy policy and options to accept or decline.

# Complete Example of the Disclosure Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:disclosure/disclosure.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Disclosure Example',
      home: DisclosureExample(),
    );
  }
}

// Widget that contains the disclosure button
class DisclosureExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Disclosure Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the disclosure dialog when the button is pressed
            showDisclosureDialog(context);
          },
          child: Text('Show Disclosure'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to display the disclosure dialog
  void showDisclosureDialog(BuildContext context) {
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
        return DisclosureDialog(
          title: 'Privacy Policy',
          content: 'We collect your data to improve your experience.',
          onAccept: () {
            // Handle user acceptance of the policy
            Navigator.of(context).pop();
          },
          onDecline: () {
            // Handle user decline of the policy
            Navigator.of(context).pop();
          },
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The DisclosureExample widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. When the user taps the "Show Disclosure" button, the showDisclosureDialog function is called.
// 4. This function displays a DisclosureDialog with a title and content.
// 5. The user can either accept or decline the privacy policy.
// 6. If accepted, the dialog closes, and you can handle further actions (e.g., saving consent).
// 7. If declined, the dialog also closes, and you can handle the decline accordingly.
```
