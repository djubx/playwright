# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Material Text Fields

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `material_text_fields` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `material_text_fields` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  material_text_fields: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include any necessary permissions, especially if you are using features that require user data input.

## Step 3: Using Material Text Fields

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in a Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to create a form with customizable text fields.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:material_text_fields/material_text_fields.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Material Text Fields Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Material Text Fields Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: MyForm(), // Call the MyForm widget
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyFormState createState() => _MyFormState();
}

class _MyFormState extends State<MyForm> {
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>(); // Key to identify the form
  String _username = ''; // Variable to hold username input
  String _password = ''; // Variable to hold password input

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Form(
      key: _formKey, // Assign the form key
      child: Column(
        children: <Widget>[
          // Username text field
          MaterialTextField(
            labelText: 'Username',
            onChanged: (value) {
              _username = value; // Update username variable
            },
            validator: (value) {
              if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
                return 'Please enter your username'; // Validation message
              }
              return null; // No error
            },
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 16.0), // Space between fields
          // Password text field
          MaterialTextField(
            labelText: 'Password',
            obscureText: true, // Hide password input
            onChanged: (value) {
              _password = value; // Update password variable
            },
            validator: (value) {
              if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
                return 'Please enter your password'; // Validation message
              }
              return null; // No error
            },
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 16.0), // Space between fields
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) {
                // Validate the form
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Processing Data')),
                );
                // Here you can handle the form submission
              }
            },
            child: Text('Submit'), // Submit button
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code defines a simple Flutter application using the material_text_fields package.
// The main function runs the RealFlutter app, which is a StatelessWidget.
// The app contains a MaterialApp with a title and a theme, and a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// The body contains a MyForm widget, which is a StatefulWidget that manages the form state.

// In the MyForm widget, we define a GlobalKey to identify the form and two String variables to hold the username and password inputs.
// The build method returns a Form widget that contains two MaterialTextField widgets for username and password input.
// Each text field has a label, an onChanged callback to update the respective variable, and a validator to check for empty input.
// A SizedBox is used to add space between the text fields and the submit button.
// When the submit button is pressed, the form is validated, and if successful, a SnackBar is shown indicating that data is being processed.
// This structure allows for easy customization and validation of user input in a Flutter application.
```
