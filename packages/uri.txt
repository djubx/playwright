Here's a detailed technical blog on the "uri" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Overview of the "uri" Flutter Package

The `uri` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify the handling of URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) in Flutter applications. It provides a robust set of features for parsing, manipulating, and constructing URIs, making it an essential package for developers who need to work with web resources, APIs, or any form of data that requires URI management.

## When to Use the `uri` Package

You should consider using the `uri` package in scenarios such as:

- **API Integration**: When your application interacts with RESTful APIs, constructing and parsing URIs is crucial for making requests and handling responses.
- **Deep Linking**: If your app supports deep linking, the `uri` package can help manage the incoming URIs and extract necessary parameters.
- **Data Management**: When dealing with data that requires specific formatting or encoding in URIs, this package can streamline the process.

## Key Features

- **Parsing**: Easily parse URIs into their components (scheme, host, path, query parameters, etc.).
- **Building**: Construct URIs from individual components, ensuring proper encoding and formatting.
- **Validation**: Check if a given string is a valid URI.
- **Manipulation**: Modify existing URIs by adding or removing components.

The `uri` package is a must-have for any Flutter developer looking to enhance their application's URI handling capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `uri` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `uri` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  uri: ^0.1.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the `uri` package to start using its features:

```dart
import 'package:uri/uri.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `uri` package to parse and construct URIs:

```dart
void main() {
  // Parsing a URI
  var uri = Uri.parse('https://example.com/path?query=parameter');

  // Accessing URI components
  print('Scheme: ${uri.scheme}'); // Output: https
  print('Host: ${uri.host}'); // Output: example.com
  print('Path: ${uri.path}'); // Output: /path
  print('Query: ${uri.query}'); // Output: query=parameter

  // Constructing a new URI
  var newUri = Uri(
    scheme: 'https',
    host: 'example.com',
    path: '/newpath',
    queryParameters: {'key': 'value'},
  );

  print('New URI: $newUri'); // Output: https://example.com/newpath?key=value
}
```

This example demonstrates how to parse a URI, access its components, and construct a new URI using the `uri` package.

# Complete Example: Using the `uri` Package in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:uri/uri.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'URI Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('URI Package Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: UriExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class UriExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Parsing a sample URI
    var uri = Uri.parse('https://example.com/path?query=parameter');

    // Constructing a new URI
    var newUri = Uri(
      scheme: 'https',
      host: 'example.com',
      path: '/newpath',
      queryParameters: {'key': 'value'},
    );

    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Parsed URI: $uri'), // Displaying the parsed URI
        Text('New URI: $newUri'), // Displaying the constructed URI
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the UriExample widget.
// 4. The UriExample widget parses a sample URI and constructs a new URI.
// 5. The parsed and constructed URIs are displayed in a Column widget at the center of the screen.
```
