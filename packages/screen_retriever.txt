# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Screen Retriever

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **screen_retriever** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **screen_retriever** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  screen_retriever: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version should be 21 or higher
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save screenshots.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for capturing screenshots.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to capture a screenshot when a button is pressed.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:screen_retriever/screen_retriever.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Screen Retriever Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Capture the screenshot
              final image = await ScreenRetriever.capture();
              // Handle the captured image (e.g., save or display)
            },
            child: Text('Capture Screenshot'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the app captures the current screen and stores the image for further use.

# Complete Example of Screen Retriever

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:screen_retriever/screen_retriever.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Screen Retriever Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Capture the screenshot
              final image = await ScreenRetriever.capture();
              // Check if the image is captured successfully
              if (image != null) {
                // Display the captured image in a new screen
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(
                    builder: (context) => DisplayImageScreen(image: image),
                  ),
                );
              } else {
                // Handle the error case
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Failed to capture screenshot')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Capture Screenshot'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DisplayImageScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final Uint8List image;

  DisplayImageScreen({required this.image});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Captured Screenshot')),
      body: Center(
        child: Image.memory(image), // Display the captured image
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the app calls ScreenRetriever.capture() to capture the current screen.
// 5. If the screenshot is captured successfully, it navigates to the DisplayImageScreen, passing the captured image.
// 6. The DisplayImageScreen displays the captured image using Image.memory.
// 7. If the screenshot capture fails, a SnackBar is shown to inform the user of the failure.
```

In summary, the **screen_retriever** package provides a straightforward way to capture screenshots in Flutter applications. The tutorial covered the setup process, platform-specific configurations, and a complete example demonstrating how to use the package effectively. By following the steps outlined, developers can easily integrate screenshot functionality into their Flutter apps, enhancing user experience and providing valuable feedback mechanisms.
