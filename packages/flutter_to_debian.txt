## Part 3: Complete Example

```markdown
<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of flutter_to_debian

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `flutter_to_debian` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_to_debian/flutter_to_debian.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter to Debian Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  String _message = 'Hello, Debian!';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Debian Integration'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              _message,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _updateMessage,
              child: Text('Update Message'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // This function updates the message displayed on the screen
  void _updateMessage() {
    setState(() {
      _message = 'Message Updated!';
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to MyHomePage, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. MyHomePage displays a message and a button.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the _updateMessage function is called, updating the displayed message.
// 6. The setState method triggers a rebuild of the widget, reflecting the new message on the screen.

```
