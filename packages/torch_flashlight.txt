# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `torch_flashlight` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `torch_flashlight` dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     torch_flashlight: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/torch_flashlight).

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to use the camera and flashlight. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

     ```xml
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FLASHLIGHT"/>
     ```

   - **iOS**: For iOS, you need to add a usage description in your `Info.plist` file to inform users why your app needs access to the flashlight. Add the following line:

     ```xml
     <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
     <string>This app requires access to the camera for flashlight functionality.</string>
     ```

## Using the Package

Once you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to toggle the flashlight on and off.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:torch_flashlight/torch_flashlight.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to track the flashlight state
  bool _isFlashlightOn = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Torch Flashlight Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display the current state of the flashlight
              Text(
                _isFlashlightOn ? 'Flashlight is ON' : 'Flashlight is OFF',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _toggleFlashlight, // Call the toggle function
                child: Text(_isFlashlightOn ? 'Turn OFF' : 'Turn ON'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to toggle the flashlight state
  void _toggleFlashlight() async {
    // Check if the flashlight is currently on
    if (_isFlashlightOn) {
      // Turn off the flashlight
      await TorchFlashlight.turnOff();
    } else {
      // Turn on the flashlight
      await TorchFlashlight.turnOn();
    }
    // Update the state to reflect the new flashlight status
    setState(() {
      _isFlashlightOn = !_isFlashlightOn;
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the flashlight.
// 3. In the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a simple UI that displays the current state of the flashlight.
// 4. An ElevatedButton is provided to toggle the flashlight on and off.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the _toggleFlashlight function is called.
// 6. This function checks the current state of the flashlight and calls the appropriate method from the torch_flashlight package to turn it on or off.
// 7. Finally, the state is updated to reflect the new flashlight status, and the UI is rebuilt accordingly.
```
