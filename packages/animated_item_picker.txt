# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Item Picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **animated_item_picker** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **animated_item_picker** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_item_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the **animated_item_picker** in your app.

              onItemSelected: (item) {
                // Update the selected item when an item is picked
                setState(() {
                  selectedItem = item;
                });
              },
              itemBuilder: (context, item, isSelected) {
                // Build the UI for each item
                return Container(
                  padding: EdgeInsets.all(10),
                  margin: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 5),
                  decoration: BoxDecoration(
                    color: isSelected ? Colors.blue : Colors.grey[300],
                    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
                  ),
                  child: Text(
                    item,
                    style: TextStyle(
                      color: isSelected ? Colors.white : Colors.black,
                      fontSize: 18,
                    ),
                  ),

              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
```
// The main function initializes the app and sets up the MaterialApp.
// The RealFlutter class is the root widget of the application.
// The ItemPickerScreen is a stateful widget that manages the selection of items.
// A list of items is defined, and a variable to hold the selected item is created.
// The build method constructs the UI, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// The AnimatedItemPicker widget is used to display the list of items.
// The onItemSelected callback updates the selected item when a user picks an item.
// The itemBuilder function customizes the appearance of each item based on its selection state.
// The selected item is displayed above the picker, providing feedback to the user.
