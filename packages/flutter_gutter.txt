## When to Use flutter_gutter

You should consider using `flutter_gutter` in scenarios where:
- You need to maintain consistent spacing between UI elements across different screen sizes and orientations.
- You want to simplify the management of padding and margins in your Flutter app.
- You are building complex layouts that require precise control over spacing.

## Key Features
- **Flexible Gutter Management**: Easily define and adjust gutters for various screen sizes.
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adapts to different device orientations and sizes.
- **Customizable**: Offers options to customize gutter sizes based on your design requirements.

# flutter_gutter Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `flutter_gutter`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_gutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using flutter_gutter in Your Application

To use `flutter_gutter`, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_gutter/flutter_gutter.dart';
```

You can then utilize the `Gutter` widget to manage spacing in your layout. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
Gutter(
  horizontal: 16.0, // Horizontal gutter size
  vertical: 8.0,    // Vertical gutter size
  child: Column(
    children: [
      Text('Item 1'),
      Text('Item 2'),
      Text('Item 3'),
    ],
  ),
);
```

This will create a column of text items with specified gutters between them.

# Complete Example of flutter_gutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gutter/flutter_gutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Gutter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Gutter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Gutter(
            horizontal: 20.0, // Set horizontal gutter size
            vertical: 10.0,   // Set vertical gutter size
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Container(
                  color: Colors.red,
                  height: 50,
                  width: 100,
                  child: Center(child: Text('Item 1')),
                ),
                Container(
                  color: Colors.green,
                  height: 50,
                  width: 100,
                  child: Center(child: Text('Item 2')),
                ),
                Container(
                  color: Colors.blue,
                  height: 50,
                  width: 100,
                  child: Center(child: Text('Item 3')),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code defines a simple Flutter application using the flutter_gutter package.
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Flutter Gutter Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The Gutter widget is used to manage spacing between the child widgets.
// 6. Inside the Gutter, a Column widget is used to stack three Container widgets vertically.
// 7. Each Container has a different background color and displays a text label.
// 8. The horizontal and vertical properties of the Gutter widget define the spacing between the items.
// This structure allows for a clean and responsive layout, demonstrating the capabilities of the flutter_gutter package.
```

In summary, the `flutter_gutter` package simplifies the management of spacing in Flutter applications, making it easier to create responsive and visually appealing layouts. By following the setup and usage tutorial, developers can quickly integrate this package into their projects and leverage its features to enhance their UI design.
