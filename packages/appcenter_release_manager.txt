# Setting Up and Using appcenter_release_manager

## Installation
To get started with the `appcenter_release_manager` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  appcenter_release_manager: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/appcenter_release_manager).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Add Permissions**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` includes the necessary permissions for network access.
2. **Gradle Configuration**: Update your `build.gradle` file to include the App Center SDK.

### iOS
1. **CocoaPods**: Make sure to run `pod install` in the `ios` directory of your Flutter project to install the necessary dependencies.
2. **Info.plist**: Update your `Info.plist` to include any required configurations for App Center.

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize the App Center and manage releases:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appcenter_release_manager/appcenter_release_manager.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'App Center Release Manager Demo',
      home: ReleaseManagerHome(),
    );
  }
}

class ReleaseManagerHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ReleaseManagerHomeState createState() => _ReleaseManagerHomeState();
}

class _ReleaseManagerHomeState extends State<ReleaseManagerHome> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize App Center Release Manager
    AppCenterReleaseManager.initialize('YOUR_APP_SECRET');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Release Manager Home'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Trigger a release
            AppCenterReleaseManager.releaseApp('YOUR_APP_ID');
          },
          child: Text('Release App'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the App Center Release Manager with an app secret and provide a button to trigger a release.

# Complete Example of appcenter_release_manager

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:appcenter_release_manager/appcenter_release_manager.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'App Center Release Manager Demo',
      home: ReleaseManagerHome(),
    );
  }
}

class ReleaseManagerHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ReleaseManagerHomeState createState() => _ReleaseManagerHomeState();
}

class _ReleaseManagerHomeState extends State<ReleaseManagerHome> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize App Center Release Manager with your app secret
    AppCenterReleaseManager.initialize('YOUR_APP_SECRET');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Release Manager Home'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Trigger a release of the app using the App Center Release Manager
            AppCenterReleaseManager.releaseApp('YOUR_APP_ID');
          },
          child: Text('Release App'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. ReleaseManagerHome is a stateful widget that initializes the App Center Release Manager in its initState method.
// 4. The build method of ReleaseManagerHome creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it calls the releaseApp method from AppCenterReleaseManager, triggering the release process for the app.
// 7. The app secret and app ID must be replaced with your actual App Center credentials for the release to work.
