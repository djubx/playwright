# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_feather_icons

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_feather_icons` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_feather_icons: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the icons, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_feather_icons/flutter_feather_icons.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Icons

You can now use the Feather icons in your Flutter widgets. Here’s a simple example of how to use an icon:

```dart
Icon(FeatherIcons.home, size: 30.0, color: Colors.blue);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons by changing their size and color. Here’s an example of how to create a row of icons with different colors:

```dart
Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
  children: [
    Icon(FeatherIcons.home, size: 40.0, color: Colors.red),
    Icon(FeatherIcons.settings, size: 40.0, color: Colors.green),
    Icon(FeatherIcons.user, size: 40.0, color: Colors.blue),
  ],
);
```

With these steps, you can easily set up and use the `flutter_feather_icons` package in your Flutter applications.

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Feather Icons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Feather Icons Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Displaying a home icon
              Icon(FeatherIcons.home, size: 50.0, color: Colors.blue),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a settings icon
              Icon(FeatherIcons.settings, size: 50.0, color: Colors.green),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a user icon
              Icon(FeatherIcons.user, size: 50.0, color: Colors.red),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts by running the main function, which initializes the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Feather Icons Demo'.
// In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// A Column widget is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// Each icon is created using the Icon widget, specifying the Feather icon, size, and color.
// SizedBox widgets are used to add space between the icons for better visual separation.
// The app demonstrates the use of three different Feather icons: home, settings, and user.
