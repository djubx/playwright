# msgpack_dart Flutter Package

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
## Description

The `msgpack_dart` package is a Dart implementation of the MessagePack serialization format, which is a binary format that is efficient for both size and speed. It is particularly useful for applications that require fast data serialization and deserialization, such as mobile applications, web services, and real-time data processing.

### When to Use

- **Performance-Critical Applications**: When you need to serialize and deserialize data quickly, especially in scenarios where bandwidth is limited.
- **Cross-Platform Communication**: When your Flutter app needs to communicate with services that use MessagePack, such as certain APIs or microservices.
- **Data Storage**: When you want to store data in a compact binary format, which can save space compared to JSON or XML.

### Features

- **Compact Binary Format**: Reduces the size of the data being transmitted or stored.
- **Fast Serialization/Deserialization**: Optimized for speed, making it suitable for performance-sensitive applications.
- **Support for Dart Types**: Easily converts Dart objects to MessagePack format and vice versa.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across different platforms, including Android and iOS.

## Tutorial

### Installation

To use the `msgpack_dart` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  msgpack_dart: ^2.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

### Basic Usage

To use the `msgpack_dart` package, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:msgpack_dart/msgpack_dart.dart';
```

2. Create a Dart object that you want to serialize:

```dart
Map<String, dynamic> data = {
  'name': 'RealFlutter',
  'version': 1.0,
  'features': ['fast', 'compact', 'efficient']
};
```

3. Serialize the object to MessagePack format:

```dart
final packedData = MsgPack.encode(data);
```

4. Deserialize the MessagePack data back to a Dart object:

```dart
final unpackedData = MsgPack.decode(packedData);
```

### Example Code

You can now use the above steps in your Flutter application to serialize and deserialize data using the `msgpack_dart` package.

## Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:msgpack_dart/msgpack_dart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'MessagePack Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('MessagePack Serialization'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: MessagePackDemo(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MessagePackDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MessagePackDemoState createState() => _MessagePackDemoState();
}

class _MessagePackDemoState extends State<MessagePackDemo> {
  String _result = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _serializeAndDeserialize();
  }

  void _serializeAndDeserialize() {
    // Step 1: Create a Dart object to serialize
    Map<String, dynamic> data = {
      'name': 'RealFlutter',
      'version': 1.0,
      'features': ['fast', 'compact', 'efficient']
    };

    // Step 2: Serialize the Dart object to MessagePack format
    final packedData = MsgPack.encode(data);

    // Step 3: Deserialize the MessagePack data back to a Dart object
    final unpackedData = MsgPack.decode(packedData);

    // Step 4: Update the UI with the unpacked data
    setState(() {
      _result = unpackedData.toString();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Serialized and Deserialized Data:'),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        Text(_result),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// Inside the Scaffold, we have an AppBar and a Center widget that contains the MessagePackDemo widget.
// The MessagePackDemo widget is a StatefulWidget that initializes its state in initState.
// In the _serializeAndDeserialize method, we create a Dart object (a Map) to serialize.
// We then use MsgPack.encode to serialize the object into MessagePack format.
// After that, we deserialize the packed data back into a Dart object using MsgPack.decode.
// Finally, we update the UI with the unpacked data by calling setState, which triggers a rebuild of the widget.
// The unpacked data is displayed in the center of the screen as text.
