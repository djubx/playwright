# Overview of the fsm2 Flutter Package

The `fsm2` package is a powerful state management solution for Flutter applications that implements the finite state machine (FSM) pattern. This package is particularly useful for managing complex states in applications, allowing developers to define clear transitions between states and handle events in a structured manner.

## When to Use `fsm2`
- **Complex State Management**: When your application has multiple states and transitions, such as a multi-step form or a game with different levels.
- **Event-Driven Applications**: Ideal for applications that respond to user inputs or external events, where the state needs to change based on these interactions.
- **Clarity and Maintainability**: When you want to improve the clarity of your state management logic, making it easier to maintain and understand.

## Key Features
- **Finite State Machine Implementation**: Provides a clear structure for defining states and transitions.
- **Event Handling**: Allows you to handle events that trigger state changes.
- **Type Safety**: Utilizes Dart's strong typing to ensure that state transitions are valid.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be easily integrated into existing Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the fsm2 Package

## Installation
To use the `fsm2` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fsm2: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `fsm2` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no specific configurations required for either platform, making it easy to integrate into your Flutter application.

## Basic Usage
To use the `fsm2` package, you will need to define your states, events, and transitions. Here’s a simple example to illustrate how to set up a finite state machine using the `fsm2` package.

1. **Define States**: Create an enumeration for your states.
2. **Define Events**: Create an enumeration for your events.
3. **Create the State Machine**: Use the `StateMachine` class to define your states and transitions.

Here’s a basic setup:

```dart
import 'package:fsm2/fsm2.dart';

// Define your states
enum AppState { initial, loading, loaded, error }

// Define your events
enum AppEvent { load, success, failure }

// Create the state machine
final stateMachine = StateMachine<AppState, AppEvent>(
  initialState: AppState.initial,
  states: {
    AppState.initial: {
      AppEvent.load: AppState.loading,
    },
    AppState.loading: {
      AppEvent.success: AppState.loaded,
      AppEvent.failure: AppState.error,
    },
    AppState.loaded: {},
    AppState.error: {
      AppEvent.load: AppState.loading,
    },
  },
);
```

This setup allows you to manage the application state based on events, providing a clear and maintainable structure.

# Complete Example of Using fsm2 in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fsm2/fsm2.dart';

// Define your states
enum AppState { initial, loading, loaded, error }

// Define your events
enum AppEvent { load, success, failure }

// Create the state machine
final stateMachine = StateMachine<AppState, AppEvent>(
  initialState: AppState.initial,
  states: {
    AppState.initial: {
      AppEvent.load: AppState.loading,
    },
    AppState.loading: {
      AppEvent.success: AppState.loaded,
      AppEvent.failure: AppState.error,
    },
    AppState.loaded: {},
    AppState.error: {
      AppEvent.load: AppState.loading,
    },
  },
);

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'FSM2 Example',
      home: StateMachineWidget(),
    );
  }
}

class StateMachineWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StateMachineWidgetState createState() => _StateMachineWidgetState();
}

class _StateMachineWidgetState extends State<StateMachineWidget> {
  // Initialize the current state
  AppState currentState = stateMachine.initialState;

  // Function to handle events
  void handleEvent(AppEvent event) {
    // Transition to the next state based on the event
    setState(() {
      currentState = stateMachine.transition(currentState, event);
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('FSM2 Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the current state
            Text('Current State: $currentState'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to load data
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => handleEvent(AppEvent.load),
              child: Text('Load Data'),
            ),
            // Button to simulate success
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => handleEvent(AppEvent.success),
              child: Text('Simulate Success'),
            ),
            // Button to simulate failure
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => handleEvent(AppEvent.failure),
              child: Text('Simulate Failure'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the initial state.
// 2. When the "Load Data" button is pressed, it triggers the load event, transitioning to the loading state.
// 3. Depending on the outcome, pressing "Simulate Success" will transition to the loaded state, while "Simulate Failure" will transition to the error state.
// 4. The current state is displayed on the screen, allowing users to see the state changes in real-time.
