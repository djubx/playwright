# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_fadein`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_fadein` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_fadein: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `flutter_fadein` package, you can wrap any widget with the `FadeIn` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_fadein/flutter_fadein.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('FadeIn Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FadeIn(
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Set the duration for the fade-in effect
            child: Text(
              'Hello, Flutter!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the text "Hello, Flutter!" will fade in over a duration of 2 seconds when the widget is built.

# Complete Example of `flutter_fadein`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_fadein/flutter_fadein.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter FadeIn Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('FadeIn Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // FadeIn widget for the first text
              FadeIn(
                duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Fade-in duration
                child: Text(
                  'Welcome to RealFlutter!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between texts
              // FadeIn widget for the second text
              FadeIn(
                duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Fade-in duration
                child: Text(
                  'Enjoy your stay!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with RealFlutter as the root widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to stack two FadeIn widgets vertically.
// 5. Each FadeIn widget wraps a Text widget, which will fade in over the specified duration.
// 6. The first text fades in over 1 second, while the second text fades in over 2 seconds.
// 7. The result is a smooth transition effect that enhances the user experience.
