# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `searchbar_animation` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     searchbar_animation: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and ensure you have the necessary permissions for network access if your search functionality requires it.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:searchbar_animation/searchbar_animation.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

To use the `searchbar_animation` package, you can create a simple search bar in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:searchbar_animation/searchbar_animation.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Search Bar Animation Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SearchBarAnimation(
            isOriginalAnimation: true,
            onTap: () {
              // Action when the search bar is tapped
            },
            textEditingController: TextEditingController(),
            hintText: 'Search...',
            // Additional properties can be set here
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with an animated search bar. You can customize the search bar's appearance and behavior by modifying its properties.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:searchbar_animation/searchbar_animation.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Search Bar Animation Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SearchBarAnimation(
            isOriginalAnimation: true, // Use the original animation style
            onTap: () {
              // Action when the search bar is tapped
              print("Search bar tapped!");
            },
            textEditingController: TextEditingController(), // Controller for the search input
            hintText: 'Search...', // Placeholder text for the search bar
            // Additional properties can be set here
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a SearchBarAnimation widget is created.
// 4. The SearchBarAnimation widget is configured with properties like isOriginalAnimation, onTap, and textEditingController.
// 5. When the search bar is tapped, the onTap callback is triggered, printing a message to the console.
// 6. The hintText property provides a placeholder for the search input, guiding users on what to enter.
```
