# Tutorial: Setting Up CometChat Chat UI Kit

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `cometchat_chat_uikit` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `cometchat_chat_uikit` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cometchat_chat_uikit: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/cometchat_chat_uikit).

## Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Initialize CometChat

Before using the chat UI kit, you need to initialize CometChat in your application. This is typically done in the `main.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cometchat_chat_uikit/cometchat_chat_uikit.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  CometChat.init("YOUR_APP_ID", new CometChatSettings(appId: "YOUR_APP_ID", region: "YOUR_REGION"));
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

Replace `YOUR_APP_ID` and `YOUR_REGION` with your CometChat application ID and region.

## Step 5: Using the Chat UI Kit

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using the chat UI components in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a chat screen:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cometchat_chat_uikit/cometchat_chat_uikit.dart';

class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Chat")),
      body: CometChatMessageList(
        // Pass the required parameters
        onMessageTap: (message) {
          // Handle message tap
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic chat screen using the CometChat message list component.

With these steps, you should have a basic setup of the `cometchat_chat_uikit` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of CometChat Chat UI Kit

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cometchat_chat_uikit/cometchat_chat_uikit.dart';

void main() {
  // Ensure Flutter bindings are initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize CometChat with your app ID and region
  CometChat.init("YOUR_APP_ID", new CometChatSettings(appId: "YOUR_APP_ID", region: "YOUR_REGION"));
  
  // Run the Flutter application
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'CometChat Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: ChatScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Chat")),
      body: CometChatMessageList(
        // The message list component that displays chat messages
        onMessageTap: (message) {
          // Handle message tap event
          print("Message tapped: ${message.text}");
        },
        onUserTap: (user) {
          // Handle user tap event
          print("User tapped: ${user.name}");
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and CometChat with the provided app ID and region.
// 2. MyApp is the root widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to ChatScreen, which is the main chat interface.
// 4. In ChatScreen, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a CometChatMessageList widget.
// 5. The CometChatMessageList widget displays the chat messages and handles user interactions.
// 6. When a message or user is tapped, the corresponding event is printed to the console.
```
