# Truecaller SDK Flutter Package

The `truecaller_sdk` Flutter package provides developers with a seamless way to integrate Truecaller functionalities into their Flutter applications. Truecaller is a popular caller identification and spam blocking service that helps users identify unknown callers and manage their contacts more effectively. This package allows developers to leverage Truecaller’s features, such as user identification, contact management, and spam detection, directly within their Flutter apps.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `truecaller_sdk` package in scenarios such as:
- **Caller Identification**: When you want to provide users with the ability to identify unknown callers.
- **Spam Detection**: To help users avoid spam calls by identifying them in real-time.
- **Contact Management**: When you need to enhance the contact management experience in your app by integrating Truecaller’s database.

## Features

- **User Identification**: Retrieve user details based on their phone number.
- **Spam Detection**: Identify and block spam calls.
- **Contact Management**: Access and manage contacts using Truecaller’s API.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS platforms.

The `truecaller_sdk` package is a powerful tool for developers looking to enhance their applications with caller identification and spam detection features, providing a better user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Truecaller SDK in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `truecaller_sdk` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `truecaller_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  truecaller_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the current version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CONTACTS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>

<application>
    ...
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.truecaller.sdk.APP_KEY"
        android:value="YOUR_TRUECALLER_APP_KEY"/>
</application>
```

Replace `YOUR_TRUECALLER_APP_KEY` with your actual Truecaller app key.

2. **Enable ProGuard**: If you are using ProGuard, ensure that you add the necessary rules to keep the Truecaller SDK classes.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to contacts for Truecaller integration.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the photo library for Truecaller integration.</string>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure that your `Podfile` is updated to include the Truecaller SDK.

## Step 3: Initialize the SDK

In your Flutter application, you need to initialize the Truecaller SDK. This is typically done in the `main.dart` file.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:truecaller_sdk/truecaller_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Truecaller SDK Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Using the SDK

You can now use the Truecaller SDK to perform various operations. For example, to initiate a user identification request:

```dart
void identifyUser() async {
  final result = await TruecallerSdk.getUserDetails();
  if (result != null) {
    // Handle user details
  } else {
    // Handle error
  }
}
```

This function retrieves user details based on the phone number.

With these steps, you have successfully set up the `truecaller_sdk` package in your Flutter application. You can now start integrating Truecaller features into your app.

# Complete Example: Truecaller SDK in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:truecaller_sdk/truecaller_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Truecaller SDK Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String userDetails = "User details will appear here";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Truecaller SDK
    TruecallerSdk.initialize();
  }

  // Function to identify user
  void identifyUser() async {
    // Request user details from Truecaller
    final result = await TruecallerSdk.getUserDetails();
    if (result != null) {
      // Update the state with user details
      setState(() {
        userDetails = "Name: ${result.name}, Phone: ${result.phoneNumber}";
      });
    } else {
      // Handle error
      setState(() {
        userDetails = "Failed to retrieve user details.";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Truecaller SDK Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(userDetails), // Display user details
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: identifyUser, // Call identifyUser on button press
              child: Text('Identify User'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. In the HomeScreen's initState, the Truecaller SDK is initialized.
// 4. When the user presses the "Identify User" button, the identifyUser function is called.
// 5. This function requests user details from the Truecaller SDK.
// 6. If successful, the user details are displayed on the screen; otherwise, an error message is shown.
```

In this blog, we covered the `truecaller_sdk` Flutter package, including its description, setup tutorial, and a complete example. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the SDK, requests user details, and displays them in the UI. This integration enhances the user experience by providing caller identification and spam detection features directly within your Flutter application.
