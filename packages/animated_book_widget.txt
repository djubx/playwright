# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Animated Book Widget

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `animated_book_widget` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `animated_book_widget` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_book_widget: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:animated_book_widget/animated_book_widget.dart';
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

#### Android

Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

### Step 4: Using the Widget

To use the `animated_book_widget`, you need to create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and configure it with your desired settings.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_book_widget/animated_book_widget.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Book Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: BookScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class BookScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animated Book Widget'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: RealFlutter(
          // Initialize the book widget with a list of pages
          pages: List.generate(
            5,
            (index) => Container(
              color: index % 2 == 0 ? Colors.white : Colors.grey[200],
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Page ${index + 1}',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
          // Customize the page turning effect
          pageTurnDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
          // Set the initial page
          initialPage: 0,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The `main` function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// `MyApp` is the root widget of the application, setting up the MaterialApp.
// `BookScreen` is the main screen displaying the animated book widget.
// `RealFlutter` is the main class from the `animated_book_widget` package.
// The `pages` parameter is a list of widgets representing each page of the book.
// `pageTurnDuration` controls the speed of the page-turning animation.
// `initialPage` sets the starting page when the book is first opened.

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app starts with the `main` function, which calls `runApp` with `MyApp`.
// 2. `MyApp` sets up a `MaterialApp` with a `BookScreen` as the home screen.
// 3. `BookScreen` contains a `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget.
// 4. Inside the `Center` widget, the `RealFlutter` widget is used to display the book.
// 5. The `RealFlutter` widget is configured with a list of pages, each a `Container` with text.
// 6. The user can interact with the book, turning pages with a realistic animation.
