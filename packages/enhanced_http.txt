# Enhanced HTTP: A Comprehensive Overview

The `enhanced_http` package is a powerful and flexible HTTP client for Flutter applications, designed to simplify the process of making network requests while providing additional features that enhance the developer experience. This package is particularly useful when you need to handle complex HTTP interactions, such as custom headers, interceptors, and error handling.

## When to Use `enhanced_http`
- When you need a more feature-rich HTTP client than the default `http` package.
- If your application requires advanced error handling and response parsing.
- When you want to implement request/response interceptors for logging or modifying requests.

## Key Features
- **Interceptors**: Easily add interceptors to modify requests and responses globally.
- **Customizable**: Supports custom headers and timeout settings.
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling capabilities to manage different HTTP status codes.
- **Response Parsing**: Simplified response parsing with built-in utilities.

# Setting Up and Using Enhanced HTTP

## Installation
To add the `enhanced_http` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  enhanced_http: ^latest_version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for internet access:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure App Transport Security settings in your `Info.plist` if you are accessing non-HTTPS URLs:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `enhanced_http` package, you can create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class, which will handle your HTTP requests. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to make a GET request:

```dart
import 'package:enhanced_http/enhanced_http.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final EnhancedHttpClient client;

  RealFlutter() : client = EnhancedHttpClient();

  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    try {
      final response = await client.get('https://api.example.com/data');
      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        // Handle successful response
        print(response.body);
      } else {
        // Handle error response
        print('Error: ${response.statusCode}');
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle exceptions
      print('Exception: $e');
    }
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a simple HTTP client and make a GET request. You can expand this by adding interceptors and custom headers as needed.

# Complete Example of Enhanced HTTP in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:enhanced_http/enhanced_http.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final EnhancedHttpClient client;

  // Constructor to initialize the EnhancedHttpClient
  RealFlutter() : client = EnhancedHttpClient();

  // Method to fetch data from an API
  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    try {
      // Making a GET request to the specified URL
      final response = await client.get('https://api.example.com/data');
      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        // If the response is successful, print the body
        print(response.body);
      } else {
        // If the response is an error, print the status code
        print('Error: ${response.statusCode}');
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // Catch any exceptions and print the error
      print('Exception: $e');
    }
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Enhanced HTTP Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Enhanced HTTP Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create an instance of RealFlutter
              RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();
              // Call the fetchData method to make the HTTP request
              realFlutter.fetchData();
            },
            child: Text('Fetch Data'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget has an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, creates an instance of RealFlutter.
// 4. The fetchData() method is called, which makes a GET request to the specified API endpoint.
// 5. Depending on the response status, it either prints the response body or an error message.
// 6. Any exceptions during the request are caught and printed to the console.
