# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Local Rembg

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `local_rembg` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `local_rembg` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  local_rembg: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update Android Manifest**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` to request permission for photo library access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to remove backgrounds from images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos for background removal.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement background removal.

# Complete Example of Using Local Rembg

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:local_rembg/local_rembg.dart';
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:image_picker/image_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Local Rembg Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ImagePickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ImagePickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImagePickerScreenState createState() => _ImagePickerScreenState();
}

class _ImagePickerScreenState extends State<ImagePickerScreen> {
  File? _image;
  final ImagePicker _picker = ImagePicker();
  bool _isProcessing = false;

  // Function to pick an image from the gallery
  Future<void> _pickImage() async {
    final pickedFile = await _picker.getImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
    if (pickedFile != null) {
      setState(() {
        _image = File(pickedFile.path);
      });
      _removeBackground();
    }
  }

  // Function to remove the background from the selected image
  Future<void> _removeBackground() async {
    if (_image == null) return;

    setState(() {
      _isProcessing = true; // Start processing
    });

    // Call the local_rembg package to remove the background
    final result = await LocalRembg.removeBackground(_image!);

    setState(() {
      _image = result; // Update the image with the background removed
      _isProcessing = false; // Stop processing
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Local Rembg Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            _isProcessing
                ? CircularProgressIndicator() // Show loading indicator while processing
                : _image != null
                    ? Image.file(_image!) // Display the processed image
                    : Text('No image selected.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImage, // Trigger image picking
              child: Text('Pick Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home screen is an ImagePickerScreen where users can pick an image from their gallery.
// 3. When the user selects an image, the _pickImage function is called.
// 4. The selected image is displayed, and the _removeBackground function is triggered.
// 5. The local_rembg package processes the image to remove the background.
// 6. Once processing is complete, the image with the background removed is displayed on the screen.
```

In this blog, we explored the `local_rembg` Flutter package, detailing its features, setup process, and providing a complete example of its usage. The application flow is straightforward, allowing users to pick an image, process it to remove the background, and display the resultâ€”all done locally on their devices. This package is a great asset for developers looking to enhance their applications with image processing capabilities.
