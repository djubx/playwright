# Overview of the esc_pos_utils_updated Package

The `esc_pos_utils_updated` package is a Flutter library designed to facilitate the creation of ESC/POS commands for thermal printers. This package is particularly useful for developers building applications that require printing receipts, tickets, or any other type of document using ESC/POS compatible printers. 

## When to Use This Package
You should consider using `esc_pos_utils_updated` when:
- You are developing a point-of-sale (POS) application that needs to print receipts.
- You want to print tickets or labels from your Flutter application.
- You need to format text, images, or barcodes for printing on thermal printers.

## Key Features
- **Text Formatting**: Easily format text with styles such as bold, italic, underline, and alignment.
- **Image Printing**: Support for printing images in various formats.
- **Barcode Generation**: Generate and print barcodes in different formats.
- **Custom Commands**: Send custom ESC/POS commands to the printer for advanced functionalities.

This package simplifies the process of interacting with thermal printers, making it a valuable tool for Flutter developers in the retail and hospitality industries.

# Setup and Usage of esc_pos_utils_updated

## Installation
To add the `esc_pos_utils_updated` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  esc_pos_utils_updated: ^latest_version
```

Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/esc_pos_utils_updated).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the network and Bluetooth if you are using Bluetooth printers:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. For iOS, you may need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are using Bluetooth:
   ```xml
   <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to Bluetooth to connect to printers.</string>
   ```

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you will typically create an instance of the `PosPrint` class and use its methods to format and send data to the printer. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a basic print job:

```dart
import 'package:esc_pos_utils_updated/esc_pos_utils_updated.dart';

void printReceipt() {
  final profile = await CapabilityProfile.load();
  final printer = NetworkPrinter(PaperSize.mm80, profile);
  
  // Connect to the printer
  final result = await printer.connect('192.168.0.100', port: 9100);
  if (result == PosPrintResult.success) {
    printer.text('Hello World', styles: PosStyles.bold());
    printer.cut();
    printer.disconnect();
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to connect to a network printer, print a simple text, and then cut the paper.

# Complete Example of Using esc_pos_utils_updated

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:esc_pos_utils_updated/esc_pos_utils_updated.dart';
import 'package:esc_pos_printer/esc_pos_printer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'ESC/POS Printer Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('ESC/POS Printer Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              printReceipt();
            },
            child: Text('Print Receipt'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Function to print a receipt
void printReceipt() async {
  // Load the capability profile for the printer
  final profile = await CapabilityProfile.load();
  
  // Create a printer instance with the desired paper size
  final printer = NetworkPrinter(PaperSize.mm80, profile);
  
  // Connect to the printer using its IP address and port
  final result = await printer.connect('192.168.0.100', port: 9100);
  
  // Check if the connection was successful
  if (result == PosPrintResult.success) {
    // Print a bold text
    printer.text('Hello World', styles: PosStyles.bold());
    
    // Print a line of text
    printer.text('This is a receipt example.');
    
    // Print an image (assuming you have an image in your assets)
    // final image = await profile.loadImage('assets/logo.png');
    // printer.image(image);
    
    // Print a barcode
    printer.barcode(Barcode.code128('1234567890'), width: 2, height: 60);
    
    // Cut the paper after printing
    printer.cut();
    
    // Disconnect from the printer
    printer.disconnect();
  } else {
    // Handle connection error
    print('Could not connect to the printer.');
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with a simple Flutter app that has a button to print a receipt.
2. When the button is pressed, the `printReceipt` function is called.
3. Inside `printReceipt`, the capability profile for the printer is loaded.
4. A `NetworkPrinter` instance is created with the specified paper size.
5. The app attempts to connect to the printer using its IP address and port.
6. If the connection is successful, it prints a bold "Hello World" message.
7. It then prints a line of text and a barcode.
8. Finally, it cuts the paper and disconnects from the printer.
9. If the connection fails, an error message is printed to the console.
