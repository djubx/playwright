# flutter_masked_text2 Package Overview

The `flutter_masked_text2` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for the creation of input fields with masks. This is particularly useful when dealing with formatted data such as phone numbers, credit card numbers, dates, and other structured inputs. By applying masks, developers can guide users to enter data in a specific format, enhancing user experience and reducing input errors.

## When to Use `flutter_masked_text2`

You should consider using `flutter_masked_text2` in scenarios where:
- You need to collect structured data from users, such as phone numbers, dates, or credit card information.
- You want to improve the user experience by providing visual cues on how to enter data correctly.
- You need to validate user input in real-time as they type.

## Features

- **Customizable Masks**: You can define your own input masks to suit your application's needs.
- **Real-time Input Validation**: The package provides immediate feedback on the validity of the input.
- **Easy Integration**: It can be easily integrated into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.
- **Support for Various Input Types**: Whether it's a phone number, date, or any other structured format, this package can handle it.

In summary, `flutter_masked_text2` is an essential package for any Flutter developer looking to enhance their application's data input capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_masked_text2

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `flutter_masked_text2`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_masked_text2: ^0.2.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_masked_text2/flutter_masked_text2.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Masked Text Controller

You can create a `MaskedTextController` to manage the input field. Hereâ€™s how to set it up for a phone number:

```dart
final phoneController = MaskedTextController(mask: '(000) 000-0000');
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow for certain permissions, especially if you are accessing device features.

## Step 4: Creating the Input Field

You can now create a `TextField` using the `MaskedTextController`:

```dart
TextField(
  controller: phoneController,
  keyboardType: TextInputType.phone,
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    labelText: 'Phone Number',
    hintText: '(123) 456-7890',
  ),
),
```

This will create a text field that formats the input as the user types, guiding them to enter a valid phone number format.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we covered how to set up the `flutter_masked_text2` package in your Flutter application, including adding the dependency, importing the package, and creating a masked input field. With these steps, you can enhance your application's data input capabilities significantly.

# Complete Example of flutter_masked_text2

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_masked_text2/flutter_masked_text2.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Masked Text Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Home widget
    );
  }
}

// Main widget for the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create a MaskedTextController for phone number input
  final phoneController = MaskedTextController(mask: '(000) 000-0000');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Masked Text Input'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // TextField for phone number input
            TextField(
              controller: phoneController,
              keyboardType: TextInputType.phone,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Phone Number',
                hintText: '(123) 456-7890',
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to print the entered phone number
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Print the formatted phone number to console
                print('Entered Phone Number: ${phoneController.text}');
              },
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, setting RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. In RealFlutter, a MaskedTextController is created to format phone number input.
// 4. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing a TextField and a button.
// 5. The TextField uses the MaskedTextController to format user input as a phone number.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the entered phone number is printed to the console.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this complete example, we created a simple Flutter application that utilizes the `flutter_masked_text2` package to format phone number input. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the app, sets up a masked text input field, and allows the user to submit their input, which is then printed to the console. This demonstrates the key features of the package effectively.
