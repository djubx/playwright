# ej_selector Flutter Package

The `ej_selector` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers, designed to simplify the process of creating customizable selection widgets. This package is particularly useful when you need to allow users to select from a list of options, such as dropdowns, radio buttons, or checkboxes, with enhanced styling and functionality.

## When to Use `ej_selector`

You might consider using the `ej_selector` package in scenarios such as:

- Building forms that require user input from a predefined list of options.
- Implementing filters in applications that require user selection from multiple categories.

## Features

- **Customizable UI**: The package allows for extensive customization of the selection widgets, enabling developers to match the app's design.
- **Multiple Selection Modes**: Supports single and multiple selection modes, making it versatile for various use cases.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `ej_selector`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `ej_selector` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ej_selector: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using `ej_selector` in Your Flutter App

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `ej_selector` package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:ej_selector/ej_selector.dart';
```

2. Create a selection widget using `ej_selector`:

```dart
EjSelector(
  options: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
  onChanged: (selected) {
    print('Selected: $selected');
  },
);
```

This widget will display a list of options, and when an option is selected, it will print the selected value to the console.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `ej_selector` package in your Flutter application. You can customize the appearance and behavior further based on your requirements.

# Complete Example of `ej_selector`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ej_selector/ej_selector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'ej_selector Example',
      home: SelectorExample(),
    );
  }
}

class SelectorExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SelectorExampleState createState() => _SelectorExampleState();
}

class _SelectorExampleState extends State<SelectorExample> {
  // Variable to hold the selected option
  String? selectedOption;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('ej_selector Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected option
            Text(
              selectedOption != null ? 'Selected: $selectedOption' : 'No option selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // EjSelector widget for user selection
            EjSelector(
              options: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
              onChanged: (selected) {
                // Update the selected option state
                setState(() {
                  selectedOption = selected;
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to SelectorExample.
// 3. SelectorExample is a StatefulWidget that maintains the selected option state.
// 4. In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains a Column that displays the currently selected option.
// 6. EjSelector is instantiated with a list of options and an onChanged callback.
// 7. When an option is selected, the onChanged callback updates the selectedOption state.
// 8. The UI is rebuilt to reflect the selected option, displaying it in the Text widget.
```
