# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using textfield_datepicker

## Installation
To use the `textfield_datepicker` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  textfield_datepicker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/textfield_datepicker).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `textfield_datepicker`, you can create a simple Flutter widget that incorporates the date picker. Below is a basic example of how to implement it in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:textfield_datepicker/textfield_datepicker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Date Picker Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: DatePickerField(
            labelText: 'Select Date',
            onDateSelected: (date) {
              // Handle the selected date
              print('Selected date: $date');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a date picker field. The `onDateSelected` callback allows you to handle the selected date.

# Complete Example of textfield_datepicker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:textfield_datepicker/textfield_datepicker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Date Picker Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: DatePickerField(
            labelText: 'Select Date',
            onDateSelected: (date) {
              // Handle the selected date
              print('Selected date: $date');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Date Picker Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Padding widget to provide some space around the DatePickerField.
// 5. The DatePickerField is created with a label 'Select Date'.
// 6. When a date is selected, the onDateSelected callback is triggered, printing the selected date to the console.
// 7. This simple structure allows users to select a date easily, demonstrating the core functionality of the textfield_datepicker package.
