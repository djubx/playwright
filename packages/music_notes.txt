# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Music Notes Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **music_notes** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  music_notes: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to use audio playback features. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio playback.</string>
<key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your music library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to render musical notes and play them back.

# Complete Example: Music Notes Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:music_notes/music_notes.dart'; // Import the music_notes package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Music Notes Example',
      home: MusicNotesHome(), // Set the home widget
    );
  }
}

class MusicNotesHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MusicNotesHomeState createState() => _MusicNotesHomeState();
}

class _MusicNotesHomeState extends State<MusicNotesHome> {
  // Initialize a list of notes to display
  final List<Note> notes = [
    Note.C4,
    Note.E4,
    Note.G4,
    Note.C5,
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Music Notes'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Render the musical notes
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: notes.map((note) {
                return Padding(
                  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                  child: MusicNoteWidget(note: note), // Display each note
                );
              }).toList(),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Play the notes when the button is pressed
                playNotes();
              },
              child: Text('Play Notes'), // Button to play notes
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void playNotes() {
    // Loop through each note and play it
    for (var note in notes) {
      note.play(); // Play the note
    }
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the music_notes package.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (MusicNotesHome).
// 3. The MusicNotesHome widget is a stateful widget that maintains a list of musical notes (C4, E4, G4, C5).
// 4. In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Row of MusicNoteWidgets.
// 5. Each note is displayed with padding, and an ElevatedButton is provided to play the notes.
// 6. The playNotes method loops through the notes and plays each one when the button is pressed.
// 
// This simple application showcases how to render musical notes and play them back using the music_notes package.
```
