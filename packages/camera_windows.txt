# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Camera Windows Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `camera_windows` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `camera_windows` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  camera_windows: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/camera_windows).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Windows Configuration

1. **Enable Camera Permissions**: Ensure that your application has permission to access the camera. You may need to modify the `Package.appxmanifest` file in your Windows project to include the webcam capability:

   ```xml
   <Capabilities>
       <Capability Name="internetClient" />
       <DeviceCapability Name="webcam" />
   </Capabilities>
   ```

2. **Set Up the Camera**: Initialize the camera in your Flutter application. You can do this in your main widget or a dedicated camera service class.

### Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your application.

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:camera_windows/camera_windows.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize the Camera**:

   You can create a method to initialize the camera and handle any errors that may occur.

   ```dart
   Future<void> initializeCamera() async {
     try {
       // Get the list of available cameras
       final cameras = await CameraWindows.getCameras();
       // Select the first camera
       final camera = cameras.first;
       // Initialize the camera
       await camera.initialize();
     } catch (e) {
       print('Error initializing camera: $e');
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Capture an Image**:

   To capture an image, you can use the following method:

   ```dart
   Future<void> captureImage(Camera camera) async {
     try {
       final image = await camera.takePicture();
       print('Image captured: ${image.path}');
     } catch (e) {
       print('Error capturing image: $e');
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Stream Video**:

   To stream video, you can use the following method:

   ```dart
   void startVideoStream(Camera camera) {
     camera.startVideoStream();
   }
   ```

5. **Stop Video Stream**:

   To stop the video stream, use:

   ```dart
   void stopVideoStream(Camera camera) {
     camera.stopVideoStream();
   }
   ```

With these steps, you can successfully set up and use the `camera_windows` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example: Using Camera Windows in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:camera_windows/camera_windows.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  Camera? _camera; // Variable to hold the camera instance
  bool _isCameraInitialized = false; // Flag to check if the camera is initialized

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    initializeCamera(); // Initialize the camera when the app starts
  }

  // Method to initialize the camera
  Future<void> initializeCamera() async {
    try {
      // Get the list of available cameras
      final cameras = await CameraWindows.getCameras();
      // Select the first camera
      _camera = cameras.first;
      // Initialize the camera
      await _camera!.initialize();
      setState(() {
        _isCameraInitialized = true; // Update the state to reflect camera initialization
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error initializing camera: $e'); // Handle any errors
    }
  }

  // Method to capture an image
  Future<void> captureImage() async {
    if (_camera != null) {
      try {
        final image = await _camera!.takePicture(); // Capture the image
        print('Image captured: ${image.path}'); // Print the image path
      } catch (e) {
        print('Error capturing image: $e'); // Handle any errors
      }
    }
  }

  // Method to start video streaming
  void startVideoStream() {
    if (_camera != null) {
      _camera!.startVideoStream(); // Start streaming video
    }
  }

  // Method to stop video streaming
  void stopVideoStream() {
    if (_camera != null) {
      _camera!.stopVideoStream(); // Stop streaming video
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Camera Windows Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: _isCameraInitialized
              ? Column(
                  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                  children: [
                    ElevatedButton(
                      onPressed: captureImage, // Capture image on button press
                      child: Text('Capture Image'),
                    ),
                    ElevatedButton(
                      onPressed: startVideoStream, // Start video stream on button press
                      child: Text('Start Video Stream'),
                    ),
                    ElevatedButton(
                      onPressed: stopVideoStream, // Stop video stream on button press
                      child: Text('Stop Video Stream'),
                    ),
                  ],
                )
              : CircularProgressIndicator(), // Show loading indicator while initializing
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// In the `initState` method, the `initializeCamera` method is called to set up the camera.
// The `initializeCamera` method retrieves the list of available cameras and initializes the first one.
// Once the camera is initialized, the `_isCameraInitialized` flag is set to true, which updates the UI.
// The UI displays buttons for capturing an image, starting video streaming, and stopping video streaming.
// When the "Capture Image" button is pressed, the `captureImage` method is called, which captures an image and prints its path.
// The "Start Video Stream" button starts the video stream, while the "Stop Video Stream" button stops it.
// If the camera is not initialized, a loading indicator is shown until the camera is ready.
