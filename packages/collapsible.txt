Here's a detailed technical blog on the "collapsible" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Collapsible Flutter Package

The **collapsible** Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to create collapsible widgets in their Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for creating expandable lists, accordions, or any UI component that requires a section to be hidden or shown based on user interaction. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the collapsible package in scenarios such as:
- **Settings Pages**: Where users can expand or collapse sections to view more options.
- **FAQs**: To allow users to click on questions to reveal answers without overwhelming them with information.
- **Dynamic Content**: In applications where content can be lengthy, collapsible sections can help manage space and improve user experience.

## Features
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter widgets.
- **Customizable**: Allows for customization of animations, colors, and styles.
- **Responsive**: Works well on both Android and iOS platforms, adapting to different screen sizes.

In summary, the collapsible package enhances the user interface by providing a clean and organized way to display information, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Collapsible Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the collapsible package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  collapsible: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the collapsible package:

```dart
import 'package:collapsible/collapsible.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Collapsible Widget
You can now use the `Collapsible` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
Collapsible(
  header: Text('Click to Expand'),
  content: Text('This is the content that can be expanded or collapsed.'),
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customization
You can customize the appearance and behavior of the collapsible widget. For example, you can change the animation duration or the color of the header:

```dart
Collapsible(
  header: Text('Click to Expand', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue)),
  content: Text('This is the content that can be expanded or collapsed.'),
  animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
)
```

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the collapsible package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Using the Collapsible Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:collapsible/collapsible.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Collapsible Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Collapsible Widget Example'),
        ),
        body: CollapsibleExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CollapsibleExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      children: [
        // Creating a collapsible section
        Collapsible(
          header: Text('Section 1', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
          content: Text('This is the content of section 1. It can be expanded or collapsed.'),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 10), // Adding space between sections
        Collapsible(
          header: Text('Section 2', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
          content: Text('This is the content of section 2. It can be expanded or collapsed.'),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 10), // Adding space between sections
        Collapsible(
          header: Text('Section 3', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
          content: Text('This is the content of section 3. It can be expanded or collapsed.'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and the CollapsibleExample widget.
// 3. The CollapsibleExample widget builds a ListView with multiple Collapsible sections.
// 4. Each Collapsible section has a header and content. When the header is tapped, the content expands or collapses.
// 5. The UI is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, providing a clean and organized way to display information.
```
