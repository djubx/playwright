# Focus Detector Flutter Package

The **focus_detector** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers manage and respond to focus changes in their applications. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where user interaction is critical, such as in forms, games, or any application that requires attention to specific UI elements.

## When to Use

You might consider using the **focus_detector** package in the following scenarios:

- **Form Validation**: To trigger validation when a user focuses on or leaves a form field.
- **User Engagement**: To track when users focus on specific parts of your app, allowing for analytics on user behavior.
- **Dynamic UI Changes**: To change the UI dynamically based on user focus, such as highlighting fields or showing tooltips.

## Features

- **Focus Detection**: Detects when a widget gains or loses focus.
- **Custom Callbacks**: Allows developers to define custom actions when focus changes occur.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, the **focus_detector** package enhances user experience by providing responsive and interactive UI elements based on user focus.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Focus Detector Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **focus_detector** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  focus_detector: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Typically, no special permissions are required for focus detection, but ensure your app's minimum SDK version is compatible.

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to adjust your `Info.plist` file if you are using any features that require permissions. However, basic focus detection does not require additional configurations.

## Step 3: Using the Focus Detector

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement focus detection in a text field.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:focus_detector/focus_detector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Focus Detector Example')),
        body: FocusDetector(
          onFocusGained: () {
            print('Focus Gained!');
          },
          onFocusLost: () {
            print('Focus Lost!');
          },
          child: Center(
            child: TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
                labelText: 'Enter Text',
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, the `FocusDetector` widget wraps a `TextField`. It listens for focus changes and prints messages to the console when the field gains or loses focus.

# Complete Example of Focus Detector in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:focus_detector/focus_detector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Focus Detector Example')),
        body: FocusDetector(
          // Callback when the widget gains focus
          onFocusGained: () {
            print('Focus Gained!'); // Log focus gained
          },
          // Callback when the widget loses focus
          onFocusLost: () {
            print('Focus Lost!'); // Log focus lost
          },
          child: Center(
            child: TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
                labelText: 'Enter Text', // Label for the text field
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains a FocusDetector that wraps a TextField.
// 5. When the TextField gains focus, the onFocusGained callback is triggered, logging "Focus Gained!" to the console.
// 6. When the TextField loses focus, the onFocusLost callback is triggered, logging "Focus Lost!" to the console.
// 7. This allows developers to respond to focus changes dynamically, enhancing user interaction.
