# Flash Image Flutter Package

The **flash_image** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance their image loading experience. It provides a simple and efficient way to display images with a smooth transition effect, making it ideal for applications that require dynamic image loading, such as social media apps, galleries, or any app that frequently updates images.

## When to Use This Package
- When you need to load images from the network or local storage with a smooth transition.
- For applications that require placeholder images while the main image is loading.
- When you want to improve user experience by providing visual feedback during image loading.

## Key Features
- **Smooth Transitions**: Provides a fade-in effect when images are loaded.
- **Placeholder Support**: Allows you to set a placeholder image while the main image is being fetched.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error widget if the image fails to load.
- **Caching**: Supports caching of images to improve performance and reduce network calls.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flash Image

## Installation
To use the **flash_image** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flash_image: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flash_image).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions for network access in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `FlashImage` widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flash_image/flash_image.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flash Image Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FlashImage(
            image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image.jpg'),
            placeholder: AssetImage('assets/placeholder.png'),
            errorBuilder: (context, error, stackTrace) {
              return Icon(Icons.error);
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays an image from a network source. The `FlashImage` widget handles the loading and error states seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Flash Image

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flash_image/flash_image.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flash Image Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using FlashImage to load an image with a placeholder and error handling
          child: FlashImage(
            // Network image URL
            image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image.jpg'),
            // Placeholder image while the main image is loading
            placeholder: AssetImage('assets/placeholder.png'),
            // Error widget to display if the image fails to load
            errorBuilder: (context, error, stackTrace) {
              return Icon(Icons.error); // Display an error icon
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}
```

// The application starts by running the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// Inside the Center widget, we use the `FlashImage` widget to load an image from a network source.
// The `FlashImage` widget takes three parameters:
// 1. `image`: The image to be loaded, in this case, a network image.
// 2. `placeholder`: An asset image that is displayed while the main image is loading.
// 3. `errorBuilder`: A function that returns a widget to display if the image fails to load, here we use an error icon.
// This setup provides a smooth user experience with visual feedback during image loading.
