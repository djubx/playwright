# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using aws_s3_upload

## Installation
To get started with the `aws_s3_upload` package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  aws_s3_upload: ^latest_version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
    }
}
```

2. Add internet permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions for file access.

## Usage
To use the package, you need to initialize it with your AWS credentials and S3 bucket information. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to upload a file:

```dart
import 'package:aws_s3_upload/aws_s3_upload.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final String bucket = 'your-bucket-name';
  final String region = 'your-region';
  final String accessKey = 'your-access-key';
  final String secretKey = 'your-secret-key';

  Future<void> uploadFile(String filePath) async {
    try {
      // Create an instance of S3Upload
      final s3Upload = S3Upload(
        bucket: bucket,
        region: region,
        accessKey: accessKey,
        secretKey: secretKey,
      );

      // Upload the file
      final result = await s3Upload.uploadFile(filePath);
      print('File uploaded: $result');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error uploading file: $e');
    }
  }
}
```

This code initializes the S3 upload process and uploads a file from the specified path.

# Complete Example of Using aws_s3_upload

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:aws_s3_upload/aws_s3_upload.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AWS S3 Upload Example',
      home: UploadScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class UploadScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _UploadScreenState createState() => _UploadScreenState();
}

class _UploadScreenState extends State<UploadScreen> {
  final String bucket = 'your-bucket-name';
  final String region = 'your-region';
  final String accessKey = 'your-access-key';
  final String secretKey = 'your-secret-key';

  // Function to upload file
  Future<void> uploadFile(String filePath) async {
    try {
      // Create an instance of S3Upload
      final s3Upload = S3Upload(
        bucket: bucket,
        region: region,
        accessKey: accessKey,
        secretKey: secretKey,
      );

      // Upload the file
      final result = await s3Upload.uploadFile(filePath);
      print('File uploaded: $result');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error uploading file: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Upload to S3'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Call the upload function with a sample file path
            uploadFile('/path/to/your/file.jpg');
          },
          child: Text('Upload File'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// MyApp sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen, UploadScreen.
// UploadScreen is a stateful widget that manages the upload process.
// It initializes AWS S3 credentials and has a method to upload files.
// When the user presses the "Upload File" button, the uploadFile method is called.
// This method creates an instance of S3Upload and attempts to upload the specified file.
// If successful, it prints the result; if there's an error, it prints the error message.
