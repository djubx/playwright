class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Argon Buttons Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ArgonButton(
          height: 50,
          width: 150,
          color: Colors.blue,
          borderRadius: 5.0,
          child: Text(
            "Press Me",
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
          ),
          onTap: (startLoading, stopLoading, btnState) {
            // Handle button tap
            startLoading();
            Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
              stopLoading();
            });
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a single Argon button that shows a loading state when pressed.

# Complete Example: Argon Buttons in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:argon_buttons_flutter_fix/argon_buttons_flutter_fix.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Argon Buttons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Argon Buttons Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ArgonButton(
            height: 50, // Set the height of the button
            width: 150, // Set the width of the button
            color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the button
            borderRadius: 5.0, // Border radius for rounded corners
            child: Text(
              "Press Me", // Text displayed on the button
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white), // Text color
            ),
            onTap: (startLoading, stopLoading, btnState) {
              // This function is called when the button is tapped
              startLoading(); // Start the loading animation
              Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
                // Simulate a network call or some processing
                stopLoading(); // Stop the loading animation after 2 seconds
              });
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Argon Buttons Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers an ArgonButton widget.
// 5. The ArgonButton is configured with height, width, color, and text.
// 6. When the button is tapped, it triggers the onTap callback, starting a loading animation.
// 7. After a delay of 2 seconds, the loading animation stops, simulating a network call or processing.
