- **Filtering Options**: When users need to filter data based on multiple criteria.
- **Tag Selection**: In applications where users can select multiple tags or categories.
- **Complex Forms**: When building forms that require multiple selections, such as survey forms or product filters.

## Features

- **Customizable UI**: The package allows for extensive customization of the selection interface.
- **Easy Integration**: It can be easily integrated into existing Flutter applications.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

Overall, the `multiselect_scope` package provides a user-friendly and efficient way to implement multi-selection features in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Multiselect Scope

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `multiselect_scope` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  multiselect_scope: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `multiselect_scope` in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:multiselect_scope/multiselect_scope.dart';
```

2. Create a list of items that you want to display for selection:

```dart
final List<String> items = ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3', 'Option 4'];
```

3. Use the `MultiSelectScope` widget in your UI:

```dart
MultiSelectScope(
  items: items,
  onSelectionChanged: (selectedItems) {
    // Handle the selected items
    print(selectedItems);
  },
);
```

This basic setup will allow users to select multiple options from the provided list. You can customize the appearance and behavior further based on your application's requirements.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `multiselect_scope` package into your Flutter application successfully.

# Complete Example of Multiselect Scope

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:multiselect_scope/multiselect_scope.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Multiselect Scope Example',
      home: MultiSelectExample(),
    );
  }
}

class MultiSelectExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MultiSelectExampleState createState() => _MultiSelectExampleState();
}

class _MultiSelectExampleState extends State<MultiSelectExample> {
  // List of items to be displayed for selection
  final List<String> items = ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3', 'Option 4'];
  
  // Variable to hold selected items
  List<String> selectedItems = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Multiselect Scope Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected items
            Text('Selected Items: ${selectedItems.join(', ')}'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // MultiSelectScope widget for selecting multiple items
            MultiSelectScope(
              items: items,
              onSelectionChanged: (newSelection) {
                // Update the selected items when the selection changes
                setState(() {
                  selectedItems = newSelection;
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget, MultiSelectExample.
// 3. MultiSelectExample is a stateful widget that maintains the state of selected items.
// 4. In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a Text widget displaying the currently selected items and a MultiSelectScope widget.
// 6. When the user selects or deselects items in the MultiSelectScope, the onSelectionChanged callback is triggered.
// 7. This callback updates the selectedItems list and rebuilds the UI to reflect the changes.
