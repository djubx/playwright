<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for file access:

```xml

## Using the Package
To use the **utopia_save_file** package, you can follow these steps in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:utopia_save_file/utopia_save_file.dart';

```dart
void saveMyFile() async {
  final result = await UtopiaSaveFile.saveFile(

# Complete Example of Utopia Save File

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:utopia_save_file/utopia_save_file.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Utopia Save File Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Utopia Save File Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Call the method to save a file when the button is pressed
              saveMyFile();
            },
            child: Text('Save File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to save a file using the Utopia Save File package
  void saveMyFile() async {
    // Attempt to save a file with the specified name and data
    final result = await UtopiaSaveFile.saveFile(
      fileName: 'example.txt', // Name of the file to save
      data: 'Hello, Utopia!',   // Content to be saved in the file
    );

    // Check if the file was saved successfully
    if (result) {
      // If successful, show a success message
      print('File saved successfully!');
    } else {
      // If failed, show an error message
      print('Failed to save file.');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple UI.
// 3. The UI consists of an AppBar and a Center widget containing an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the saveMyFile method is called.
// 5. The saveMyFile method attempts to save a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, Utopia!'.
// 6. If the file is saved successfully, a success message is printed to the console; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
