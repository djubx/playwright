# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Typing Text Animation Package

## Installation
To use the `typing_text_animation` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  typing_text_animation: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the latest version of Xcode and that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Basic Usage
To use the `typing_text_animation` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:typing_text_animation/typing_text_animation.dart';
```

You can then create a simple widget that utilizes the typing animation. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
TypingTextAnimation(
  text: 'Hello, Flutter!',
  speed: Duration(milliseconds: 100),
  textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.blue),
)
```

This will create a typing animation for the text "Hello, Flutter!" with a speed of 100 milliseconds per character.

Now you are ready to implement the typing text animation in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Typing Text Animation

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:typing_text_animation/typing_text_animation.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Typing Text Animation Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Typing Text Animation'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Typing animation for the first line of text
              TypingTextAnimation(
                text: 'Welcome to RealFlutter!',
                speed: Duration(milliseconds: 100), // Speed of typing
                textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.blue), // Text style
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between texts
              // Typing animation for the second line of text
              TypingTextAnimation(
                text: 'Let\'s explore Flutter packages.',
                speed: Duration(milliseconds: 150), // Speed of typing
                textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.green), // Text style
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// Inside the Scaffold, we have an AppBar with the title "Typing Text Animation".
// The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// We use a Column widget to stack the typing animations vertically.
// The first TypingTextAnimation displays "Welcome to RealFlutter!" with a blue color and a typing speed of 100 milliseconds.
// A SizedBox is used to create space between the two animations.
// The second TypingTextAnimation displays "Let's explore Flutter packages." with a green color and a typing speed of 150 milliseconds.
// This setup creates an engaging introduction to the app using typing animations.
