# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using ts_paginated_list

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `ts_paginated_list` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Package to Your Project
To use the `ts_paginated_list` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ts_paginated_list: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ts_paginated_list).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage
Now that the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a paginated list.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ts_paginated_list/ts_paginated_list.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Paginated List Example',
      home: PaginatedListExample(),
    );
  }
}

class PaginatedListExample extends StatelessWidget {
  // Simulated data fetching function
  Future<List<String>> fetchData(int page, int limit) async {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2)); // Simulate network delay
    return List.generate(limit, (index) => 'Item ${index + 1 + (page * limit)}');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Paginated List')),
      body: TsPaginatedList<String>(
        fetchData: (page, limit) => fetchData(page, limit), // Fetch data function
        itemBuilder: (context, item) {
          return ListTile(title: Text(item)); // Build list item
        },
        loadingIndicator: Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()), // Loading indicator
        errorWidget: Center(child: Text('Error fetching data')), // Error widget
        pageSize: 10, // Number of items per page
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and home page.
// 3. The PaginatedListExample widget is created, which contains the paginated list.
// 4. The fetchData function simulates fetching data from a server with a delay.
// 5. The TsPaginatedList widget is used to create a paginated list view.
// 6. The fetchData function is passed to TsPaginatedList to load data.
// 7. The itemBuilder is used to define how each item in the list should be displayed.
// 8. A loading indicator and error widget are provided for better user experience.
// 9. The pageSize is set to 10, meaning 10 items will be loaded per page.
```
