# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Tencent Cloud Chat UIKit

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `tencent_cloud_chat_uikit` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `tencent_cloud_chat_uikit` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tencent_cloud_chat_uikit: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
        ...
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Initialize the SDK

Before using the chat functionalities, you need to initialize the Tencent Cloud SDK in your main application file. Here’s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tencent_cloud_chat_uikit/tencent_cloud_chat_uikit.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize the Tencent Cloud Chat SDK
  TencentCloudChatUIKit.init(appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID');
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

Replace `YOUR_APP_ID` with your actual Tencent Cloud App ID.

## Step 4: Using the Chat UI Components

You can now use the chat UI components provided by the package. Here’s a simple example of how to create a chat screen:

```dart
class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Chat')),
      body: ChatView(
        conversationID: 'YOUR_CONVERSATION_ID',
        onSendMessage: (message) {
          // Handle sending message
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_CONVERSATION_ID` with the ID of the conversation you want to display.

With these steps, you have successfully set up the `tencent_cloud_chat_uikit` package in your Flutter application and are ready to implement chat functionalities.

# Complete Example of a Flutter Application Using Tencent Cloud Chat UIKit

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tencent_cloud_chat_uikit/tencent_cloud_chat_uikit.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize the Tencent Cloud Chat SDK with your App ID
  TencentCloudChatUIKit.init(appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID');
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Chat App',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: ChatScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Chat')),
      body: ChatView(
        conversationID: 'YOUR_CONVERSATION_ID',
        onSendMessage: (message) {
          // Handle sending message
          print('Message sent: $message');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter application and the Tencent Cloud Chat SDK.
// 2. The MyApp class sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The ChatScreen class builds the chat interface with an AppBar and a ChatView.
// 4. The ChatView is responsible for displaying the chat messages and handling message sending.
// 5. When a message is sent, the onSendMessage callback is triggered, allowing you to handle the message (e.g., send it to the server).
// 6. Replace 'YOUR_APP_ID' and 'YOUR_CONVERSATION_ID' with your actual Tencent Cloud App ID and conversation ID to make the app functional.
```
