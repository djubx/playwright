# Complete Example of Using Color Picker Field

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:color_picker_field/color_picker_field.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Color Picker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ColorPickerHome(),
    );
  }
}

class ColorPickerHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ColorPickerHomeState createState() => _ColorPickerHomeState();
}

class _ColorPickerHomeState extends State<ColorPickerHome> {
  // Variable to hold the selected color
  Color selectedColor = Colors.blue;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Color Picker Field Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected color
            Container(
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              color: selectedColor,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Selected Color',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Color Picker Field
            ColorPickerField(
              // Initial color
              initialColor: selectedColor,
              // Callback when color is changed
              onColorChanged: (color) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedColor = color; // Update the selected color
                });
              },
              // Optional: Customize the field
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Pick a Color',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is ColorPickerHome, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. Inside ColorPickerHome, we define a variable to hold the selected color.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. A Container displays the currently selected color.
// 7. The ColorPickerField widget allows users to pick a color.
// 8. When the user selects a color, the onColorChanged callback updates the selected color state.
// 9. The UI updates to reflect the new selected color in real-time.
```
