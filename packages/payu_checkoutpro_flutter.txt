# Tutorial: Setting Up payu_checkoutpro_flutter

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `payu_checkoutpro_flutter` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `payu_checkoutpro_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  payu_checkoutpro_flutter: ^latest_version
```
Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/payu_checkoutpro_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initiate a payment.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:payu_checkoutpro_flutter/payu_checkoutpro_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PayU Checkout Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Initialize the payment process
              PayUCheckoutPro.startPayment(
                merchantKey: 'your_merchant_key',
                amount: '10.00',
                transactionId: 'txn123456',
                // Additional parameters can be added here
              ).then((result) {
                // Handle the payment result
                if (result['status'] == 'success') {
                  // Payment was successful
                  print('Payment Successful: ${result['message']}');
                } else {
                  // Payment failed
                  print('Payment Failed: ${result['message']}');
                }
              });
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that initiates the payment process when pressed.

                // Additional parameters can be added here
              ).then((result) {
                // Handle the payment result
                if (result['status'] == 'success') {
                  // Payment was successful
                  print('Payment Successful: ${result['message']}');
                } else {
                  // Payment failed
                  print('Payment Failed: ${result['message']}');
                }
              });
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with a MaterialApp widget that contains a Scaffold.
// 2. An AppBar is created with the title 'PayU Checkout Example'.
// 3. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. An ElevatedButton is displayed with the text 'Pay Now'.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the `startPayment` method from the PayUCheckoutPro class is called.
// 6. The payment process is initiated with the provided merchant key, amount, and transaction ID.
// 7. The result of the payment is handled in a callback function.
// 8. If the payment is successful, a success message is printed; otherwise, a failure message is shown.
