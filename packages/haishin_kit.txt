Here's a detailed technical blog on the "haishin_kit" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Haishin Kit Flutter Package

The **haishin_kit** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed for real-time streaming applications. It provides a comprehensive set of features that enable developers to implement live streaming capabilities in their Flutter applications seamlessly. This package is particularly useful for applications that require video broadcasting, such as social media platforms, online gaming, and live event streaming.

## When to Use Haishin Kit

You should consider using the **haishin_kit** package when:
- You need to implement live video streaming in your Flutter app.
- You want to broadcast video from a mobile device to a server or other clients.
- You require support for various streaming protocols like RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol).

## Key Features
- **Real-time Streaming**: Supports low-latency streaming for real-time applications.
- **Multiple Protocols**: Compatible with RTMP, HLS, and other streaming protocols.
- **Customizable**: Offers a range of customizable options for video quality, resolution, and bitrate.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, making it versatile for mobile app development.

With these features, **haishin_kit** stands out as a robust solution for developers looking to integrate live streaming into their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Haishin Kit

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **haishin_kit** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **haishin_kit** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  haishin_kit: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request camera and microphone permissions:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for streaming.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for streaming.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using Haishin Kit

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a basic streaming functionality.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example: RealFlutter Streaming App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:haishin_kit/haishin_kit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a controller for the streaming
  late final RTMPPublisher _publisher;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the RTMP publisher
    _publisher = RTMPPublisher();
    // Set the stream URL (replace with your RTMP server URL)
    _publisher.url = 'rtmp://your.rtmp.server/live/stream';
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the publisher when the widget is removed
    _publisher.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('RealFlutter Streaming App'),
        ),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            // Display the preview of the camera
            Expanded(
              child: CameraPreview(_publisher),
            ),
            // Button to start streaming
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Start streaming
                _publisher.start();
              },
              child: Text('Start Streaming'),
            ),
            // Button to stop streaming
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Stop streaming
                _publisher.stop();
              },
              child: Text('Stop Streaming'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we create an RTMPPublisher instance to handle streaming.
// 3. The publisher's URL is set to the RTMP server where the stream will be sent.
// 4. The CameraPreview widget displays the camera feed, allowing users to see what they are streaming.
// 5. Two buttons are provided: one to start streaming and another to stop streaming.
// 6. When the user presses the "Start Streaming" button, the publisher starts sending the video feed to the specified RTMP server.
// 7. When the user presses the "Stop Streaming" button, the publisher stops the stream and releases resources.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that utilizes the **haishin_kit** package to stream video. The application initializes an RTMP publisher, displays a camera preview, and provides buttons to start and stop the streaming process. 

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application initializes the RTMP publisher and sets the streaming URL.
- The camera preview is displayed to the user.
- Users can start and stop the stream using the provided buttons, which control the publisher's streaming state.

This structure provides a comprehensive overview of the **haishin_kit** package, guiding users through setup, usage, and a complete example to get started with live streaming in Flutter.
