## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the **interactable_svg** package in scenarios such as:
- Creating interactive icons or buttons that respond to user gestures.
- Building complex animations that require vector graphics.
- Developing educational apps where SVG diagrams need to be interactive.
- Implementing custom graphics that need to scale without losing quality.

## Features

- **Interactive Elements**: Easily add touch events to SVG elements.
- **Animation Support**: Animate SVG properties like color, size, and position.
- **Customizable**: Modify SVG properties dynamically based on user interactions.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

With these features, the **interactable_svg** package provides a robust solution for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with interactive graphics.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Interactable SVG

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **interactable_svg** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  interactable_svg: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/interactable_svg).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of SVG files by adding the following to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:interactable_svg/interactable_svg.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the **interactable_svg** package to create interactive SVG graphics. Below is a simple example of how to implement an interactive SVG in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Interactable SVG

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:interactable_svg/interactable_svg.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Interactable SVG Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Interactable SVG Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: InteractiveSvgExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class InteractiveSvgExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return InteractableSvg(
      // Load your SVG file here
      asset: 'assets/example.svg',
      // Define the interaction
      onTap: () {
        // Action to perform on tap
        print('SVG tapped!');
      },
      // Define the animation
      onHover: (isHovered) {
        // Change color on hover
        return isHovered ? Colors.blue : Colors.red;
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains the InteractiveSvgExample widget.
// 4. InteractiveSvgExample uses the InteractableSvg widget to load an SVG asset and define interactions.
// 5. When the SVG is tapped, a message is printed to the console.
// 6. The SVG changes color based on hover state, providing visual feedback to the user.
```
