# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Pretty String Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **pretty_string** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pretty_string: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to format a string using the **pretty_string** package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pretty_string/pretty_string.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pretty String Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            PrettyString("Hello, World!").bold().color(Colors.blue).toString(),
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the **pretty_string** package and use it to create a bold, blue string that is displayed in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of Using the Pretty String Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pretty_string/pretty_string.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pretty String Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Pretty String Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Using PrettyString to format text
              Text(
                PrettyString("Welcome to Pretty String!").bold().color(Colors.green).toString(),
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between texts
              Text(
                PrettyString("This is a demo of the package.").italic().color(Colors.red).toString(),
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between texts
              Text(
                PrettyString("Enjoy formatting your strings!").underline().color(Colors.purple).toString(),
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 22),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Pretty String Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column widget is used to arrange multiple Text widgets vertically.
// 6. Each Text widget uses the PrettyString class to format the string with different styles (bold, italic, underline) and colors.
// 7. SizedBox widgets are used to add space between the Text widgets for better readability.
