- When your application requires displaying images from local assets or file systems.
- When you want to implement placeholder images while the actual images are being loaded.

## Features

- **Flexible Image Loading**: Load images from various sources, including network, assets, and file paths.
- **Caching**: Automatically caches images to improve loading times and reduce network requests.
- **Error Handling**: Provides built-in error handling for failed image loads.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Image Loader Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **image_loader** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_loader: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow arbitrary loads if you are loading images from non-secure URLs. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Image Loader Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to load an image from a network URL and display it in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_loader/image_loader.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Image Loader Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ImageLoader(
            imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg', // Replace with your image URL
            placeholder: AssetImage('assets/placeholder.png'), // Local placeholder image
            errorWidget: Icon(Icons.error), // Widget to display on error
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example:
- We import the necessary packages.
- We create a `RealFlutter` class that extends `StatelessWidget`.
- Inside the `build` method, we use the `ImageLoader` widget to load an image from a URL, with a placeholder and error widget.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate the **image_loader** package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Image Loader Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_loader/image_loader.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Image Loader Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ImageLoader(
            imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg', // Replace with your image URL
            placeholder: AssetImage('assets/placeholder.png'), // Local placeholder image
            errorWidget: Icon(Icons.error), // Widget to display on error
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function initializes the app and takes the RealFlutter widget as the root widget.
// 3. The RealFlutter class builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title "Image Loader Example".
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. The ImageLoader widget is used to load an image from a specified URL.
// 7. While the image is loading, a placeholder image is displayed.
// 8. If the image fails to load, an error icon is shown.
// 9. This structure allows for a clean and efficient way to handle image loading in Flutter applications.
