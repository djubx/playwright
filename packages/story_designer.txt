# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "story_designer" Package

## Installation
To get started with the `story_designer` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  story_designer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/story_designer).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `story_designer` package, you can create a simple story layout in your Flutter application. Below is a basic example of how to implement it.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:story_designer/story_designer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: StoryPage(),
    );
  }
}

class StoryPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Story Designer Example')),
      body: StoryDesigner(
        story: [
          StoryElement(
            title: 'Welcome to the Story',
            content: 'This is the beginning of our journey.',
            onNext: () {
              // Navigate to the next story element
            },
          ),
          // Add more StoryElements as needed
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple story page with a title and content. The `onNext` callback can be used to navigate to the next part of the story.

# Complete Example of Using the "story_designer" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:story_designer/story_designer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Story Designer Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: StoryPage(),
    );
  }
}

class StoryPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Story Designer Example')),
      body: StoryDesigner(
        story: [
          StoryElement(
            title: 'Welcome to the Story',
            content: 'This is the beginning of our journey.',
            onNext: () {
              // Navigate to the next story element
              Navigator.push(
                context,
                MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => NextStoryPage()),
              );
            },
          ),
          // Additional story elements can be added here
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

class NextStoryPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Next Chapter')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is the next part of the story!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and points to the StoryPage as the home.
// 3. The StoryPage contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a StoryDesigner widget.
// 4. The StoryDesigner widget takes a list of StoryElements, each representing a part of the story.
// 5. The first StoryElement displays a title and content, with an onNext callback to navigate to the NextStoryPage.
// 6. The NextStoryPage is a simple page that displays additional content when navigated to.
