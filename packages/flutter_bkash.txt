# Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To use the `flutter_bkash` package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_bkash: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the following permissions and metadata in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>

    <application
        android:name=".MainApplication"
        android:label="your_app_name"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.bkash.app.clientId"
            android:value="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"/>
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.bkash.app.secretKey"
            android:value="YOUR_SECRET_KEY"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `build.gradle` file is set up correctly to support the package.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>YOUR_BKASH_URL_SCHEME</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `flutter_bkash` package, you can create a class named `RealFlutter` that handles the payment process. Below is a simple example of how to initiate a payment.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bkash/flutter_bkash.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('bKash Payment')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize bKash payment
              final result = await FlutterBkash.startPayment(
                amount: '100',
                intent: 'sale',
                // Additional parameters as required
              );

              // Handle the payment result
              if (result['status'] == 'success') {
                // Payment successful
                print('Payment Successful: ${result['transactionId']}');
              } else {
                // Payment failed
                print('Payment Failed: ${result['message']}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pay with bKash'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that initiates a bKash payment when pressed.

# Complete Example of RealFlutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bkash/flutter_bkash.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('bKash Payment')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize bKash payment
              final result = await FlutterBkash.startPayment(
                amount: '100', // Amount to be paid
                intent: 'sale', // Payment intent
                // Additional parameters as required
              );

              // Handle the payment result
              if (result['status'] == 'success') {
                // Payment successful
                print('Payment Successful: ${result['transactionId']}');
              } else {
                // Payment failed
                print('Payment Failed: ${result['message']}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pay with bKash'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled "Pay with bKash".
// 2. When the button is pressed, the `startPayment` method is called with the specified amount and intent.
// 3. The payment process is initiated, and the result is awaited.
// 4. If the payment is successful, the transaction ID is printed to the console.
// 5. If the payment fails, an error message is printed to the console.
```
