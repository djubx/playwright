      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a text field and a button.
// 2. The user enters their name in the text field.
// 3. The user clicks the button, which shows a dialog with a greeting message.
// 4. The user clicks the OK button to dismiss the dialog.
// The Adwaita theme is used throughout the app, providing a consistent and visually appealing design.
