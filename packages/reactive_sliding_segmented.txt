```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  reactive_sliding_segmented: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/reactive_sliding_segmented).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a segmented control using `reactive_sliding_segmented`.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:reactive_sliding_segmented/reactive_sliding_segmented.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the state of the segmented control.

3. Use the `ReactiveSlidingSegmented` widget to create the segmented control.

This will be demonstrated in the complete example section below.

# Complete Example of `reactive_sliding_segmented`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reactive_sliding_segmented/reactive_sliding_segmented.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the selected segment index
  int _selectedSegmentIndex = 0;

  // List of segment titles
  final List<String> _segmentTitles = ['Home', 'Profile', 'Settings'];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Reactive Sliding Segmented Example'),
        ),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            // ReactiveSlidingSegmented widget to create the segmented control
            ReactiveSlidingSegmented(
              // List of segments
              segments: _segmentTitles,
              // Current selected index
              currentIndex: _selectedSegmentIndex,
              // Callback when a segment is tapped
              onSegmentTapped: (index) {
                setState(() {
                  _selectedSegmentIndex = index; // Update the selected index
                });
              },
              // Customization options
              activeColor: Colors.blue,
              inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
              textStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
            ),
            // Display content based on the selected segment
            Expanded(
              child: _buildSegmentContent(_selectedSegmentIndex),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to build content based on the selected segment
  Widget _buildSegmentContent(int index) {
    switch (index) {
      case 0:
        return Center(child: Text('Home Content', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)));
      case 1:
        return Center(child: Text('Profile Content', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)));
      case 2:
        return Center(child: Text('Settings Content', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)));
      default:
        return Center(child: Text('Home Content', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)));
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected segment.
// 3. The _selectedSegmentIndex variable keeps track of which segment is currently selected.
// 4. The build method constructs the UI, including the ReactiveSlidingSegmented widget.
// 5. When a segment is tapped, the onSegmentTapped callback updates the selected index.
// 6. The _buildSegmentContent method returns different content based on the selected segment index.
// 7. The UI updates reactively, displaying the corresponding content for the selected segment.
