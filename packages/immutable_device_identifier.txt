// This is the main entry point of the app, where we create a MaterialApp and set the home to MyHomePage.
// We use the ImmutableDeviceIdentifier package to get the device identifier in the _getDeviceId method.
// The device identifier is then displayed on the screen using a Text widget.
// When the app starts, the _getDeviceId method is called in the initState method to get the device identifier.
// The device identifier is then updated on the screen using the setState method.

// The app flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app.
// 2. The _getDeviceId method is called in the initState method to get the device identifier.
// 3. The device identifier is obtained using the ImmutableDeviceIdentifier package.
// 4. The device identifier is updated on the screen using the setState method.
// 5. The user can view the device identifier on the screen.
