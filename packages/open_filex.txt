# Tutorial: Setting Up Open FileX

## Step 1: Adding Dependency

To get started with the **open_filex** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  open_filex: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/open_filex).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions added:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request permission to access files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to open files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to open files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to open a file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_filex/open_filex.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Open FileX Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Specify the file path
              String filePath = '/path/to/your/file.pdf';
              // Open the file
              var result = await OpenFilex.open(filePath);
              // Handle the result
              print(result.message);
            },
            child: Text('Open File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the specified file will be opened using the default application associated with that file type.

# Complete Example of Open FileX

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:open_filex/open_filex.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Open FileX Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Specify the file path
              String filePath = '/path/to/your/file.pdf'; // Change this to your file path
              // Open the file using open_filex
              var result = await OpenFilex.open(filePath);
              // Handle the result
              print(result.message); // Print the result message to the console
            },
            child: Text('Open File'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the app's visual layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers the onPressed callback.
// 6. Inside the onPressed callback, the file path is specified, pointing to the file to be opened.
// 7. The OpenFilex.open method is called with the file path, which attempts to open the file.
// 8. The result of the file opening attempt is captured, and a message is printed to the console, indicating success or failure.
```

In summary, the **open_filex** package provides a simple and effective way to open files in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, developers can easily integrate file opening capabilities into their apps, enhancing functionality and user experience.
