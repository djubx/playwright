// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user clicks the "Start Isolate" button, which calls the `_startIsolate` method.
// 2. The `_startIsolate` method creates a new isolate using the `UseIsolate` class.
// 3. In the new isolate, a loop is simulated to perform some work.
// 4. During each iteration of the loop, a message is sent to the main isolate using the `UseIsolate.send` method.
// 5. The main isolate listens for messages from the new isolate using the `UseIsolate.onMessage` callback.
// 6. When a message is received, the main isolate updates the UI by calling `setState`.
// 7. The UI is updated to display the received message.
