# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_download_manager

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_download_manager` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_download_manager` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_download_manager: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_download_manager).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, you need to ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save downloaded files.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio downloads.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video downloads.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to initiate a download, track its progress, and handle completion.

# Complete Example: Flutter Download Manager

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_download_manager/flutter_download_manager.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Download Manager Example',
      home: DownloadPage(),
    );
  }
}

class DownloadPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DownloadPageState createState() => _DownloadPageState();
}

class _DownloadPageState extends State<DownloadPage> {
  // Variable to hold the download progress
  double _progress = 0.0;

  // Function to start the download
  void _startDownload() async {
    // URL of the file to download
    String url = 'https://example.com/file.zip';
    // Path where the file will be saved
    String savePath = '/storage/emulated/0/Download/file.zip';

    // Start the download
    DownloadManager.startDownload(
      url: url,
      savePath: savePath,
      onDownloadProgress: (receivedBytes, totalBytes) {
        // Update the progress
        setState(() {
          _progress = receivedBytes / totalBytes;
        });
      },
      onDownloadComplete: () {
        // Handle download completion
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Download completed!')),
        );
      },
      onDownloadError: (error) {
        // Handle download error
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Download failed: $error')),
        );
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Download Manager Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the download progress
            LinearProgressIndicator(value: _progress),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to start the download
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startDownload,
              child: Text('Start Download'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The DownloadPage widget is displayed, containing a button to start the download and a progress indicator.
// 3. When the user presses the "Start Download" button, the _startDownload function is called.
// 4. The download is initiated using the DownloadManager.startDownload method, which takes the file URL and save path.
// 5. The onDownloadProgress callback updates the progress variable, which is reflected in the LinearProgressIndicator.
// 6. Upon completion, a SnackBar is shown to inform the user that the download is complete.
// 7. If an error occurs during the download, an error message is displayed in a SnackBar.
