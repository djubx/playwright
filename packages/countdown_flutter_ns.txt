# Countdown Flutter NS Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the `countdown_flutter_ns` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  countdown_flutter_ns: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/countdown_flutter_ns).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow for background execution if your countdown needs to run while the app is in the background. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `countdown_flutter_ns` package, you can create a simple countdown timer in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:countdown_flutter_ns/countdown_flutter_ns.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Countdown Timer Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Countdown(
            duration: Duration(seconds: 10), // Set countdown duration
            onFinish: () {
              // Action to perform when countdown finishes
              print('Countdown finished!');
            },
            builder: (context, time) {
              // Display the countdown timer
              return Text(
                '${time.inSeconds} seconds remaining',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple countdown timer that counts down from 10 seconds and displays the remaining time in seconds. When the countdown finishes, it prints a message to the console.

With this setup, you can easily customize the countdown duration and the actions that occur when the countdown completes.

# Complete Example of Countdown Flutter NS Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:countdown_flutter_ns/countdown_flutter_ns.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Countdown Timer Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Countdown(
            duration: Duration(seconds: 10), // Set countdown duration to 10 seconds
            onFinish: () {
              // This callback is triggered when the countdown finishes
              print('Countdown finished!'); // Log message to console
            },
            builder: (context, time) {
              // This builder function is called every second with the remaining time
              return Text(
                '${time.inSeconds} seconds remaining', // Display remaining time
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Set text style
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget being built.
// 2. A MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a Countdown widget is instantiated.
// 4. The countdown is set for 10 seconds, and an onFinish callback is defined to print a message when the countdown ends.
// 5. The builder function updates the UI every second, displaying the remaining time in seconds.
// 6. When the countdown reaches zero, the onFinish callback is triggered, and the message is printed to the console.
