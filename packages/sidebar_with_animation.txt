# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Sidebar with Animation Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `sidebar_with_animation` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sidebar_with_animation: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the sidebar with animation.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:sidebar_with_animation/sidebar_with_animation.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the sidebar state.

3. Use the `Sidebar` widget provided by the package to create your animated sidebar.

This will be demonstrated in the complete example section below.

# Complete Example of Sidebar with Animation

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sidebar_with_animation/sidebar_with_animation.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to control the sidebar state
  bool isSidebarOpen = false;

  // Function to toggle the sidebar
  void toggleSidebar() {
    setState(() {
      isSidebarOpen = !isSidebarOpen; // Toggle the sidebar state
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Stack(
          children: [
            // Main content of the app
            Center(
              child: ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: toggleSidebar, // Toggle sidebar on button press
                child: Text('Toggle Sidebar'),
              ),
            ),
            // Sidebar with animation
            Sidebar(
              isOpen: isSidebarOpen, // Control the sidebar open state
              onClose: toggleSidebar, // Close sidebar when tapped outside
              items: [
                SidebarItem(
                  icon: Icons.home,
                  title: 'Home',
                  onTap: () {
                    // Handle Home tap
                    print('Home tapped');
                  },
                ),
                SidebarItem(
                  icon: Icons.settings,
                  title: 'Settings',
                  onTap: () {
                    // Handle Settings tap
                    print('Settings tapped');
                  },
                ),
                SidebarItem(
                  icon: Icons.info,
                  title: 'About',
                  onTap: () {
                    // Handle About tap
                    print('About tapped');
                  },
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the sidebar.
// 3. The toggleSidebar function is defined to change the isSidebarOpen state.
// 4. The build method returns a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing a Stack.
// 5. The Stack has two children: a Center widget with a button to toggle the sidebar and the Sidebar widget itself.
// 6. The Sidebar widget takes the isOpen state and a list of SidebarItem widgets.
// 7. Each SidebarItem has an icon, title, and onTap function to handle user interactions.
// 8. When the button is pressed, the sidebar opens or closes with an animation, providing a smooth user experience.
