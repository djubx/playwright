## Using the Package

### Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s how to implement the `select_searchable_list` in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:select_searchable_list/select_searchable_list.dart';
   ```

2. **Create a Stateful Widget**: This widget will hold the searchable list.

   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
   }

   class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
     String? selectedItem;

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Searchable List Example')),
         body: Center(
           child: SelectSearchableList<String>(
             items: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Elderberry'],
             onChanged: (value) {
               setState(() {
                 selectedItem = value;
               });
             },
             hint: 'Select a fruit',
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Run Your Application**: Use `flutter run` to start your application and see the searchable list in action.

### Customization

You can customize the appearance of the dropdown by using various properties provided by the package, such as `hint`, `itemBuilder`, and `decoration`.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:select_searchable_list/select_searchable_list.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Searchable List Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the selected item
  String? selectedItem;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Searchable List Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: SelectSearchableList<String>(
          // List of items to display
          items: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Elderberry'],
          // Callback function when an item is selected
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              selectedItem = value; // Update the selected item
            });
          },
          hint: 'Select a fruit', // Placeholder text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home screen.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected item.
// 4. In the build method, a SelectSearchableList is created with a list of fruits.
// 5. When a user selects an item, the onChanged callback updates the selectedItem state.
// 6. The selected item can be used for further processing or display as needed.
