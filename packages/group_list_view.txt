# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `group_list_view`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the `group_list_view` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  group_list_view: ^latest_version
```
Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:group_list_view/group_list_view.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package
You can now use the `GroupListView` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it.

# Complete Example of Using `group_list_view`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:group_list_view/group_list_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Group List View Example',
      home: GroupListViewExample(),
    );
  }
}

class GroupListViewExample extends StatelessWidget {
  // Sample data for the grouped list
  final Map<String, List<String>> data = {
    'Fruits': ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange'],
    'Vegetables': ['Carrot', 'Broccoli', 'Spinach'],
    'Dairy': ['Milk', 'Cheese', 'Yogurt'],
  };

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Grouped List View'),
      ),
      body: GroupListView(
        sections: data.keys.toList(), // List of section headers
        itemBuilder: (context, section, index) {
          // Build each item in the group
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(data[section]![index]), // Display item name
          );
        },
        sectionHeaderBuilder: (context, section) {
          // Build the section header
          return Container(
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
            color: Colors.grey[300],
            child: Text(
              section,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
          );
        },
        itemCount: (section) => data[section]!.length, // Number of items in each section
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// The GroupListViewExample widget is the main screen of the app.
// It contains a Map of data categorized into sections: Fruits, Vegetables, and Dairy.
// The GroupListView widget is used to create the grouped list view.
// The sections are extracted from the keys of the data map.
// The itemBuilder function creates ListTile widgets for each item in the group.
// The sectionHeaderBuilder function creates a header for each section with a distinct style.
// The itemCount function returns the number of items in each section.
// This structure allows for a clear and organized display of grouped data.
