# Setting Up the Credits Flutter Package
=====================================

To use the Credits Flutter package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  credits: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:credits/credits.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create a Credits Page

Create a new Dart file and add the following code:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:credits/credits.dart';

class CreditsPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Credits'),
      ),
      body: Credits(
        // Add your credits here
        credits: [
          Credit(
            name: 'Package 1',
            license: 'MIT',
            url: 'https://example.com/package1',
          ),
          Credit(
            name: 'Package 2',
            license: 'Apache 2.0',
            url: 'https://example.com/package2',
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
### Step 4: Add the Credits Page to Your App

Add the credits page to your app's navigation:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'credits_page.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Real Flutter',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Real Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              Navigator.push(
                context,
                MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => CreditsPage()),
              );
            },
            child: Text('View Credits'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
