# Live Icon Flutter Package

The **live_icon** Flutter package is designed to enhance the user experience by providing animated icons that can respond to user interactions or state changes in real-time. This package is particularly useful in applications where dynamic visual feedback is essential, such as in gaming apps, social media platforms, or any app that requires engaging UI elements.

## When to Use This Package
- **Interactive Applications**: When you want to provide users with immediate visual feedback based on their actions.
- **Gaming Apps**: To create engaging and lively icons that react to game events.
- **Social Media**: For notifications or status updates that require attention-grabbing icons.

## Features
- **Customizable Animations**: Easily customize the animation duration, curve, and other properties.
- **State Management**: Integrates well with state management solutions to reflect changes in the UI.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal performance overhead, ensuring smooth animations without lag.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Live Icon

## Installation
To add the **live_icon** package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  live_icon: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your icons require any specific capabilities (like notifications).

## Using the Package
To use the **live_icon** package, you can create a simple widget that utilizes the `LiveIcon` class. Below is a basic example of how to implement it.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:live_icon/live_icon.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isActive = false;

  void _toggleIcon() {
    setState(() {
      _isActive = !_isActive; // Toggle the state
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Live Icon Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: GestureDetector(
          onTap: _toggleIcon, // Change icon state on tap
          child: LiveIcon(
            icon: Icons.favorite,
            isActive: _isActive, // Pass the active state
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300), // Animation duration
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, tapping the icon toggles its active state, which triggers an animation.

# Complete Example of Live Icon

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:live_icon/live_icon.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isActive = false; // State variable to track icon activity

  void _toggleIcon() {
    setState(() {
      _isActive = !_isActive; // Toggle the state when the icon is tapped
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Live Icon Example')), // AppBar with title
      body: Center(
        child: GestureDetector(
          onTap: _toggleIcon, // Detect tap to toggle icon state
          child: LiveIcon(
            icon: Icons.favorite, // Icon to display
            isActive: _isActive, // Pass the active state to LiveIcon
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300), // Set animation duration
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. The _isActive boolean variable is initialized to false, indicating the icon is not active.
// 3. The _toggleIcon method toggles the _isActive state when called.
// 4. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a GestureDetector is used to detect taps on the icon.
// 6. When the icon is tapped, the _toggleIcon method is called, updating the state.
// 7. The LiveIcon widget displays the heart icon, which animates based on the _isActive state.
// 8. The animation duration is set to 300 milliseconds, providing a smooth transition.
