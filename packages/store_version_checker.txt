// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, and the `RealFlutter` widget is created.
// 2. In the `initState` method, the `_checkVersion` function is called to check the current app version and retrieve the latest version number and release notes.
// 3. The `_checkVersion` function creates an instance of the `StoreVersionChecker` class and uses it to get the current app version, latest version number, and release notes.
// 4. The current app version, latest version number, and release notes are displayed on the screen using `Text` widgets.
// 5. If the user wants to check for updates again, they can restart the app or call the `_checkVersion` function manually.
