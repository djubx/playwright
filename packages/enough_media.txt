                      await _mediaFiles[index].delete();
                    },
                  ),
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Flow of the application:
// 1. The user clicks the play button to play a media file.
// 2. The media player plays the media file.
// 3. The user clicks the record button to record a media file.
// 4. The media recorder records the media file.
// 5. The user views the list of media files.
// 6. The user deletes a media file.
```

// Summary: The code flows by first initializing the media player and media recorder. The user can then play, record, and manage media files. The media files are listed in a ListView, and the user can delete a media file by clicking the delete button.
