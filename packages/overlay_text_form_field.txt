# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Overlay Text Form Field

## Installation
To get started with the `overlay_text_form_field` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  overlay_text_form_field: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/overlay_text_form_field).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow for overlays if you are using any specific permissions or features.

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to implement the `OverlayTextFormField` in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:overlay_text_form_field/overlay_text_form_field.dart';
   ```

2. Use the `OverlayTextFormField` widget in your form:
   ```dart
   OverlayTextFormField(
     labelText: 'Enter your name',
     overlayText: 'This will be displayed in the overlay',
     onChanged: (value) {
       // Handle the input value
     },
   )
   ```

This simple setup will create a text field with an overlay that displays additional information when the user interacts with it.

## Best Practices
- **Keep Overlays Concise**: Ensure that the information in the overlay is brief and to the point.
- **Test on Multiple Devices**: Always test the overlay on different screen sizes to ensure it behaves as expected.
- **Use Clear Labels**: Make sure your labels are clear and descriptive to enhance user understanding.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate the `overlay_text_form_field` package into your Flutter application and enhance the user experience.

# Complete Example of Overlay Text Form Field

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:overlay_text_form_field/overlay_text_form_field.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Overlay Text Form Field Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Overlay Text Form Field Demo'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: MyForm(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyFormState createState() => _MyFormState();
}

class _MyFormState extends State<MyForm> {
  final _controller = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        OverlayTextFormField(
          labelText: 'Enter your name',
          overlayText: 'Please enter your full name',
          controller: _controller,
          onChanged: (value) {
            // Handle the input value
            print('Input value: $value');
          },
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Handle form submission
            print('Submitted name: ${_controller.text}');
          },
          child: Text('Submit'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body with padding.
// 4. MyForm is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the form.
// 5. Inside MyForm, an OverlayTextFormField is created with a label and overlay text.
// 6. The onChanged callback prints the current input value to the console.
// 7. An ElevatedButton is provided to submit the form, which prints the entered name.
// 8. The application is structured to provide a clear and interactive user experience.
