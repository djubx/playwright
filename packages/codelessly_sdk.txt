# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Codelessly SDK

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `codelessly_sdk` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `codelessly_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  codelessly_sdk: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

3. Add the necessary permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` if required by your application.

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add any required permissions or configurations specific to your app's needs.

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `codelessly_sdk` package:

```dart
import 'package:codelessly_sdk/codelessly_sdk.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `Codelessly` class to create your UI. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and use the package:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}
```

In the `RealFlutter` class, you can define your UI components and bind data as needed.

# Complete Example of Codelessly SDK in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:codelessly_sdk/codelessly_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Codelessly SDK Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Main entry point for the app
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the Codelessly SDK
  final Codelessly _codelessly = Codelessly();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load the codeless UI configuration
    _codelessly.loadUI();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Codelessly SDK Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display a dynamic widget from Codelessly
            _codelessly.getDynamicWidget(),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Trigger an action to update the UI
                _codelessly.updateUI();
              },
              child: Text('Update UI'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that initializes the Codelessly SDK in its state.
// 4. In the initState method, the UI configuration is loaded from Codelessly.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, a dynamic widget from Codelessly is displayed.
// 7. An ElevatedButton is provided to trigger an update to the UI when pressed.
```
