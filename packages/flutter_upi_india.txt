# Setting Up and Using the Flutter UPI India Package

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_upi_india` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_upi_india: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

2. **Enable UPI Payments**: Ensure that your app is set up to handle UPI intents by adding the following intent filter:

```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW"/>
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"/>
    <data android:scheme="upi"/>
</intent-filter>
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the necessary configurations in your `Info.plist` file to handle UPI payments. You may need to add URL schemes depending on the UPI apps you want to support.

## Using the Package
To initiate a UPI payment, you can use the following code snippet:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_upi_india/flutter_upi_india.dart';

void initiatePayment() async {
  UpiIndia upiIndia = UpiIndia();
  String response = await upiIndia.startTransaction(
    app: UpiIndiaApps.BHIM,
    receiverUpiId: 'example@upi',
    receiverName: 'Receiver Name',
    transactionRefId: 'txn123',
    transactionNote: 'Payment for services',
    amount: 10.0,
  );
  print(response);
}
```

This code initializes a UPI transaction with the specified parameters. The `startTransaction` method returns a response indicating the success or failure of the transaction.

# Complete Example of Using flutter_upi_india

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_upi_india/flutter_upi_india.dart';

  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'UPI Payment Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to initiate UPI payment
  void initiatePayment() async {
    UpiIndia upiIndia = UpiIndia();
    // Start a UPI transaction
    String response = await upiIndia.startTransaction(
      app: UpiIndiaApps.BHIM, // Specify the UPI app to use
      receiverUpiId: 'example@upi', // UPI ID of the receiver
      receiverName: 'Receiver Name', // Name of the receiver
      transactionRefId: 'txn123', // Unique transaction reference ID
      transactionNote: 'Payment for services', // Note for the transaction
      amount: 10.0, // Amount to be paid
    );
    // Print the response from the transaction
    print(response);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('UPI Payment Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: initiatePayment, // Call the payment function on button press
          child: Text('Pay with UPI'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home screen is set to PaymentScreen, where the payment button is displayed.
// 3. When the user taps the "Pay with UPI" button, the initiatePayment function is called.
// 4. This function creates an instance of UpiIndia and calls startTransaction with the required parameters.
// 5. The transaction response is printed to the console, indicating whether the payment was successful or failed.
