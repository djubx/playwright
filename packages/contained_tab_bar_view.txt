# Contained Tab Bar View Flutter Package

The `contained_tab_bar_view` Flutter package is a versatile widget that provides a contained tab bar view, allowing developers to create a tabbed interface within a single screen. This package is particularly useful when you want to display multiple views or pages within a single screen, without navigating away from the current context. It is ideal for applications that require a compact and organized way to present different sections of content, such as dashboards, settings pages, or profile sections.

## Features

- **Contained Tabs**: Unlike the default `TabBar` in Flutter, this package allows the tabs to be contained within a specific area of the screen, providing a more integrated look.
- **Customizable**: Offers extensive customization options for the tab bar and the tab views, including colors, styles, and animations.
- **Easy to Use**: Simplifies the process of creating a tabbed interface with minimal setup and configuration.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

### When to Use

- When you need a tabbed interface within a single screen.
- When you want to maintain a consistent look and feel across different sections of your app.
- When you need a customizable and flexible tab bar solution.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Contained Tab Bar View

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `contained_tab_bar_view` package in a Flutter application. We will cover the installation, configuration, and platform-specific considerations for both Android and iOS.

## Installation

To use the `contained_tab_bar_view` package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  contained_tab_bar_view: ^0.7.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Setup and Configuration

### Android

No specific configuration is required for Android. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 9.0. You can set this in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Using the Package

To use the `contained_tab_bar_view`, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:contained_tab_bar_view/contained_tab_bar_view.dart';
```

You can then use the `ContainedTabBarView` widget within your widget tree. Here is a basic setup:

```dart
ContainedTabBarView(
  tabs: [
    Text('Tab 1'),
    Text('Tab 2'),
    Text('Tab 3'),
  ],
  views: [
    Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 1')),
    Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 2')),
    Center(child: Text('Content for Tab 3')),
  ],
  onChange: (index) => print('Selected Tab: $index'),
)
```

<-- MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:contained_tab_bar_view/contained_tab_bar_view.dart';

void main() => runApp(RealFlutter());

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Contained Tab Bar View Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Contained Tab Bar View'),
      ),
      body: ContainedTabBarView(
        tabs: [
          Text('Home'),
          Text('Profile'),
          Text('Settings'),
        ],
        views: [
          // View for Home tab
          Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Home tab!')),
          // View for Profile tab
          Center(child: Text('This is your Profile tab.')),
          // View for Settings tab
          Center(child: Text('Adjust your Settings here.')),
        ],
        onChange: (index) {
          // Callback when tab changes
          print('Selected Tab: $index');
        },
        tabBarProperties: TabBarProperties(
          indicatorColor: Colors.blue,
          labelColor: Colors.black,
          unselectedLabelColor: Colors.grey,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The RealFlutter app starts with the main function, which runs the app.
// The app uses MaterialApp to set up the basic app structure and theme.
// HomeScreen is the main screen of the app, containing the ContainedTabBarView.
// ContainedTabBarView is used to create a tabbed interface with three tabs: Home, Profile, and Settings.
// Each tab has its own view, which is a simple Center widget with text.
// The onChange callback is used to print the index of the selected tab to the console.
// TabBarProperties are used to customize the appearance of the tab bar, such as indicator color and label colors.
```

In this example, we have created a simple Flutter application using the `contained_tab_bar_view` package. The application consists of a main screen with a tabbed interface containing three tabs: Home, Profile, and Settings. Each tab displays a different message, and the tab bar is customized with specific colors for the indicator and labels. The `onChange` callback is used to print the index of the selected tab to the console, demonstrating how to handle tab changes.

This setup provides a clean and organized way to present different sections of content within a single screen, making it ideal for applications that require a compact and integrated tabbed interface.
