# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Animator Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_animator` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_animator` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_animator: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `flutter_animator` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_animator/flutter_animator.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the animations provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `RealFlutter` class to create an animated button.

```dart
// Example of using flutter_animator in a widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Animator Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Animator(
          duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
          cycles: 0, // Infinite loop
          tween: Tween<double>(begin: 0.0, end: 1.0),
          builder: (context, animatorState, child) => Opacity(
            opacity: animatorState.value,
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {},
              child: Text('Click Me!'),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a button that fades in and out using the `Animator` widget. The `tween` property defines the animation from 0.0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque).

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `flutter_animator` package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of Using the Flutter Animator Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_animator/flutter_animator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Animator Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Animator Example')),
      body: Center(
        // Using the Animator widget to create a fade-in effect
        child: Animator(
          duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Duration of the animation
          cycles: 0, // Infinite loop
          tween: Tween<double>(begin: 0.0, end: 1.0), // Tween for opacity
          builder: (context, animatorState, child) => Opacity(
            opacity: animatorState.value, // Set the opacity based on animation state
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Click Me!'), // Button text
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center, an Animator widget is used to create a fade-in effect for the button.
// 5. The button's opacity is controlled by the animatorState.value, which changes over the duration of the animation.
// 6. When the button is pressed, a SnackBar is displayed to inform the user that the button was pressed.
```
