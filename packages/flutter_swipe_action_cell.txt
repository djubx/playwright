# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_swipe_action_cell

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_swipe_action_cell` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_swipe_action_cell: ^0.6.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_swipe_action_cell/flutter_swipe_action_cell.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup

You can use the `SwipeActionCell` widget to wrap your list items. Here’s how to set it up for both Android and iOS:

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable the `SwipeActionCell` in your `Info.plist` if you encounter any issues. However, in most cases, the default settings should suffice.

## Step 4: Using SwipeActionCell

Here’s a simple example of how to use the `SwipeActionCell` in a list:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_swipe_action_cell/flutter_swipe_action_cell.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Swipe Action Cell Example')),
        body: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 20,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return SwipeActionCell(
              key: ValueKey(index),
              background: Container(
                color: Colors.red,
                child: Align(
                  alignment: Alignment.centerRight,
                  child: Padding(
                    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                    child: Text('Delete', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              child: ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'),
              ),
              onSwipe: (action) {
                if (action == SwipeAction.delete) {
                  // Handle delete action
                  print('Deleted Item $index');
                }
              },
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple list of items that can be swiped to reveal a delete action. The `onSwipe` callback allows you to handle the action when the user swipes.

import 'package:flutter_swipe_action_cell/flutter_swipe_action_cell.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Swipe Action Cell Example')),
        body: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 20, // Number of items in the list
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return SwipeActionCell(
              key: ValueKey(index), // Unique key for each cell
              background: Container(
                color: Colors.red, // Background color for swipe action
                child: Align(
                  alignment: Alignment.centerRight,
                  child: Padding(
                    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                    child: Text('Delete', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)), // Text for delete action
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              child: ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'), // Title of the list item
              ),
              onSwipe: (action) {
                if (action == SwipeAction.delete) {
                  // Handle delete action
                  print('Deleted Item $index'); // Log the deletion
                }
              },
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts by running the `RealFlutter` class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// Inside the `build` method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a ListView.
// The ListView.builder creates a list of 20 items, each wrapped in a `SwipeActionCell`.
// Each cell has a red background that appears when swiped, displaying a "Delete" action.
// The `onSwipe` callback checks if the delete action was triggered and logs the deletion to the console.
// This allows users to swipe left on an item to reveal the delete option, enhancing the interactivity of the list.
