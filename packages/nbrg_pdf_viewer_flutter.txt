# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using nbrg_pdf_viewer_flutter

## Installation
To get started with `nbrg_pdf_viewer_flutter`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  nbrg_pdf_viewer_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/nbrg_pdf_viewer_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are loading PDFs from the internet. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `nbrg_pdf_viewer_flutter` package, you can create a simple Flutter application that loads a PDF file. Below is a basic example of how to implement it.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nbrg_pdf_viewer_flutter/nbrg_pdf_viewer_flutter.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the PDF viewer:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the PDF document
  PDFDocument? document;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load the PDF document from an asset or URL
    loadPDF();
  }

  // Function to load the PDF document
  Future<void> loadPDF() async {
    document = await PDFDocument.fromAsset('assets/sample.pdf');
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Viewer Example'),
      ),
      body: document == null
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator())
          : PDFViewer(document: document!),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, run your app and see the PDF displayed.

# Complete Example of Using nbrg_pdf_viewer_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nbrg_pdf_viewer_flutter/nbrg_pdf_viewer_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PDF Viewer App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the PDF document
  PDFDocument? document;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load the PDF document from an asset or URL
    loadPDF();
  }

  // Function to load the PDF document
  Future<void> loadPDF() async {
    // Load PDF from assets
    document = await PDFDocument.fromAsset('assets/sample.pdf');
    // Update the state to reflect the loaded document
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Viewer Example'),
      ),
      body: document == null
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator while PDF is loading
          : PDFViewer(document: document!), // Display the PDF document
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. In the initState method, the loadPDF function is called to load the PDF document.
// 4. The loadPDF function uses the PDFDocument class to load a PDF from the assets.
// 5. Once the PDF is loaded, setState is called to update the UI.
// 6. In the build method, if the document is null, a CircularProgressIndicator is shown.
// 7. Once the document is loaded, the PDFViewer widget displays the PDF content.
