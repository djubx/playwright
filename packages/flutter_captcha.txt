# Setup and Usage of flutter_captcha

## Installation
To add the `flutter_captcha` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_captcha: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_captcha).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_captcha` package, you will need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_captcha/flutter_captcha.dart';
```

You can then create a CAPTCHA widget in your application as follows:

```dart
Captcha(
  onVerified: (String response) {
    // Handle successful verification
  },
  onError: (String error) {
    // Handle error
  },
)
```

This widget will display the CAPTCHA and handle the verification process.

# Complete Example of flutter_captcha

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_captcha/flutter_captcha.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter CAPTCHA Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('CAPTCHA Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CaptchaWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CaptchaWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CaptchaWidgetState createState() => _CaptchaWidgetState();
}

class _CaptchaWidgetState extends State<CaptchaWidget> {
  String _captchaResponse = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the CAPTCHA widget
        Captcha(
          onVerified: (String response) {
            // Store the response when verification is successful
            setState(() {
              _captchaResponse = response;
            });
          },
          onError: (String error) {
            // Handle error during CAPTCHA verification
            print('CAPTCHA Error: $error');
          },
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        // Display the CAPTCHA response
        Text(_captchaResponse.isNotEmpty ? 'CAPTCHA Verified: $_captchaResponse' : 'Please complete the CAPTCHA'),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered CaptchaWidget.
// 3. CaptchaWidget is a stateful widget that manages the CAPTCHA verification process.
// 4. When the Captcha widget is displayed, it waits for user interaction.
// 5. Upon successful verification, the onVerified callback is triggered, updating the state with the CAPTCHA response.
// 6. The response is displayed below the CAPTCHA widget, indicating whether the verification was successful or not.
