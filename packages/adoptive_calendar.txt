# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the adoptive_calendar Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `adoptive_calendar` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  adoptive_calendar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your calendar requires access to user data. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your calendar.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `adoptive_calendar` in your app.

# Complete Example of Using adoptive_calendar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adoptive_calendar/adoptive_calendar.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Adoptive Calendar Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CalendarHome(), // Set the home widget
    );
  }
}

class CalendarHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CalendarHomeState createState() => _CalendarHomeState();
}

class _CalendarHomeState extends State<CalendarHome> {
  DateTime? selectedDate; // Variable to hold the selected date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Adoptive Calendar Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the selected date
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Text(
              selectedDate != null
                  ? 'Selected Date: ${selectedDate!.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0]
                  : 'No Date Selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ),
          // Adoptive Calendar widget
          Expanded(
            child: AdoptiveCalendar(
              onDateSelected: (date) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedDate = date; // Update the selected date
                });
              },
              // Additional customization options can be added here
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the adoptive_calendar package.
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The CalendarHome widget is the main screen that displays the calendar.
// 4. A stateful widget is used to manage the selected date.
// 5. The selected date is displayed at the top of the screen.
// 6. The AdoptiveCalendar widget is included, which allows users to select a date.
// 7. When a date is selected, the onDateSelected callback updates the selectedDate variable, triggering a rebuild to display the new date.

// In summary, this application allows users to select a date from the calendar, which is then displayed on the screen. The use of state management ensures that the UI updates in response to user interactions.
