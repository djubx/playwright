# Vaultify Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with Vaultify, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  vaultify: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Basic Usage
To use Vaultify in your Flutter application, you can follow these steps:

1. **Import the Package**:
   ```dart
   import 'package:vaultify/vaultify.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize Vaultify**:
   ```dart
   void main() async {
       WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
       await Vaultify.init();
       runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```

3. **Store Data**:
   ```dart
   await Vaultify.store('key', 'value');
   ```

4. **Retrieve Data**:
   ```dart
   String? value = await Vaultify.retrieve('key');
   ```

5. **Delete Data**:
   ```dart
   await Vaultify.delete('key');
   ```

With these steps, you can easily integrate Vaultify into your Flutter application for secure data management.

# Complete Example of Using Vaultify in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vaultify/vaultify.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure Flutter binding is initialized before using Vaultify
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize Vaultify for secure storage
  await Vaultify.init();
  
  // Run the main application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Vaultify Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _storedValue = 'No value stored';

  // Method to store data securely
  void _storeData() async {
    await Vaultify.store('myKey', 'Hello Vaultify!');
    setState(() {
      _storedValue = 'Data stored successfully!';
    });
  }

  // Method to retrieve data securely
  void _retrieveData() async {
    String? value = await Vaultify.retrieve('myKey');
    setState(() {
      _storedValue = value ?? 'No value found';
    });
  }

  // Method to delete data securely
  void _deleteData() async {
    await Vaultify.delete('myKey');
    setState(() {
      _storedValue = 'Data deleted successfully!';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Vaultify Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_storedValue), // Display the stored value
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _storeData, // Store data button
              child: Text('Store Data'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _retrieveData, // Retrieve data button
              child: Text('Retrieve Data'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _deleteData, // Delete data button
              child: Text('Delete Data'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing Vaultify for secure storage.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is the root of the application, setting up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, which contains buttons to store, retrieve, and delete data.
// 4. When the "Store Data" button is pressed, the _storeData method is called, storing a value securely.
// 5. The "Retrieve Data" button calls the _retrieveData method, which fetches the stored value and updates the UI.
// 6. The "Delete Data" button calls the _deleteData method, removing the stored value and updating the UI accordingly.
