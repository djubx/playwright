# Numeral System Flutter Package

The **numeral_system** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the conversion and formatting of numbers across various numeral systems. This package is particularly useful for applications that require numerical representation in different formats, such as binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the **numeral_system** package in scenarios such as:
- Developing educational apps that teach number systems.
- Creating games that require number conversions.
- Building applications that need to display numbers in various formats for user preferences.

## Features
- **Conversion**: Easily convert numbers between different numeral systems.
- **Formatting**: Format numbers for display in various styles.
- **Customizable**: Options to customize the output format based on user needs.

With these features, the **numeral_system** package simplifies the process of handling numbers in different formats, making it an essential tool for Flutter developers.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Numeral System Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **numeral_system** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  numeral_system: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart files, import the package to start using it:

```dart
import 'package:numeral_system/numeral_system.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the package to convert and format numbers. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create an instance of the RealFlutter class
  RealFlutter numeralConverter = RealFlutter();

  // Convert decimal to binary
  String binary = numeralConverter.convertDecimalToBinary(10);
  print('Decimal 10 in Binary: $binary'); // Output: 1010

  // Convert decimal to hexadecimal
  String hex = numeralConverter.convertDecimalToHexadecimal(255);
  print('Decimal 255 in Hexadecimal: $hex'); // Output: FF
}
```

This example demonstrates how to convert decimal numbers to binary and hexadecimal formats using the **numeral_system** package.

# Complete Example of Using the Numeral System Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:numeral_system/numeral_system.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// MyApp is the main widget of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Numeral System Example',
      home: NumeralHome(),
    );
  }
}

// NumeralHome is the home screen of the application
class NumeralHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an instance of the RealFlutter class
    RealFlutter numeralConverter = RealFlutter();

    // Example numbers for conversion
    int decimalNumber = 42;

    // Convert decimal to binary and hexadecimal
    String binary = numeralConverter.convertDecimalToBinary(decimalNumber);
    String hexadecimal = numeralConverter.convertDecimalToHexadecimal(decimalNumber);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Numeral System Converter'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Decimal: $decimalNumber'),
            Text('Binary: $binary'),
            Text('Hexadecimal: $hexadecimal'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. NumeralHome is displayed as the home screen.
// 4. Inside NumeralHome, an instance of RealFlutter is created.
// 5. A decimal number (42) is defined for conversion.
// 6. The decimal number is converted to binary and hexadecimal formats.
// 7. The results are displayed in the center of the screen using Text widgets.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this complete example, we have created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the **numeral_system** package. The application converts a decimal number (42) into its binary and hexadecimal representations and displays the results on the screen.

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
- `MyApp` sets up the main structure of the app, including the title and home screen.
- The `NumeralHome` widget is responsible for the core functionality, where it creates an instance of `RealFlutter` to perform number conversions.
- The converted values are displayed in a user-friendly format, showcasing the package's capabilities.

This structured approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the **numeral_system** package, from its description and setup to a complete working example.
