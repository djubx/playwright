# Exploring the "tree_list" Flutter Package

The `tree_list` package is a powerful Flutter library designed to create tree-like structures in your applications. This package is particularly useful for displaying hierarchical data, such as file systems, organizational charts, or any nested data structure. With `tree_list`, developers can easily implement expandable and collapsible lists, enhancing the user experience by allowing users to navigate complex data intuitively.

## Key Features
- **Hierarchical Data Representation**: Easily display nested data structures.
- **Expandable and Collapsible Nodes**: Users can expand or collapse nodes to view or hide child items.
- **Customizable UI**: Offers flexibility in styling and layout to match your app's design.
- **Efficient Performance**: Optimized for performance, even with large datasets.

## When to Use
Consider using the `tree_list` package when you need to:
- Display a file explorer-like interface.
- Create a nested menu or settings structure.
- Show organizational hierarchies or category trees.

Overall, `tree_list` is an excellent choice for any Flutter application that requires a clear and interactive way to present hierarchical data.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "tree_list" Package

## Installation
To get started with the `tree_list` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tree_list: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/tree_list). After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `tree_list` package, you need to create a data model that represents your tree structure. Here’s a simple example of how to implement a tree list in your Flutter application:

1. Create a data model for your tree nodes.
2. Use the `TreeListView` widget to display your data.

Here’s a basic implementation:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tree_list/tree_list.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for the tree structure
    final List<TreeNode<String>> nodes = [
      TreeNode<String>(value: 'Root', children: [
        TreeNode<String>(value: 'Child 1', children: [
          TreeNode<String>(value: 'Grandchild 1'),
          TreeNode<String>(value: 'Grandchild 2'),
        ]),
        TreeNode<String>(value: 'Child 2'),
      ]),
    ];

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Tree List Example')),
      body: TreeListView<String>(
        nodes: nodes,
        itemBuilder: (context, node) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(node.value),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple tree structure with a root node and two child nodes, each with their own children. The `TreeListView` widget is used to render the tree, and the `itemBuilder` is responsible for creating the UI for each node.

# Complete Example of the "tree_list" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tree_list/tree_list.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for the tree structure
    final List<TreeNode<String>> nodes = [
      TreeNode<String>(value: 'Root', children: [
        TreeNode<String>(value: 'Child 1', children: [
          TreeNode<String>(value: 'Grandchild 1'),
          TreeNode<String>(value: 'Grandchild 2'),
        ]),
        TreeNode<String>(value: 'Child 2'),
      ]),
    ];

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Tree List Example')),
      body: TreeListView<String>(
        nodes: nodes,
        itemBuilder: (context, node) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(node.value), // Display the node value
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(), // Start the app with the RealFlutter widget
  ));
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and sets the home widget to RealFlutter.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a TreeListView.
// 3. The TreeListView is populated with a list of TreeNode objects representing the hierarchical data.
// 4. Each node is displayed using a ListTile, which shows the value of the node.
// 5. Users can expand or collapse nodes to navigate through the tree structure.
