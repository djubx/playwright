# Exploring the Cosmos Flutter Package

The **Cosmos** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed for developers looking to integrate advanced state management and data handling capabilities into their Flutter applications. It provides a seamless way to manage application state, making it easier to build responsive and dynamic user interfaces.

## When to Use Cosmos
You might consider using the Cosmos package in scenarios such as:
- Building applications that require complex state management.
- Creating responsive UIs that need to react to changes in data.
- Developing applications that involve real-time data updates, such as chat applications or live dashboards.

## Key Features
- **Reactive State Management**: Automatically updates the UI when the underlying data changes.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate with existing Flutter applications.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Designed to minimize unnecessary rebuilds, enhancing performance.
- **Support for Multiple Data Sources**: Can handle data from various sources, including APIs and local databases.

With these features, Cosmos stands out as a robust choice for Flutter developers looking to enhance their applications' interactivity and responsiveness.

# Setting Up and Using the Cosmos Package

## Installation
To get started with the Cosmos package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  cosmos: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/cosmos).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a basic state management scenario using Cosmos.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:cosmos/cosmos.dart';
```

2. Create a state class that extends `CosmosState`:

```dart
class MyState extends CosmosState {
  int counter = 0;

  void increment() {
    counter++;
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners to rebuild the UI
  }
}
```

3. Use the state in your widget:

```dart
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final state = Cosmos.of<MyState>(context);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cosmos Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Counter: ${state.counter}'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: state.increment,
              child: Text('Increment'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

With these steps, you can effectively manage state in your Flutter application using the Cosmos package.

# Complete Example of Cosmos in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cosmos/cosmos.dart';

// Define the main function to run the app
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Create a StatefulWidget that uses Cosmos for state management
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CosmosProvider<MyState>(
      // Provide the state to the widget tree
      create: (context) => MyState(),
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Cosmos Example',
        home: MyHomePage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Define the state class that extends CosmosState
class MyState extends CosmosState {
  int counter = 0; // Initialize the counter

  // Method to increment the counter
  void increment() {
    counter++;
    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners to rebuild the UI
  }
}

// Create the main home page widget
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final state = Cosmos.of<MyState>(context); // Access the state

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Cosmos Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Counter: ${state.counter}'), // Display the counter
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: state.increment, // Increment the counter on button press
              child: Text('Increment'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp uses CosmosProvider to create an instance of MyState and provide it to the widget tree.
// 3. MyHomePage is built, which accesses the state using Cosmos.of<MyState>(context).
// 4. The current value of the counter is displayed in a Text widget.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the increment method is called, which updates the counter and calls notifyListeners().
// 6. This triggers a rebuild of the UI, reflecting the updated counter value.
```
