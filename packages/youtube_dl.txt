# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using youtube_dl

## Installation
To get started with the `youtube_dl` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  youtube_dl: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/youtube_dl).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save downloaded videos.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio downloads.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `youtube_dl` package, you can create a simple function to download a video. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:youtube_dl/youtube_dl.dart';

Future<void> downloadVideo(String url) async {
  var video = await YoutubeDl.download(url);
  print('Video downloaded: ${video.title}');
}
```

This function takes a video URL as input and downloads the video, printing the title upon completion.

With this setup, you are ready to start using the `youtube_dl` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using youtube_dl in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:youtube_dl/youtube_dl.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'YouTube Downloader',
      home: DownloadPage(),
    );
  }
}

class DownloadPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DownloadPageState createState() => _DownloadPageState();
}

class _DownloadPageState extends State<DownloadPage> {
  String _url = '';
  String _status = '';

  // Function to handle video download
  Future<void> _downloadVideo() async {
    setState(() {
      _status = 'Downloading...';
    });

    try {
      // Initiating the download process
      var video = await YoutubeDl.download(_url);
      setState(() {
        _status = 'Downloaded: ${video.title}';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _status = 'Error: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('YouTube Downloader'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter YouTube URL'),
              onChanged: (value) {
                _url = value; // Update the URL as the user types
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _downloadVideo, // Trigger the download on button press
              child: Text('Download Video'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_status), // Display the download status
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (DownloadPage).
// 3. DownloadPage contains a TextField for the user to input a YouTube URL.
// 4. When the user presses the "Download Video" button, the _downloadVideo function is called.
// 5. The _downloadVideo function updates the status to "Downloading..." and attempts to download the video.
// 6. If successful, it updates the status with the downloaded video's title; if an error occurs, it displays the error message.
```
