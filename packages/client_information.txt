# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Client Information Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `client_information` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  client_information: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for better experience.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library for better experience.</string>
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:client_information/client_information.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `client_information` package to retrieve client details. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
void getClientInfo() async {
  var clientInfo = await ClientInformation.getClientInfo();
  print('Device Model: ${clientInfo.deviceModel}');
  print('OS Version: ${clientInfo.osVersion}');
}
```

This function retrieves the client information and prints the device model and OS version to the console.

With these steps, you are now ready to utilize the `client_information` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the Client Information Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:client_information/client_information.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Client Information Example',
      home: ClientInfoScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ClientInfoScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ClientInfoScreenState createState() => _ClientInfoScreenState();
}

class _ClientInfoScreenState extends State<ClientInfoScreen> {
  String _deviceModel = 'Unknown';
  String _osVersion = 'Unknown';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getClientInfo(); // Call the method to get client information
  }

  // Method to retrieve client information
  void _getClientInfo() async {
    var clientInfo = await ClientInformation.getClientInfo();
    setState(() {
      _deviceModel = clientInfo.deviceModel; // Update device model
      _osVersion = clientInfo.osVersion; // Update OS version
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Client Information'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Device Model: $_deviceModel'), // Display device model
            Text('OS Version: $_osVersion'), // Display OS version
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with RealFlutterApp.
// 2. RealFlutterApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (ClientInfoScreen).
// 3. ClientInfoScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages its state.
// 4. In the initState() method, _getClientInfo() is called to fetch client information.
// 5. _getClientInfo() uses the ClientInformation package to retrieve device details asynchronously.
// 6. Once the data is fetched, setState() is called to update the UI with the device model and OS version.
// 7. The build method displays the device information in the center of the screen.
