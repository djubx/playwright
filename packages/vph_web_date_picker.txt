### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `VphWebDatePicker` in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vph_web_date_picker/vph_web_date_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Date Picker Example',
      home: DatePickerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class DatePickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DatePickerDemoState createState() => _DatePickerDemoState();
}

class _DatePickerDemoState extends State<DatePickerDemo> {
  DateTime? selectedDate;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Date Picker Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(

            Text(
              selectedDate == null
                  ? 'No date selected!'
                  : 'Selected date: ${selectedDate!.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0],
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            VphWebDatePicker(
              onDateSelected: (date) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedDate = date;
                });
              },

# Complete Example of vph_web_date_picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Importing Flutter material package for UI components
import 'package:vph_web_date_picker/vph_web_date_picker.dart'; // Importing the vph_web_date_picker package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Entry point of the application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Date Picker Example', // Title of the application
      home: DatePickerDemo(), // Setting the home widget to DatePickerDemo
    );
  }
}

class DatePickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DatePickerDemoState createState() => _DatePickerDemoState(); // Creating the state for DatePickerDemo
}

class _DatePickerDemoState extends State<DatePickerDemo> {
  DateTime? selectedDate; // Variable to hold the selected date

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Date Picker Demo'), // AppBar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Centering the column
          children: [
            Text(
              selectedDate == null
                  ? 'No date selected!' // Message when no date is selected
                  : 'Selected date: ${selectedDate!.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0], // Displaying the selected date
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between text and date picker
            VphWebDatePicker(
              onDateSelected: (date) { // Callback when a date is selected
                setState(() {
                  selectedDate = date; // Updating the selected date
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets DatePickerDemo as the home widget.
// 3. DatePickerDemo is a stateful widget that maintains the selected date.
// 4. The build method of _DatePickerDemoState creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered column.
// 5. The column contains a Text widget that displays the selected date or a message if no date is selected.
// 6. The VphWebDatePicker widget is included, which calls onDateSelected when a date is picked.
// 7. When a date is selected, the state is updated, and the UI reflects the new selected date.
```
