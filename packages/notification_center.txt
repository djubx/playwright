# Notification Center Flutter Package

The `notification_center` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the management of notifications within your Flutter applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to send and receive notifications across different parts of your app, making it easier to implement features like event handling, state management, and user notifications.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `notification_center` package in scenarios such as:

- **Event Broadcasting**: When you need to notify multiple parts of your application about a specific event (e.g., user login, data updates).
- **Decoupled Communication**: When you want to reduce dependencies between components, allowing them to communicate without direct references.
- **State Management**: When you need to manage the state of your application and notify listeners about changes.

## Features

- **Simple API**: The package provides an easy-to-use API for sending and receiving notifications.
- **Event Filtering**: You can filter notifications based on specific criteria, allowing for more granular control over event handling.
- **Support for Multiple Listeners**: Multiple listeners can subscribe to the same notification, making it easy to implement event-driven architectures.

Overall, the `notification_center` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement a robust notification system in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Notification Center Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `notification_center` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  notification_center: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:notification_center/notification_center.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

### Sending Notifications

You can send notifications using the `NotificationCenter` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
NotificationCenter().postNotification(
  notificationName: 'userLoggedIn',
  argument: {'userId': 123},
);
```

### Listening for Notifications

To listen for notifications, you can use the `addObserver` method:

```dart
NotificationCenter().addObserver(
  'userLoggedIn',
  (arg) {
    print('User logged in with ID: ${arg['userId']}');
  },
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` is properly configured. You typically do not need any special permissions for this package, but make sure your app is set up to handle notifications if you plan to extend functionality.

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your app to handle background notifications if you plan to use them. This involves setting up capabilities in Xcode and ensuring your app can handle notifications when in the background.

## Step 4: Optimizations

- **Performance**: If your app has a large number of notifications, consider implementing a mechanism to remove observers that are no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.
- **Error Handling**: Always implement error handling when posting notifications to ensure that your app can gracefully handle any issues.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `notification_center` package effectively in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using the Notification Center Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:notification_center/notification_center.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Notification Center Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _message = 'No notifications yet';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Adding an observer for the 'userLoggedIn' notification
    NotificationCenter().addObserver('userLoggedIn', (arg) {
      // Update the message when the notification is received
      setState(() {
        _message = 'User logged in with ID: ${arg['userId']}';
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Remove the observer when the widget is disposed
    NotificationCenter().removeObserver('userLoggedIn');
    super.dispose();
  }

  void _simulateLogin() {
    // Simulate a user login and post a notification
    NotificationCenter().postNotification(
      notificationName: 'userLoggedIn',
      argument: {'userId': 123},
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Notification Center Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_message), // Display the current message
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _simulateLogin, // Simulate login on button press
              child: Text('Simulate User Login'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutterApp`.
// 2. The `RealFlutterApp` builds a MaterialApp with a `HomeScreen` as its home.
// 3. In the `HomeScreen`, an observer is added in `initState` to listen for 'userLoggedIn' notifications.
// 4. When the 'Simulate User Login' button is pressed, a notification is posted with a user ID.
// 5. The observer receives the notification, updates the state, and the UI reflects the new message.
// 6. When the `HomeScreen` is disposed, the observer is removed to prevent memory leaks.
