# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Disable Screenshots Package

## Installation
To use the `disable_screenshots` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  disable_screenshots: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permission inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key-value pair to request permission for screen recording:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for screen recording prevention.</string>
```

## Usage
To use the package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:disable_screenshots/disable_screenshots.dart';
```

Then, you can disable screenshots and screen recording by calling:

```dart
DisableScreenshots.disable();
```

To re-enable screenshots, you can call:

```dart
DisableScreenshots.enable();
```

### Example Usage
You can call these methods in your app's lifecycle methods, such as `initState` or `dispose`, to manage the screenshot functionality effectively.

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  DisableScreenshots.disable(); // Disable screenshots when the app starts
}

@override
void dispose() {
  DisableScreenshots.enable(); // Re-enable screenshots when the app is disposed
  super.dispose();
}
```

# Complete Example of Using Disable Screenshots

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:disable_screenshots/disable_screenshots.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Disable screenshots when the app starts
    DisableScreenshots.disable();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Re-enable screenshots when the app is disposed
    DisableScreenshots.enable();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Disable Screenshots Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Disable Screenshots Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Screenshots are disabled in this app.',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by running the main function, which initializes the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget's state (_RealFlutterState), the initState method is called.
// 3. Inside initState, the DisableScreenshots.disable() method is invoked to prevent screenshots.
// 4. The build method constructs the UI, displaying a simple message indicating that screenshots are disabled.
// 5. When the app is closed or navigated away from, the dispose method is called.
// 6. In dispose, the DisableScreenshots.enable() method is called to re-enable screenshot functionality, ensuring that the restriction is only active while the app is in use.
