# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Gallery Picker

## Step 1: Adding Dependency

To get started, add the `gallery_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gallery_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the current version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission to access the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save images to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Gallery Picker

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the gallery picker.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gallery_picker/gallery_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gallery Picker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: GalleryPickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class GalleryPickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _GalleryPickerScreenState createState() => _GalleryPickerScreenState();
}

class _GalleryPickerScreenState extends State<GalleryPickerScreen> {
  List<Media>? _selectedMedia; // Variable to hold selected media

  // Function to open the gallery picker
  void _openGallery() async {
    // Open the gallery and allow multiple selections
    final List<Media>? pickedMedia = await GalleryPicker.pickMedia(
      context: context,
      allowMultiple: true,
    );

    // Update the state with the selected media
    setState(() {
      _selectedMedia = pickedMedia;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Gallery Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _openGallery, // Open gallery on button press
              child: Text('Pick Media'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display selected media
            _selectedMedia != null
                ? Wrap(
                    spacing: 8.0,
                    children: _selectedMedia!.map((media) {
                      return media.isVideo
                          ? Icon(Icons.videocam) // Show video icon for videos
                          : Image.file(media.file!); // Display selected image
                    }).toList(),
                  )
                : Text('No media selected'), // Message when no media is selected
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the gallery_picker package.
// The main function initializes the app and sets the home screen to GalleryPickerScreen.
// In the GalleryPickerScreen, we define a button that, when pressed, opens the gallery for media selection.
// The selected media is stored in the _selectedMedia variable and displayed on the screen.
// If the user selects images, they will be shown in a wrap layout, and if videos are selected, a video icon will be displayed.
// The app provides a user-friendly interface for selecting and displaying media from the device's gallery.
