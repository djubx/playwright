# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Rounded Expansion Tile Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `rounded_expansion_tile` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rounded_expansion_tile: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Rounded Expansion Tile

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `RoundedExpansionTile`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rounded_expansion_tile/rounded_expansion_tile.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rounded Expansion Tile Example'),
        ),
        body: ListView(
          children: [
            RoundedExpansionTile(
              title: Text('Section 1'),
              children: [
                ListTile(title: Text('Item 1')),
                ListTile(title: Text('Item 2')),
              ],
            ),
            RoundedExpansionTile(
              title: Text('Section 2'),
              children: [
                ListTile(title: Text('Item 3')),
                ListTile(title: Text('Item 4')),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with two expandable sections. Each section can be expanded to reveal additional items.

# Complete Example of Rounded Expansion Tile

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rounded_expansion_tile/rounded_expansion_tile.dart';

// Main class for the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rounded Expansion Tile Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: ListView(
          children: [
            // First rounded expansion tile
            RoundedExpansionTile(
              title: Text('Section 1'), // Title of the first section
              children: [
                ListTile(title: Text('Item 1')), // First item in section 1
                ListTile(title: Text('Item 2')), // Second item in section 1
              ],
            ),
            // Second rounded expansion tile
            RoundedExpansionTile(
              title: Text('Section 2'), // Title of the second section
              children: [
                ListTile(title: Text('Item 3')), // First item in section 2
                ListTile(title: Text('Item 4')), // Second item in section 2
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a ListView.
3. The ListView contains two RoundedExpansionTile widgets, each representing a section.
4. Each RoundedExpansionTile has a title and a list of ListTile widgets as children.
5. When a user taps on a section title, the section expands to show the items, providing a clean and organized way to display information.
6. The rounded corners of the tiles enhance the visual appeal, making the app look modern and user-friendly.
