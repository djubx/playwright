import 'package:paylink_payment/paylink_payment.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Payment Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Initialize the payment process
              PaylinkPayment.startPayment(
                amount: 100.0, // Amount to be charged
                currency: 'USD', // Currency type
                onSuccess: (response) {
                  // Handle successful payment
                  print('Payment Successful: $response');
                },
                onError: (error) {
                  // Handle payment error
                  print('Payment Error: $error');
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application with a button that initiates a payment when pressed. The `PaylinkPayment.startPayment` method is called with the necessary parameters, and success/error callbacks are provided to handle the payment response.
