# json_dynamic_widget Flutter Package

The `json_dynamic_widget` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for the dynamic creation of widgets from JSON data. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where the UI needs to be flexible and adaptable, such as in applications that require user-generated content or configurations that can change at runtime.

## When to Use This Package

- **Dynamic UI Generation**: When you need to create a UI that can change based on user input or external data sources.
- **Configuration-Based UIs**: For applications that require different layouts or components based on user roles or preferences.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: When you want to quickly iterate on UI designs without hardcoding every widget.

## Features

- **Dynamic Widget Creation**: Convert JSON data into Flutter widgets seamlessly.
- **Customizable**: Supports custom widgets and properties, allowing developers to extend functionality.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

The `json_dynamic_widget` package empowers developers to create highly dynamic and responsive applications, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using json_dynamic_widget

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `json_dynamic_widget` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  json_dynamic_widget: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/json_dynamic_widget).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `json_dynamic_widget`, you will typically follow these steps:

1. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package.
   ```dart
   import 'package:json_dynamic_widget/json_dynamic_widget.dart';
   ```

2. **Create JSON Data**: Define your JSON structure that describes the widgets you want to create dynamically. For example:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "Column",
     "children": [
       {
         "type": "Text",
         "data": "Hello, World!",
         "style": {
           "fontSize": 24,
           "color": "blue"
         }
       },
       {
         "type": "RaisedButton",
         "child": {
           "type": "Text",
           "data": "Click Me"
         },
         "onPressed": "handleClick"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Build the Widget**: Use the `JsonWidgetBuilder` to convert the JSON into a Flutter widget.
   ```dart
   JsonWidgetData jsonWidgetData = JsonWidgetData.fromJson(jsonData);
   Widget myWidget = JsonWidgetBuilder.build(jsonWidgetData);
   ```

4. **Handle Events**: Define any event handlers in your Flutter application to respond to user interactions.

By following these steps, you can effectively utilize the `json_dynamic_widget` package to create dynamic and responsive UIs in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of json_dynamic_widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:json_dynamic_widget/json_dynamic_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define the JSON structure for the dynamic widget
    String jsonData = '''
    {
      "type": "Column",
      "children": [
        {
          "type": "Text",
          "data": "Hello, World!",
          "style": {
            "fontSize": 24,
            "color": "blue"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "RaisedButton",
          "child": {
            "type": "Text",
            "data": "Click Me"
          },
          "onPressed": "handleClick"
        }
      ]
    }
    ''';

    // Convert the JSON string to a JsonWidgetData object
    JsonWidgetData jsonWidgetData = JsonWidgetData.fromJson(jsonDecode(jsonData));

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dynamic Widget Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Build the widget from the JSON data
          child: JsonWidgetBuilder.build(jsonWidgetData),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Event handler for button click
  void handleClick() {
    // Handle button click event
    print("Button clicked!");
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the UI, starting with a MaterialApp and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, a Column widget is created dynamically from the JSON data.
// 4. The JSON data defines a Text widget and a RaisedButton widget.
// 5. When the button is clicked, the handleClick method is invoked, printing a message to the console.
```
