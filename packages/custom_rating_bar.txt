# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Custom Rating Bar

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `custom_rating_bar` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  custom_rating_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:custom_rating_bar/custom_rating_bar.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Rating Bar
You can now use the `CustomRatingBar` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it in a Flutter app.

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

### Example Usage
You can create a simple rating bar as follows:

```dart
CustomRatingBar(
  onRatingChanged: (rating) {
    print("Rating: $rating");
  },
  filledIcon: Icons.star,
  emptyIcon: Icons.star_border,
  isHalfAllowed: true,
  starSize: 40.0,
  rating: 3.5,
),
```

This code snippet creates a rating bar with half-star support, allowing users to select ratings between whole numbers.

## Step 5: Customizing the Rating Bar
You can customize the appearance of the rating bar by changing the `filledIcon`, `emptyIcon`, `starSize`, and other properties to fit your app's design.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `custom_rating_bar` package into your Flutter application and customize it to meet your needs.

# Complete Example of Custom Rating Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_rating_bar/custom_rating_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom Rating Bar Example',
      home: RatingPage(),
    );
  }
}

class RatingPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RatingPageState createState() => _RatingPageState();
}

class _RatingPageState extends State<RatingPage> {
  double _rating = 0.0; // Variable to hold the current rating

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Custom Rating Bar Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the current rating
            Text(
              'Your Rating: $_rating',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space
            // CustomRatingBar widget
            CustomRatingBar(
              onRatingChanged: (rating) {
                setState(() {
                  _rating = rating; // Update the rating state
                });
              },
              filledIcon: Icons.star, // Icon for filled stars
              emptyIcon: Icons.star_border, // Icon for empty stars
              isHalfAllowed: true, // Allow half ratings
              starSize: 40.0, // Size of the stars
              rating: _rating, // Current rating
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to RatingPage.
// 3. RatingPage is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current rating state.
// 4. The _RatingPageState class builds the UI, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column displays the current rating and the CustomRatingBar.
// 6. When a user interacts with the CustomRatingBar, the onRatingChanged callback updates the _rating variable.
// 7. The UI is rebuilt to reflect the new rating, providing immediate feedback to the user.
