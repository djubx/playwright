# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Onboarding Animation Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `onboarding_animation` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  onboarding_animation: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the onboarding animation.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:onboarding_animation/onboarding_animation.dart';
```

2. Create a new widget that uses the `OnboardingAnimation` class:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return OnboardingAnimation(
      pages: [
        OnboardingPage(
          title: 'Welcome to Our App',
          description: 'Discover amazing features and functionalities.',
          image: 'assets/images/welcome.png',
        ),
        OnboardingPage(
          title: 'Stay Connected',
          description: 'Connect with friends and family easily.',
          image: 'assets/images/connect.png',
        ),
        OnboardingPage(
          title: 'Get Started',
          description: 'Let’s get you started on your journey.',
          image: 'assets/images/get_started.png',
        ),
      ],
      onFinish: () {
        // Navigate to the main application screen
        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
          MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => MainScreen()),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, set `RealFlutter` as the home widget in your `main.dart` file.

That's it! You have successfully set up the `onboarding_animation` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Onboarding Animation Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:onboarding_animation/onboarding_animation.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Onboarding Animation Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set the onboarding animation as the home widget
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return OnboardingAnimation(
      pages: [
        OnboardingPage(
          title: 'Welcome to Our App',
          description: 'Discover amazing features and functionalities.',
          image: 'assets/images/welcome.png', // Image for the first page
        ),
        OnboardingPage(
          title: 'Stay Connected',
          description: 'Connect with friends and family easily.',
          image: 'assets/images/connect.png', // Image for the second page
        ),
        OnboardingPage(
          title: 'Get Started',
          description: 'Let’s get you started on your journey.',
          image: 'assets/images/get_started.png', // Image for the third page
        ),
      ],
      onFinish: () {
        // Navigate to the main application screen when onboarding is finished
        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
          MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => MainScreen()),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

class MainScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Main Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the main application!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home widget is set to RealFlutter, which contains the onboarding animation.
// 3. The OnboardingAnimation widget takes a list of OnboardingPage widgets.
// 4. Each OnboardingPage has a title, description, and image.
// 5. When the user finishes the onboarding process, the onFinish callback is triggered.
// 6. This callback navigates the user to the MainScreen, which is the main part of the application.
