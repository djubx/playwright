Here's a detailed technical blog on the `redux_logging` Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Redux Logging Flutter Package

The `redux_logging` package is a middleware for the Redux state management library in Flutter that provides logging capabilities for Redux actions and state changes. It is particularly useful for debugging and monitoring the state of your application during development. By logging actions and state transitions, developers can gain insights into how their application behaves, making it easier to identify issues and optimize performance.

## When to Use `redux_logging`

- **Debugging**: When developing a Flutter application that uses Redux for state management, `redux_logging` can help track actions and state changes, making it easier to debug issues.
- **Monitoring**: For applications that require monitoring of state changes, this package provides a clear log of what actions are being dispatched and how the state is evolving.
- **Development**: It is primarily intended for use in development environments, as logging can introduce performance overhead in production.

## Features

- **Action Logging**: Logs every action dispatched to the Redux store.
- **State Change Logging**: Logs the state before and after each action is processed.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of the logging format and filtering of logged actions.
- **Integration**: Easily integrates with existing Redux setups in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `redux_logging`

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To use the `redux_logging` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  redux: ^5.0.0
  redux_logging: ^0.9.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependencies.

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart files where you want to use `redux_logging`, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:redux_logging/redux_logging.dart';
```

## Step 3: Set Up Middleware

You need to set up the logging middleware in your Redux store. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:redux/redux.dart';
import 'package:redux_logging/redux_logging.dart';

// Define your app state
class AppState {
  // Your state properties
}

// Define your actions
class IncrementAction {}

// Define your reducer
AppState appReducer(AppState state, dynamic action) {
  // Handle actions and return new state
}

// Create the store with logging middleware
final store = Store<AppState>(
  appReducer,
  initialState: AppState(),
  middleware: [LoggingMiddleware()],
);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target in `ios/Podfile` is set to at least 10.0.

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Store

Now that you have set up the store with logging middleware, you can dispatch actions and observe the logs in the console.

```dart
store.dispatch(IncrementAction());
```

This will log the action and the state changes in the console.

# Complete Example of Using `redux_logging`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:redux/redux.dart';
import 'package:redux_logging/redux_logging.dart';

// Define the application state
class AppState {
  int counter;

  AppState({this.counter = 0});
}

// Define actions
class IncrementAction {}

// Define the reducer
AppState appReducer(AppState state, dynamic action) {
  if (action is IncrementAction) {
    return AppState(counter: state.counter + 1); // Increment the counter
  }
  return state; // Return the current state if no action matches
}

// Main function to run the app
void main() {
  // Create the logging middleware
  final loggingMiddleware = LoggingMiddleware();

  // Create the Redux store with the logging middleware
  final store = Store<AppState>(
    appReducer,
    initialState: AppState(),
    middleware: [loggingMiddleware],
  );

  // Run the app
  runApp(MyApp(store: store));
}

// Define the main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final Store<AppState> store;

  MyApp({required this.store});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Redux Logging Example',
      home: CounterPage(store: store),
    );
  }
}

// Define a CounterPage widget
class CounterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  final Store<AppState> store;

  CounterPage({required this.store});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Redux Logging Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the current counter value
            StoreConnector<AppState, int>(
              converter: (store) => store.state.counter,
              builder: (context, counter) {
                return Text('Counter: $counter');
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to increment the counter
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                store.dispatch(IncrementAction()); // Dispatch increment action
              },
              child: Text('Increment'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the Redux store with the logging middleware.
// The `MyApp` widget is created, passing the store to it.
// Inside `MyApp`, the `CounterPage` widget is built, which displays the current counter value.
// The `StoreConnector` widget connects to the Redux store and retrieves the current counter value from the state.
// When the "Increment" button is pressed, it dispatches the `IncrementAction`, which triggers the reducer.
// The reducer updates the state by incrementing the counter, and the new state is logged by the logging middleware.
// The UI automatically updates to reflect the new counter value due to the state change.
