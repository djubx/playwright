# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Scrollable List Tab Scroller

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `scrollable_list_tab_scroller` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `scrollable_list_tab_scroller` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scrollable_list_tab_scroller: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a scrollable list with tabs.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scrollable_list_tab_scroller/scrollable_list_tab_scroller.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scrollable List Tab Scroller Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Scrollable List Tab Scroller'),
        ),
        body: ScrollableListTabScroller(
          tabs: [
            Tab(text: 'Tab 1'),
            Tab(text: 'Tab 2'),
            Tab(text: 'Tab 3'),
          ],
          tabViews: [
            // Content for Tab 1
            ListView.builder(
              itemCount: 20,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text('Item ${index + 1} in Tab 1'),
                );
              },
            ),
            // Content for Tab 2
            ListView.builder(
              itemCount: 15,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text('Item ${index + 1} in Tab 2'),
                );
              },
            ),
            // Content for Tab 3
            ListView.builder(
              itemCount: 10,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text('Item ${index + 1} in Tab 3'),
                );
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Scrollable List Tab Scroller'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold uses the ScrollableListTabScroller widget, which takes a list of tabs and corresponding tab views.
// 5. Each tab view is a ListView.builder that generates a list of items dynamically based on the tab selected.
// 6. When a user taps on a tab, the corresponding list of items is displayed, allowing for smooth scrolling through the items.
