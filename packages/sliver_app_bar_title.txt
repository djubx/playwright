# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Sliver App Bar Title

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `sliver_app_bar_title` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Package to Your Project
To get started, you need to add the `sliver_app_bar_title` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sliver_app_bar_title: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `SliverAppBarTitle` in a `SliverAppBar`.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sliver_app_bar_title/sliver_app_bar_title.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sliver App Bar Title Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        body: CustomScrollView(
          slivers: <Widget>[
            SliverAppBar(
              expandedHeight: 200.0, // Height of the app bar when expanded
              flexibleSpace: FlexibleSpaceBar(
                title: SliverAppBarTitle(
                  title: 'Dynamic Title', // The title to display
                  scrollOffset: 100.0, // The scroll offset at which the title changes
                  style: TextStyle(
                    fontSize: 20.0, // Font size when fully expanded
                    color: Colors.white, // Color when expanded
                  ),
                  collapsedStyle: TextStyle(
                    fontSize: 16.0, // Font size when collapsed
                    color: Colors.black, // Color when collapsed
                  ),
                ),
                background: Image.network(
                  'https://example.com/image.jpg', // Background image
                  fit: BoxFit.cover,
                ),
              ),
              pinned: true, // Keeps the app bar visible when scrolling
            ),
            SliverList(
              delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate(
                (BuildContext context, int index) {
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text('Item #$index'), // List items
                  );
                },
                childCount: 50, // Number of items in the list
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds a MaterialApp with a CustomScrollView.
// 3. Inside the CustomScrollView, a SliverAppBar is created with an expanded height of 200.0.
// 4. The FlexibleSpaceBar contains the SliverAppBarTitle, which displays a dynamic title.
// 5. The title changes its style based on the scroll offset defined.
// 6. A background image is set for the app bar, which will be visible when expanded.
// 7. The SliverList displays a list of items below the app bar, allowing for scrolling.
// 8. The app bar is pinned, meaning it will remain visible at the top as the user scrolls down.
