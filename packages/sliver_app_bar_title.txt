// The app flows as follows:
// 1. The user scrolls up, causing the app bar to expand to a height of 200 pixels.
// 2. The SliverAppBarTitle is displayed in the expanded app bar, with a font size of 24 and a color of white.
// 3. The user scrolls down, causing the app bar to collapse to a height of 56 pixels (the default height of a Material Design app bar).
// 4. The SliverAppBarTitle is still displayed in the collapsed app bar, but with a smaller font size and a different layout.
// 5. The user continues scrolling down, causing the SliverList to come into view.
// 6. The SliverList displays a list of ListTile widgets, each with a title property set to a Text widget.
