# Tutorial: Setting Up the Square Reader SDK

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Square Reader SDK in a Flutter application. We will cover platform-specific details for both Android and iOS.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `square_reader_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  square_reader_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.squareup.sdk.reader.applicationId"
            android:value="YOUR_SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID" />
    </application>

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
</manifest>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `build.gradle` file is set up correctly to include the necessary dependencies.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to connect to the card reader.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera to scan cards.</string>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed and run `pod install` in the `ios` directory.

## Step 3: Initialize the SDK

In your main Dart file, initialize the Square Reader SDK:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:square_reader_sdk/square_reader_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Square Reader SDK Demo',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Implement Payment Functionality

You can now implement the payment functionality in your application. Use the `SquareReaderSdk` class to handle payment processing.

# Complete Example of Square Reader SDK

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:square_reader_sdk/square_reader_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Square Reader SDK Demo',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  // Initialize the Square Reader SDK
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    SquareReaderSdk.initialize("YOUR_SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID");
  }

  // Function to start the payment process
  void _startPayment() async {
    try {
      // Create a payment request
      final paymentRequest = PaymentRequest(
        amount: 1000, // Amount in cents
        currency: 'USD',
      );

      // Start the payment process
      final result = await SquareReaderSdk.processPayment(paymentRequest);

      // Handle the payment result
      if (result.isSuccess) {
        // Payment was successful
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Successful!')),
        );
      } else {
        // Payment failed
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment Failed: ${result.errorMessage}')),
        );
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any exceptions
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Error: $e')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Square Reader SDK Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _startPayment,
          child: Text('Start Payment'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the Square Reader SDK with the application ID.
// 2. The user sees a button labeled "Start Payment".
// 3. When the button is pressed, the _startPayment function is called.
// 4. A payment request is created with the specified amount and currency.
// 5. The payment process is initiated, and the result is awaited.
// 6. If the payment is successful, a success message is displayed.
// 7. If the payment fails, an error message is shown.
// 8. Any exceptions during the payment process are caught and displayed as error messages.
```
