# State Beacon Flutter Package: An Overview

The `state_beacon` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify state management in Flutter applications. It provides a reactive and efficient way to manage and propagate state changes across your app, making it easier to build scalable and maintainable applications.

## When to Use State Beacon

State management is a crucial aspect of any Flutter application, especially as the app grows in complexity. The `state_beacon` package is particularly useful in scenarios where:

- You need to manage complex state across multiple widgets.
- You want to ensure that state changes are efficiently propagated without unnecessary rebuilds.
- You are looking for a solution that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter architecture patterns.

## Key Features

- **Reactive State Management**: Automatically updates UI components when the underlying state changes.
- **Minimal Boilerplate**: Reduces the amount of code needed to manage state, allowing developers to focus on building features.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Ensures that only the necessary parts of the UI are rebuilt, improving app performance.
- **Easy Integration**: Works well with other Flutter packages and can be easily integrated into existing projects.

# Setting Up and Using State Beacon

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `state_beacon` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `state_beacon` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  state_beacon: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

No additional configuration is required for Android. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, ensure your `Podfile` is using platform version 10.0 or higher:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to update your CocoaPods dependencies.

## Using State Beacon

### Step 3: Implementing State Management

1. **Create a State Class**: Define a class to hold your application's state.
2. **Initialize State Beacon**: Use the `RealFlutter` class to manage and update the state.
3. **Listen to State Changes**: Use widgets that react to state changes and update the UI accordingly.

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

Below is a complete example demonstrating the use of the `state_beacon` package in a Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:state_beacon/state_beacon.dart';

// Define a simple state class to hold a counter value
class CounterState {
  int counter;
  CounterState(this.counter);
}

// Create a RealFlutter class to manage the CounterState
class RealFlutter extends StateBeacon<CounterState> {
  RealFlutter() : super(CounterState(0));

  // Method to increment the counter
  void increment() {
    updateState((state) => state.counter++);
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // Initialize the RealFlutter instance
  final RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'State Beacon Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('State Beacon Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Use a StateListener to rebuild the widget when the state changes
          child: StateListener<CounterState>(
            beacon: realFlutter,
            builder: (context, state) {
              return Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: <Widget>[
                  Text(
                    'You have pushed the button this many times:',
                  ),
                  Text(
                    '${state.counter}',
                    style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: realFlutter.increment, // Increment the counter on button press
          tooltip: 'Increment',
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts by initializing the `RealFlutter` instance, which manages the `CounterState`.
// The `MyApp` widget is the root of the application, setting up a `MaterialApp` with a home screen.
// The home screen contains a `StateListener` widget that listens for changes in the `CounterState`.
// When the floating action button is pressed, the `increment` method is called, updating the state.
// The `StateListener` rebuilds its child widgets to reflect the updated counter value.
