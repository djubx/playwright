# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "ico" Package

## Installation
To get started with the "ico" package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ico: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your `Info.plist` file allows for the use of custom fonts. Add the following entry:

```xml
<key>UIAppFonts</key>
<array>
    <string>YourCustomFont.ttf</string>
</array>
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the "ico" package to display a custom icon.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ico/ico.dart'; // Import the ico package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ico Package Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Ico Package Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Icon(
            Ico.customIcon, // Use a custom icon from the ico package
            size: 100.0,
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the "ico" package and use a custom icon within a Flutter application.

# Complete Example of the "ico" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ico/ico.dart'; // Import the ico package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ico Package Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Ico Package Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display a custom icon from the ico package
              Icon(
                Ico.customIcon, // Replace with your custom icon
                size: 100.0,
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between the icon and text
              Text(
                'This is a custom icon!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with RealFlutter as the root widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold, which provides the basic structure of the app.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the app.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to stack the icon and text vertically.
// 7. The Icon widget displays a custom icon from the "ico" package.
// 8. A SizedBox is used to add space between the icon and the text.
// 9. The Text widget displays a message below the icon, indicating that it is a custom icon.
