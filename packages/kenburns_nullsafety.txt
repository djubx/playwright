        body: Center(
          child: KenBurns(
            image: AssetImage('assets/sample_image.jpg'), // Your image asset
            duration: Duration(seconds: 10), // Duration of the effect
            scale: 1.2, // Scale factor for zoom
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

# Complete Example of KenBurns Null Safety

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kenburns_nullsafety/kenburns.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Ken Burns Effect')),
        body: Center(
          // The KenBurns widget applies the effect to the image
          child: KenBurns(
            image: AssetImage('assets/sample_image.jpg'), // Load your image asset
            duration: Duration(seconds: 10), // Set the duration for the effect
            scale: 1.2, // Set the scale for zooming in
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class is instantiated, which builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, the KenBurns widget is used to display an image.
// 5. The KenBurns widget takes an AssetImage, a duration for the effect, and a scale factor.
// 6. The image will zoom in and pan over the specified duration, creating a dynamic visual effect.
