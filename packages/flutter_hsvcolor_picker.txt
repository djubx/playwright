# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_hsvcolor_picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_hsvcolor_picker` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_hsvcolor_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_hsvcolor_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the color picker.

# Complete Example: Implementing flutter_hsvcolor_picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hsvcolor_picker/flutter_hsvcolor_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'HSV Color Picker Example',
      home: ColorPickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ColorPickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ColorPickerScreenState createState() => _ColorPickerScreenState();
}

class _ColorPickerScreenState extends State<ColorPickerScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the selected color
  Color selectedColor = Colors.red;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('HSV Color Picker'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          // Display the selected color
          Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: selectedColor,
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // HSV Color Picker widget
          HSVColorPicker(
            // Callback to update the selected color
            onChanged: (color) {
              setState(() {
                selectedColor = color.toColor(); // Convert HSVColor to Color
              });
            },
            // Initial color
            initialColor: HSVColor.fromColor(selectedColor),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. ColorPickerScreen is a stateful widget that maintains the selected color.
// 4. The selected color is displayed in a container.
// 5. The HSVColorPicker widget allows users to select a color.
// 6. When the user selects a color, the onChanged callback updates the selectedColor state.
// 7. The UI rebuilds to reflect the new selected color in the container.
```
