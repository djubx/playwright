# Complete Example of Using native_screenshot_ext

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_screenshot_ext/native_screenshot_ext.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Screenshot Example',
      home: ScreenshotHome(),
    );
  }
}

class ScreenshotHome extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to capture the screenshot
  Future<void> captureScreenshot(BuildContext context) async {
    try {
      // Capture the screenshot and save it to the device
      final imagePath = await NativeScreenshotExt.capture();
      // Show a snackbar with the screenshot path
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Screenshot saved at: $imagePath')),
      );
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during screenshot capture
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Error capturing screenshot: $e')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Screenshot Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => captureScreenshot(context), // Call the capture function
          child: Text('Capture Screenshot'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (ScreenshotHome).
// 3. ScreenshotHome contains a button that, when pressed, calls the captureScreenshot function.
// 4. The captureScreenshot function attempts to capture a screenshot using the native_screenshot_ext package.
// 5. If successful, it shows a snackbar with the path of the saved screenshot; if it fails, it shows an error message.
