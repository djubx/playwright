```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flexi_productimage_slider/flexi_productimage_slider.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flexi Product Image Slider')),
        body: Center(
          child: FlexiProductImageSlider(
            images: [
              'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
              'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
              'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
            ],
            autoSlide: true,
            slideInterval: Duration(seconds: 3),
            indicatorDots: true,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a product image slider with three images. The slider automatically transitions between images every three seconds and shows indicator dots.

With this setup, you are ready to implement the `flexi_productimage_slider` in your Flutter application!

          // The FlexiProductImageSlider widget is used here to display images
          child: FlexiProductImageSlider(
            images: [
              // List of image URLs to be displayed in the slider
              'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
              'https://example.com/image2.jpg',

          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds the main UI.
// The MaterialApp widget provides the basic structure of the app.
// Inside the Scaffold, we have an AppBar with a title and a Center widget.
// The FlexiProductImageSlider is placed in the center of the screen.
// It takes a list of image URLs, enabling auto sliding every 3 seconds,
// and displays indicator dots to show the current image position.
// This creates an interactive and visually appealing image slider for users.
