# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using authorize_net_plugin

## Installation
To get started with the `authorize_net_plugin`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  authorize_net_plugin: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/authorize_net_plugin).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed and configured the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate a payment:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:authorize_net_plugin/authorize_net_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Authorize.Net Payment')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Call the payment processing function
              processPayment();
            },
            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void processPayment() async {
    // Initialize the payment request
    final response = await AuthorizeNetPlugin.processPayment(
      amount: '10.00',
      cardNumber: '4111111111111111',
      expirationDate: '12/25',
      cardCode: '123',
    );

    // Handle the response
    if (response.success) {
      print('Payment Successful: ${response.transactionId}');
    } else {
      print('Payment Failed: ${response.errorMessage}');
    }
  }
}
```

            child: Text('Pay Now'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void processPayment() async {
    // Initialize the payment request with necessary details
    final response = await AuthorizeNetPlugin.processPayment(
      amount: '10.00', // Amount to be charged
      cardNumber: '4111111111111111', // Sample card number
      expirationDate: '12/25', // Card expiration date
      cardCode: '123', // Card security code
    );

    // Handle the response from the payment processing
    if (response.success) {
      // If payment is successful, print the transaction ID
      print('Payment Successful: ${response.transactionId}');
    } else {
      // If payment fails, print the error message
      print('Payment Failed: ${response.errorMessage}');
    }
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The app starts and displays a button labeled "Pay Now".
// 2. When the user taps the button, the `processPayment` function is called.
// 3. Inside `processPayment`, a payment request is initiated with the specified amount and card details.
// 4. The response from the payment processing is awaited.
// 5. If the payment is successful, the transaction ID is printed to the console.
// 6. If the payment fails, the error message is printed to the console.
