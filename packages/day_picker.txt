# Tutorial: Setting Up the Day Picker Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **day_picker** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  day_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include permissions for accessing the calendar if your app requires it. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your calendar.</string>
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:day_picker/day_picker.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Day Picker
You can now use the **day_picker** widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it in your Flutter app.

# Complete Example of Day Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:day_picker/day_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Day Picker Example',
      home: DayPickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class DayPickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DayPickerExampleState createState() => _DayPickerExampleState();
}

class _DayPickerExampleState extends State<DayPickerExample> {
  // Variable to hold the selected date
  DateTime? selectedDate;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Day Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected date
            Text(
              selectedDate != null
                  ? 'Selected Date: ${selectedDate!.toLocal()}'.split(' ')[0]
                  : 'No Date Selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Day Picker widget
            DayPicker(
              selectedDate: selectedDate,
              onChanged: (date) {
                // Update the selected date when a date is picked
                setState(() {
                  selectedDate = date;
                });
              },
              // Optional: Customize the first and last date selectable
              firstDate: DateTime.now(),
              lastDate: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 30)),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. The DayPickerExample widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected date.
// 4. In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 5. The selected date is displayed as text, and if no date is selected, a default message is shown.
// 6. The DayPicker widget is included, which allows users to select a date.
// 7. When a date is selected, the onChanged callback updates the selectedDate state, triggering a rebuild to display the new date.
