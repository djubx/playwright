# flutter_sms_listener: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_sms_listener` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the `flutter_sms_listener` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_sms_listener: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: You need to add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS"/>
```

2. **SMS Receiver**: Ensure that your application has a receiver to handle incoming SMS messages. This is automatically handled by the package.

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: iOS does not allow direct SMS listening due to privacy concerns. Therefore, this package primarily supports Android. However, you can still implement SMS functionalities using other methods, such as using a web service for SMS verification.

## Basic Usage

To start listening for SMS messages, you can use the following code snippet in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sms_listener/flutter_sms_listener.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _smsMessage = "No messages yet";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start listening for incoming SMS messages
    FlutterSmsListener.onSmsReceived.listen((SmsMessage message) {
      setState(() {
        _smsMessage = message.body; // Update the UI with the new message
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("SMS Listener Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(_smsMessage), // Display the latest SMS message
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we set up a simple Flutter application that listens for incoming SMS messages and displays the latest message on the screen.

# Complete Example of flutter_sms_listener

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sms_listener/flutter_sms_listener.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _smsMessage = "No messages yet"; // Initialize message variable

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start listening for incoming SMS messages
    FlutterSmsListener.onSmsReceived.listen((SmsMessage message) {
      setState(() {
        _smsMessage = message.body; // Update the UI with the new message
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("SMS Listener Example")), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Text(_smsMessage), // Display the latest SMS message
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, we set up a listener for incoming SMS messages.
// 3. When an SMS is received, the listener triggers and updates the _smsMessage variable.
// 4. The UI is rebuilt to display the latest SMS message in the center of the screen.
// 5. If no messages have been received, it shows "No messages yet".
```
