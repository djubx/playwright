Here's a detailed technical blog on the "feature_folder_cli" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Feature Folder CLI Flutter Package

The **feature_folder_cli** package is a powerful tool designed to streamline the development process in Flutter applications by promoting a modular architecture. This package allows developers to create feature-based folder structures, making it easier to manage and scale applications as they grow. 

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **feature_folder_cli** package when:
- You are working on a large-scale Flutter application that requires a clear separation of features.
- You want to improve the maintainability of your codebase by organizing files and directories based on features rather than by type (e.g., models, views, controllers).
- You are collaborating with a team and need a consistent project structure to enhance collaboration and reduce merge conflicts.

## Key Features
- **Modular Structure**: Automatically generates a folder structure for each feature, including subfolders for models, views, controllers, and services.
- **Customizable Templates**: Allows developers to define their own templates for feature generation, ensuring consistency across the project.
- **CLI Integration**: Provides a command-line interface to easily create and manage features without manual setup.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms, ensuring that your features are well-organized regardless of the target platform.

By leveraging the **feature_folder_cli** package, developers can enhance their productivity and maintain a clean, organized codebase that is easy to navigate and scale.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Feature Folder CLI

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **feature_folder_cli** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter projects.

## Step 1: Installation

To get started, you need to add the **feature_folder_cli** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  feature_folder_cli: ^latest_version
```

Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/feature_folder_cli).

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Using the CLI

Once the package is installed, you can use the command line to create a new feature. Open your terminal and navigate to your Flutter project directory. Use the following command to create a new feature:

```bash
flutter pub run feature_folder_cli:create feature_name
```

Replace `feature_name` with the name of the feature you want to create. This command will generate a folder structure for the specified feature, including subfolders for models, views, controllers, and services.

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file is configured correctly to support the generated features. You may need to adjust the `minSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` to match the requirements of your features.

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to open the `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` file in Xcode and check that all necessary permissions and configurations are set up for the features you are implementing.

## Step 3: Customizing Templates

You can customize the templates used for generating features by modifying the template files provided in the package. This allows you to maintain a consistent coding style and structure across your project.

To customize a template, navigate to the package's template directory and modify the files as needed. After making changes, you can regenerate features using the CLI, and your custom templates will be applied.

By following these steps, you can effectively set up and use the **feature_folder_cli** package in your Flutter projects, leading to a more organized and maintainable codebase.

# Complete Example of Using Feature Folder CLI

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Feature Folder CLI Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Welcome to Feature Folder CLI Example!'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Navigate to the feature screen
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => FeatureScreen()),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Go to Feature Screen'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Feature screen widget
class FeatureScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Feature Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is a feature screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomeScreen, which is the first screen displayed.
// 4. The HomeScreen widget contains a button that, when pressed, navigates to the FeatureScreen.
// 5. The FeatureScreen displays a simple message indicating that it is a feature screen.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the **feature_folder_cli** package. The application consists of a home screen with a button that navigates to a feature screen. 

### Application Flow Summary
- The application starts with the `main()` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget.
- The `RealFlutter` widget sets up the `MaterialApp` with a title and theme.
- The `HomeScreen` widget is displayed first, featuring a button that navigates to the `FeatureScreen`.
- The `FeatureScreen` simply displays a message indicating that it is a feature screen.

This structure allows for easy expansion and organization of features as the application grows, showcasing the benefits of using the **feature_folder_cli** package.
