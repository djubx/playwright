# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Easy Sticky Header

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **easy_sticky_header** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_sticky_header: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:easy_sticky_header/easy_sticky_header.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup

To use the **easy_sticky_header** package, you need to wrap your scrollable list with the `EasyStickyHeader` widget. Here’s how to do it:

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Here’s a simple example of how to implement sticky headers in a list:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_sticky_header/easy_sticky_header.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Sticky Header Example')),
      body: EasyStickyHeader(
        header: Container(
          color: Colors.blue,
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Text('Sticky Header', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20)),
        ),
        content: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 100,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text('Item $index'),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple sticky header that remains at the top of the screen while the user scrolls through a list of items.

# Complete Example of Easy Sticky Header

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_sticky_header/easy_sticky_header.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Sticky Header Example')),
      body: EasyStickyHeader(
        // This is the sticky header that will remain at the top
        header: Container(
          color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the header
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0), // Padding around the header text
          child: Text(
            'Sticky Header', // Text displayed in the header
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20), // Text style
          ),
        ),
        // This is the content that will scroll
        content: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 100, // Total number of items in the list
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text('Item $index'), // Each item in the list
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The Scaffold widget provides the basic structure of the app, including an AppBar.
// 3. The EasyStickyHeader widget wraps around the header and content.
// 4. The header is defined as a Container with a blue background and text.
// 5. The content is a ListView.builder that generates a list of 100 items.
// 6. As the user scrolls, the header remains fixed at the top of the screen, providing context to the items below.
```
