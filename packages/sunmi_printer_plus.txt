# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using sunmi_printer_plus

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `sunmi_printer_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sunmi_printer_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Ensure that your Android app has the necessary permissions to access Bluetooth and network features. Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request Bluetooth permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to printers.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize the printer and print a receipt.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sunmi_printer_plus/sunmi_printer_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the printer
    SunmiPrinterPlus.initPrinter();
  }

  void printReceipt() async {
    // Start printing
    await SunmiPrinterPlus.startPrint();
    await SunmiPrinterPlus.printText("Receipt", styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center, bold: true));
    await SunmiPrinterPlus.printText("Thank you for your purchase!", styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center));
    await SunmiPrinterPlus.printNewLine();
    await SunmiPrinterPlus.printText("Total: \$10.00", styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center, bold: true));
    await SunmiPrinterPlus.printNewLine();
    await SunmiPrinterPlus.cutPaper();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Sunmi Printer Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: printReceipt,
          child: Text("Print Receipt"),
        ),
      ),
    );

# Complete Example of sunmi_printer_plus

import 'package:sunmi_printer_plus/sunmi_printer_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the printer
    SunmiPrinterPlus.initPrinter();
  }

  void printReceipt() async {
    // Start printing
    await SunmiPrinterPlus.startPrint();
    // Print the title of the receipt
    await SunmiPrinterPlus.printText("Receipt", styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center, bold: true));
    // Print a thank you message
    await SunmiPrinterPlus.printText("Thank you for your purchase!", styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center));
    // Add a new line for spacing
    await SunmiPrinterPlus.printNewLine();
    // Print the total amount
    await SunmiPrinterPlus.printText("Total: \$10.00", styles: PosStyles(align: PosAlign.center, bold: true));
    // Add another new line
    await SunmiPrinterPlus.printNewLine();
    // Cut the paper after printing
    await SunmiPrinterPlus.cutPaper();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Sunmi Printer Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: printReceipt, // Call the printReceipt function when the button is pressed
          child: Text("Print Receipt"),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes the Sunmi printer in the initState method.
// 2. When the user presses the "Print Receipt" button, the printReceipt function is called.
// 3. The function starts the printing process and prints the title "Receipt" centered and bold.
// 4. It then prints a thank you message, followed by a new line for spacing.
// 5. The total amount is printed next, also centered and bold.
// 6. Finally, the paper is cut after printing is complete.
