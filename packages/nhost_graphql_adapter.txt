# Nhost GraphQL Adapter for Flutter

The `nhost_graphql_adapter` is a powerful Flutter package that simplifies the integration of Nhost's GraphQL backend into Flutter applications. Nhost provides a serverless backend solution that includes authentication, storage, and real-time capabilities, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to build scalable applications without managing server infrastructure.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `nhost_graphql_adapter` when:
- You are building a Flutter application that requires a robust backend with GraphQL support.
- You want to leverage Nhost's features like authentication, file storage, and real-time subscriptions.
- You prefer a serverless architecture to reduce operational overhead.

## Key Features
- **GraphQL Integration**: Seamlessly connect your Flutter app to a Nhost GraphQL backend.
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Utilize subscriptions to receive real-time updates from your backend.
- **Authentication**: Easily manage user authentication and authorization.
- **File Storage**: Store and retrieve files using Nhost's storage capabilities.

By using this package, developers can focus on building their applications while relying on Nhost for backend services.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Nhost GraphQL Adapter in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `nhost_graphql_adapter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, add the `nhost_graphql_adapter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  nhost_graphql_adapter: ^0.1.0 # Check for the latest version
  graphql_flutter: ^5.0.0 # Required for GraphQL support
```

## Step 2: Configure Nhost

Before using the package, you need to set up an Nhost project. Follow these steps:

1. Go to [Nhost](https://nhost.io/) and create an account.
2. Create a new project and note down the GraphQL endpoint and the Nhost backend URL.
3. Enable authentication and storage features in your Nhost project settings.

## Step 3: Initialize the Adapter

In your Flutter application, initialize the `NhostGraphQLAdapter` in the `main.dart` file. Here’s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:graphql_flutter/graphql_flutter.dart';
import 'package:nhost_graphql_adapter/nhost_graphql_adapter.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // Initialize Nhost client
  final nhost = NhostClient(
    region: 'your-region', // e.g., 'us-east-1'
    backendUrl: 'https://backend-url.nhost.app', // Your Nhost backend URL
  );

  // Initialize GraphQL client
  final GraphQLClient client = GraphQLClient(
    link: NhostLink(nhost: nhost),
    cache: GraphQLCache(store: InMemoryStore()),
  );

  runApp(MyApp(client: client));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final GraphQLClient client;

  MyApp({required this.client});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GraphQLProvider(
      client: client,
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Nhost GraphQL Adapter Demo',
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` for internet access:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

#### iOS
- For iOS, ensure you have the correct configurations in your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests.

## Step 4: Using the Adapter

Now that we have set up the Nhost GraphQL adapter, we can use it to perform queries and mutations. Here’s an example of how to fetch data:

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Nhost GraphQL Adapter')),
      body: Query(
        options: QueryOptions(
          document: gql(r'''
            query GetUsers {
              users {
                id
                name
              }
            }
          '''),
        ),
        builder: (QueryResult result, {VoidCallback? refetch, FetchMore? fetchMore}) {
          if (result.isLoading) {
            return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
          }

          if (result.hasException) {
            return Center(child: Text(result.exception.toString()));
          }

          final List users = result.data!['users'];

          return ListView.builder(
            itemCount: users.length,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text(users[index]['name']),
              );
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple `HomeScreen` that fetches and displays a list of users from the Nhost backend.

# Complete Example: Nhost GraphQL Adapter in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:graphql_flutter/graphql_flutter.dart';
import 'package:nhost_graphql_adapter/nhost_graphql_adapter.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // Initialize Nhost client
  final nhost = NhostClient(
    region: 'your-region', // e.g., 'us-east-1'
    backendUrl: 'https://backend-url.nhost.app', // Your Nhost backend URL
  );

  // Initialize GraphQL client
  final GraphQLClient client = GraphQLClient(
    link: NhostLink(nhost: nhost),
    cache: GraphQLCache(store: InMemoryStore()),
  );

  runApp(MyApp(client: client));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final GraphQLClient client;

  MyApp({required this.client});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GraphQLProvider(
      client: client,
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Nhost GraphQL Adapter Demo',
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Nhost GraphQL Adapter')),
      body: Query(
        options: QueryOptions(
          document: gql(r'''
            query GetUsers {
              users {
                id
                name
              }
            }
          '''),
        ),
        builder: (QueryResult result, {VoidCallback? refetch, FetchMore? fetchMore}) {
          if (result.isLoading) {
            return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
          }

          if (result.hasException) {
            return Center(child: Text(result.exception.toString()));
          }

          final List users = result.data!['users'];

          return ListView.builder(
            itemCount: users.length,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text(users[index]['name']),
              );
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Nhost client and GraphQL client.
// 2. MyApp is the root widget that provides the GraphQL client to the widget tree.
// 3. HomeScreen is displayed as the main screen of the app.
// 4. In HomeScreen, a GraphQL query is executed to fetch users from the Nhost backend.
// 5. While loading, a CircularProgressIndicator is shown.
// 6. If there's an error, it displays the error message.
// 7. Once data is fetched, it displays the list of users in a ListView.
