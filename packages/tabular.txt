Here's a detailed technical blog on the "tabular" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Tabular Flutter Package

The **tabular** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed for displaying data in a structured, tabular format within Flutter applications. It provides a flexible and customizable way to present data, making it ideal for applications that require data representation, such as dashboards, reports, and data management tools.

## When to Use the Tabular Package

You should consider using the **tabular** package when:
- You need to display large datasets in a grid format.
- You want to implement features like sorting, filtering, and pagination.
- You require a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Columns**: Define the structure of your table with customizable columns.
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Built-in support for sorting and filtering data.
- **Pagination**: Efficiently manage large datasets with pagination.
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adjusts to different screen sizes and orientations.

The **tabular** package simplifies the process of creating data tables in Flutter, allowing developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about the underlying complexities of data presentation.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Tabular Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **tabular** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tabular: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Tabular Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a basic table using the **tabular** package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tabular/tabular.dart';
```

2. Create a simple Flutter app that uses the **tabular** package to display data.

# Complete Example: Flutter Application Using the Tabular Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tabular/tabular.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tabular Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Tabular Flutter Example'),
        ),
        body: DataTableWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DataTableWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data to display in the table
    final List<Map<String, dynamic>> data = [
      {'Name': 'Alice', 'Age': 30, 'City': 'New York'},
      {'Name': 'Bob', 'Age': 25, 'City': 'Los Angeles'},
      {'Name': 'Charlie', 'Age': 35, 'City': 'Chicago'},
    ];

    // Define the columns for the table
    final List<String> columns = ['Name', 'Age', 'City'];

    return Tabular(
      // Pass the data and columns to the Tabular widget
      data: data,
      columns: columns,
      // Enable sorting and filtering
      enableSorting: true,
      enableFiltering: true,
      // Customize the appearance
      headerStyle: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
      rowStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.black),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp and sets the title.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to a Scaffold widget, which provides the app structure.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the app.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains the DataTableWidget, which is responsible for displaying the table.
// 6. Inside DataTableWidget, sample data is defined as a list of maps.
// 7. The columns for the table are defined in a separate list.
// 8. The Tabular widget is used to create the table, passing the data and columns.
// 9. Sorting and filtering features are enabled, and styles for the header and rows are customized.
```
