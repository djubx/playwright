# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Focusable Control Builder

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **focusable_control_builder** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  focusable_control_builder: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations. Typically, no additional configurations are required for basic usage, but ensure your app's target SDK is set to a version that supports the package.

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to adjust your `Info.plist` file to ensure that your app complies with accessibility standards. Add the following key-value pair to enable accessibility features:

```xml
<key>UIAccessibilityDynamicallyEnabled</key>
<true/>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a focusable button using the **focusable_control_builder** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:focusable_control_builder/focusable_control_builder.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Focusable Control Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FocusableControlBuilder(
            onFocus: () {
              print('Button focused!');
            },
            onBlur: () {
              print('Button lost focus!');
            },
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                print('Button pressed!');
              },
              child: Text('Focusable Button'),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a focusable button. The `FocusableControlBuilder` wraps the `ElevatedButton`, allowing it to respond to focus events.

# Complete Example of Focusable Control Builder

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:focusable_control_builder/focusable_control_builder.dart';

// Main application class
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Focusable Control Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using FocusableControlBuilder to create a focusable button
          child: FocusableControlBuilder(
            // Callback when the button gains focus
            onFocus: () {
              print('Button focused!'); // Log when focused
            },
            // Callback when the button loses focus
            onBlur: () {
              print('Button lost focus!'); // Log when focus is lost
            },
            // The child widget that will be focusable
            child: ElevatedButton(
              // Action when the button is pressed
              onPressed: () {
                print('Button pressed!'); // Log button press
              },
              child: Text('Focusable Button'), // Button label
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a FocusableControlBuilder wraps an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button gains focus, the onFocus callback is triggered, logging "Button focused!" to the console.
// 5. When the button loses focus, the onBlur callback is triggered, logging "Button lost focus!" to the console.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered, logging "Button pressed!" to the console.
```
