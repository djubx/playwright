# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Flutter Widgets

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `animated_flutter_widgets` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml

  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_flutter_widgets: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

```

## Step 4: Using Animated Widgets

You can now use the animated widgets in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use an `AnimatedButton`:

```dart
AnimatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Action to perform on button press
  },
  child: Text('Click Me'),
);
```

This button will have a smooth animation when pressed, enhancing the user experience.

By following these steps, you can easily set up and start using the `animated_flutter_widgets` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using Animated Flutter Widgets

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_flutter_widgets/animated_flutter_widgets.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Flutter Widgets Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Widgets Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Using AnimatedButton from the package
              AnimatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action to perform on button press
                  print('Button Pressed!');
                },
                child: Text('Click Me'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Using AnimatedCard to display a card with animation
              AnimatedCard(
                child: Container(
                  width: 200,
                  height: 100,
                  color: Colors.blue,
                  child: Center(
                    child: Text(
                      'Animated Card',
                      style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the AnimatedButton and AnimatedCard vertically.
// 5. The AnimatedButton triggers an action when pressed, printing a message to the console.
// 6. The AnimatedCard displays a simple card with a text label, showcasing the animation capabilities of the package.
