// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user launches the app, and the `main` function is called.
// 2. The `main` function initializes the preferences using `NPreferences.init()`.
// 3. The `RealFlutter` widget is created, and its `initState` method is called.
// 4. In the `initState` method, the theme preference is retrieved using `NPreferences.getString('theme')`.
// 5. If the theme preference is not null, the `_theme` variable is updated, and the widget is rebuilt.
// 6. The user can switch between light and dark themes by pressing the corresponding buttons.
// 7. When a button is pressed, the theme preference is stored using `NPreferences.setString('theme', 'light')` or `NPreferences.setString('theme', 'dark')`.
// 8. The `_theme` variable is updated, and the widget is rebuilt to reflect the new theme.
