              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Log a custom event when the button is pressed
                  BrazePluginWeb.logCustomEvent('button_pressed', properties: {'button': 'example'});
                },
                child: Text('Log Event'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
