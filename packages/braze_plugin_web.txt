// This is the main entry point of the app.
// The Braze SDK is initialized with the API key and endpoint.
// The app then runs the RealFlutter widget.

// The RealFlutter widget is a stateful widget that tracks user behavior.
// When the user clicks the button, an in-app message is displayed.

// The app uses the BrazePluginWeb instance to log custom events and display in-app messages.
// The Braze SDK handles the underlying logic for tracking user behavior and displaying messages.

// This is a basic example of how to use the Braze Plugin Web package in a Flutter app.
// You can customize the app to fit your specific needs and use case.
