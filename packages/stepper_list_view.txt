# Tutorial: Using the Stepper List View Flutter Package
=====================================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stepper_list_view: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:stepper_list_view/stepper_list_view.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create a Stepper List View

Create a `StepperListView` widget and pass in a list of `Step` objects:
```dart
StepperListView(
  steps: [
    Step(
      title: Text('Step 1'),
      content: Text('This is the first step'),
    ),
    Step(
      title: Text('Step 2'),
      content: Text('This is the second step'),
    ),
  ],
)
```
### Step 4: Customize the Stepper Layout

You can customize the stepper layout by passing in a `StepperLayout` object:
```dart
StepperListView(
  steps: [
    // ...
  ],
  layout: StepperLayout(
    orientation: StepperOrientation.vertical,
    padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
  ),
)
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* On Android, you may need to add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file to enable scrolling:
```xml
<application
  android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
  ...>
```
* On iOS, you may need to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file to enable scrolling:
```xml
<key>UIRequiresFullScreen</key>
<true/>
```

// The app starts by running the main function, which creates a new instance of the MyApp widget.
// The MyApp widget is a stateless widget that wraps the entire app in a MaterialApp.
// The MaterialApp is a top-level widget that provides a basic material design visual layout structure.
// The home property of the MaterialApp is set to the MyHomePage widget, which is a stateful widget that contains the app's UI.
// The MyHomePage widget contains a Scaffold, which is a basic material design visual layout structure.
// The Scaffold contains an AppBar, which is a top app bar that displays the app's title.
// The body property of the Scaffold is set to a StepperListView, which is a widget that displays a list of steps.
// The StepperListView contains a list of Step widgets, each of which represents a single step in the process.
// The user can tap on a step to navigate to that step.
// The current step is stored in the _currentStep variable, which is updated when the user taps on a step.
