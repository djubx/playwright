### Tutorial

#### Setup Process

To get started with the `credit_card_scanner` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package dependency.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     credit_card_scanner: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/credit_card_scanner).

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**:
     - Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for camera access. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

     ```xml
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
     ```

   - **iOS**:
     - Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following key to request camera access:

     ```xml
     <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
     <string>We need access to the camera to scan your credit card.</string>
     ```

4. **Optimizations**: For better performance, consider testing on physical devices rather than emulators, as camera functionalities may not work as expected on emulators.

#### Using the Package

To use the `credit_card_scanner` package, you can follow this simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:credit_card_scanner/credit_card_scanner.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Credit Card Scanner')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Start the credit card scanning process
              final result = await CreditCardScanner.scanCard();
              // Handle the scanned card details
              if (result != null) {
                // Process the scanned card information
                print('Card Number: ${result.cardNumber}');
                print('Card Holder: ${result.cardHolder}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Scan Credit Card'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application with a button that initiates the credit card scanning process when pressed.

### Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:credit_card_scanner/credit_card_scanner.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Credit Card Scanner')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Start the credit card scanning process
              final result = await CreditCardScanner.scanCard();
              // Handle the scanned card details
              if (result != null) {
                // Process the scanned card information
                print('Card Number: ${result.cardNumber}');
                print('Card Holder: ${result.cardHolder}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Scan Credit Card'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. A Scaffold widget is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is displayed.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. The CreditCardScanner.scanCard() method is called to initiate the scanning process.
// 6. If a card is successfully scanned, the card number and holder's name are printed to the console.
// 7. This simple flow allows users to scan their credit cards easily and efficiently.
