# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Keyboard Hider

## Installation
To add the `keyboard_hider` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  keyboard_hider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. The package works out of the box.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your app's `Info.plist` file includes the following key to allow keyboard dismissal:

```xml
<key>UIKeyboardAppearance</key>
<string>light</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `keyboard_hider` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:keyboard_hider/keyboard_hider.dart';
```

You can then use the `KeyboardHider` class to manage keyboard visibility. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to hide the keyboard when tapping outside of a text field.

```dart
// Inside your widget build method
GestureDetector(
  onTap: () {
    KeyboardHider.hideKeyboard(context); // Hides the keyboard
  },
  child: Container(
    // Your UI here
  ),
);
```

This setup allows you to dismiss the keyboard easily, enhancing the user experience in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Keyboard Hider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:keyboard_hider/keyboard_hider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Keyboard Hider Example',
      home: KeyboardHiderExample(),
    );
  }
}

class KeyboardHiderExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Keyboard Hider Example'),
      ),
      body: GestureDetector(
        // Detect taps outside of the text field
        onTap: () {
          KeyboardHider.hideKeyboard(context); // Hides the keyboard
        },
        child: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  labelText: 'Enter your name',
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  KeyboardHider.hideKeyboard(context); // Hides the keyboard on button press
                  // Additional actions can be added here
                },
                child: Text('Submit'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. The KeyboardHiderExample widget is displayed, which contains a GestureDetector.
// 4. The GestureDetector listens for taps on the screen. When tapped, it calls KeyboardHider.hideKeyboard(context) to hide the keyboard.
// 5. Inside the body, there is a TextField for user input and a button labeled 'Submit'.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it also hides the keyboard and can trigger additional actions as needed.
// 7. This setup ensures that the keyboard is dismissed when the user interacts with the UI, improving the overall user experience.
