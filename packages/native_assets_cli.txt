Here's a detailed technical blog on the `native_assets_cli` Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Native Assets CLI Flutter Package

The `native_assets_cli` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to manage native assets efficiently. This package simplifies the process of integrating native resources, such as images, fonts, and other files, into Flutter applications. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) that automates the generation of necessary configurations for both Android and iOS platforms.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `native_assets_cli` package when:
- You have a Flutter application that requires native assets that need to be bundled with the app.
- You want to streamline the process of managing these assets across different platforms.
- You need to ensure that your assets are correctly referenced in both Android and iOS builds without manual configuration.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Automatically configures assets for both Android and iOS.
- **CLI Integration**: Provides a command-line interface for easy asset management.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to specify asset paths and configurations.
- **Error Handling**: Offers clear error messages and logs to help troubleshoot issues.

By leveraging the `native_assets_cli` package, developers can focus more on building their applications rather than managing asset configurations.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Native Assets CLI

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `native_assets_cli` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter project.

## Step 1: Installation

To get started, you need to add the `native_assets_cli` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  native_assets_cli: ^latest_version
```

Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/native_assets_cli).

## Step 2: Running the CLI

After adding the package, you can run the CLI commands. Open your terminal and navigate to your Flutter project directory. Use the following command to initialize the native assets configuration:

```bash
flutter pub run native_assets_cli init
```

This command will create the necessary configuration files for both Android and iOS.

## Step 3: Adding Assets

To add assets, create a directory in your project (e.g., `assets/`). Place your native files (images, fonts, etc.) in this directory. Then, you can use the CLI to register these assets:

```bash
flutter pub run native_assets_cli add assets/
```

This command will update the configuration files to include the specified assets.

## Step 4: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file includes the following:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    sourceSets {
        main {
            jniLibs.srcDirs = ['src/main/jniLibs', 'src/main/assets']
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration allows the Android build system to recognize the native assets.

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add the assets to your Xcode project. Open your project in Xcode, and drag the asset files into the `Runner` project. Ensure that the files are included in the "Copy Bundle Resources" section of your build settings.

## Step 5: Building the Application

Once you have added and configured your assets, you can build your Flutter application as usual:

```bash
flutter build apk  // For Android
flutter build ios  // For iOS
```

This will compile your application with the native assets included.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage native assets in your Flutter application using the `native_assets_cli` package.

# Complete Example of Using Native Assets CLI

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Native Assets CLI Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Native Assets CLI Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying an image asset
              Image.asset('assets/images/sample_image.png'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Displaying a text asset
              Text(
                'This is a sample text asset.',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class extends StatelessWidget, which means it is immutable and does not maintain any state.
// 3. The build method returns a MaterialApp widget, which is the root of the application.
// 4. Inside the MaterialApp, we define a Scaffold widget that provides a structure for the visual interface.
// 5. The AppBar widget displays the title of the application.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 7. A Column widget is used to arrange the child widgets vertically.
// 8. The first child is an Image widget that displays an image from the assets folder.
// 9. The second child is a Text widget that displays a sample text.
// 10. The application will display the image and text when run, demonstrating the use of native assets.
```

In summary, the `native_assets_cli` package provides a streamlined approach to managing native assets in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, developers can easily integrate and utilize native resources across both Android and iOS platforms. The complete example demonstrates how to display an image and text asset, showcasing the package's capabilities in a practical application.
