# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Image Picker Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `image_picker_android` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_picker_android: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker_android).

## Step 2: Configure for Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to access the camera and storage. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

For iOS, you need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select photos.</string>
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:image_picker_android/image_picker_android.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Image Picker

You can now use the `ImagePicker` class to select images or videos. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
final ImagePicker _picker = ImagePicker();

// Function to pick an image from the gallery
Future<void> pickImageFromGallery() async {
  final XFile? image = await _picker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
  if (image != null) {
    // Handle the selected image
  }
}

// Function to capture an image using the camera
Future<void> captureImageWithCamera() async {
  final XFile? image = await _picker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.camera);
  if (image != null) {
    // Handle the captured image
  }
}
```

This setup allows you to easily pick images from the gallery or capture new ones using the camera.

# Complete Example of Using Image Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_picker_android/image_picker_android.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Picker Example',
      home: ImagePickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ImagePickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImagePickerScreenState createState() => _ImagePickerScreenState();
}

class _ImagePickerScreenState extends State<ImagePickerScreen> {
  XFile? _image; // Variable to hold the selected image

  // Instance of ImagePicker
  final ImagePicker _picker = ImagePicker();

  // Function to pick an image from the gallery
  Future<void> _pickImageFromGallery() async {
    final XFile? image = await _picker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
    setState(() {
      _image = image; // Update the state with the selected image
    });
  }

  // Function to capture an image using the camera
  Future<void> _captureImageWithCamera() async {
    final XFile? image = await _picker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.camera);
    setState(() {
      _image = image; // Update the state with the captured image
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the selected image if available
            _image != null
                ? Image.file(File(_image!.path))
                : Text('No image selected.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to pick an image from the gallery
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImageFromGallery,
              child: Text('Pick Image from Gallery'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            // Button to capture an image using the camera
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _captureImageWithCamera,
              child: Text('Capture Image with Camera'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets ImagePickerScreen as the home.
// 3. ImagePickerScreen is a stateful widget that manages the state of the selected image.
// 4. The _pickImageFromGallery function is called when the user taps the "Pick Image from Gallery" button.
// 5. The _captureImageWithCamera function is called when the user taps the "Capture Image with Camera" button.
// 6. When an image is selected or captured, the state is updated, and the UI reflects the selected image.
```
