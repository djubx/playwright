# Complete Example of flutter_emoji

Hereâ€™s a fully functional Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the `flutter_emoji` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_emoji/flutter_emoji.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Emoji Example',
      home: EmojiHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class EmojiHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EmojiHomePageState createState() => _EmojiHomePageState();
}

class _EmojiHomePageState extends State<EmojiHomePage> {
  // Create an instance of the EmojiParser
  final EmojiParser parser = EmojiParser();
  String emojiText = ''; // Variable to hold the emoji text

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Emoji Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // TextField for user input
            TextField(
              onChanged: (text) {
                // Update the emojiText variable with the converted emoji
                setState(() {
                  emojiText = parser.emojify(text); // Convert text to emoji
                });
              },
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Type something with emojis (e.g., :smile:)',
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the converted emoji text
            Text(
              emojiText,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The home of the MaterialApp is set to EmojiHomePage, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. Inside EmojiHomePage, we create an instance of EmojiParser to handle emoji conversion.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing a TextField and a Text widget.
// 6. When the user types in the TextField, the onChanged callback is triggered, updating the emojiText variable with the converted emoji text.
// 7. The Text widget displays the emoji text in real-time as the user types.
```
