# GT4 Flutter Plugin: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the **gt4_flutter_plugin** and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the **gt4_flutter_plugin** to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml

  gt4_flutter_plugin: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Basic Usage

To use the **gt4_flutter_plugin**, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gt4_flutter_plugin/gt4_flutter_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'GT4 Flutter Plugin Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the GT4 plugin
    GT4Plugin.initialize();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('GT4 Plugin Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to GT4 Flutter Plugin!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the GT4 plugin in the `initState` method of our `RealFlutter` widget. This ensures that the plugin is ready to use when the widget is built.

# Complete Example of GT4 Flutter Plugin

Here is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the **gt4_flutter_plugin**.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gt4_flutter_plugin/gt4_flutter_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'GT4 Flutter Plugin Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _data = "No data received";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the GT4 plugin
    GT4Plugin.initialize();

    // Fetch data from GT4 platform
    _fetchData();
  }

  // Method to fetch data from GT4
  void _fetchData() async {
    try {
      // Simulate fetching data from GT4
      String data = await GT4Plugin.getData();
      setState(() {
        _data = data; // Update the state with fetched data
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _data = "Error fetching data: $e"; // Handle errors
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('GT4 Plugin Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Fetched Data:'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_data), // Display fetched data
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// `MyApp` is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// The home widget is `RealFlutter`, a StatefulWidget that manages its state.
// In the `initState` method, the GT4 plugin is initialized to prepare for data fetching.
// The `_fetchData` method is called to retrieve data from the GT4 platform asynchronously.
// If data is successfully fetched, it updates the `_data` state variable, which triggers a rebuild.
// The UI displays the fetched data or an error message if the fetch fails.
// The main UI consists of a simple Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget displaying the data.
