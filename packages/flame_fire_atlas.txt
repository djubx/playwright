<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Flame Fire Atlas Flutter Package

The **flame_fire_atlas** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate 2D game graphics into their applications. This package is built on top of the Flame game engine, which provides a robust framework for game development in Flutter. The **flame_fire_atlas** package specifically focuses on handling sprite sheets and animations, making it easier to create visually appealing games and applications.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **flame_fire_atlas** package when:
- You are developing a 2D game and need to manage multiple sprite animations efficiently.
- You want to create visually rich applications that require smooth animations and transitions.
- You are looking for a way to optimize your game's performance by using sprite atlases instead of individual image files.

## Features

- **Sprite Sheet Management**: Easily load and manage sprite sheets for your animations.
- **Animation Support**: Create smooth animations using the built-in animation capabilities.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduce the number of image files loaded into memory by using sprite atlases.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flame Fire Atlas

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **flame_fire_atlas** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **flame_fire_atlas** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flame_fire_atlas: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21  // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Minimum iOS version required
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to load a sprite sheet and create an animation.

1. Import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flame/game.dart';
import 'package:flame_fire_atlas/flame_fire_atlas.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

2. Create a new class that extends `BaseGame`:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends BaseGame {
  // Your game logic will go here
}
```

3. Load your sprite sheet and create animations within the `RealFlutter` class.

This setup will allow you to create a basic game using the **flame_fire_atlas** package.

# Complete Example of Flame Fire Atlas

```dart
import 'package:flame/game.dart';  // Import the Flame game engine
import 'package:flame_fire_atlas/flame_fire_atlas.dart';  // Import the flame_fire_atlas package
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';  // Import Flutter material package

// Define the main class that extends BaseGame
class RealFlutter extends BaseGame {
  late SpriteAnimation animation;  // Declare a variable for the animation

  // Constructor to load the sprite sheet
  RealFlutter() {
    // Load the sprite sheet from the assets
    loadSpriteAnimation();
  }

  // Function to load the sprite animation
  void loadSpriteAnimation() async {
    // Load the sprite sheet and create an animation
    final spriteSheet = await Flame.images.load('spritesheet.png');  // Load the sprite sheet image
    final spriteAnimationData = SpriteAnimationData.sequenced(  // Create animation data
      amount: 4,  // Number of frames in the sprite sheet
      stepTime: 0.1,  // Time per frame
      textureSize: Vector2(64, 64),  // Size of each frame
    );
    animation = SpriteAnimation.fromFrameData(spriteSheet, spriteAnimationData);  // Create the animation
  }

  // Override the render method to draw the animation
  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    super.render(canvas);  // Call the superclass render method
    animation.getSprite().render(canvas, position: Vector2(100, 100));  // Render the animation at a specific position
  }

  // Override the update method to update the animation
  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    super.update(dt);  // Call the superclass update method
    animation.update(dt);  // Update the animation
  }
}

// Main function to run the Flutter app
void main() {
  runApp(GameWidget(game: RealFlutter()));  // Run the game widget with the RealFlutter game
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The RealFlutter class is created, extending BaseGame.
// 2. In the constructor, the loadSpriteAnimation method is called to load the sprite sheet.
// 3. The loadSpriteAnimation method loads the sprite sheet and creates an animation using the SpriteAnimationData.
// 4. The render method is overridden to draw the animation on the canvas at a specified position.
// 5. The update method is overridden to update the animation state based on the time elapsed.
// 6. The main function runs the Flutter app, displaying the game using the GameWidget.
```
