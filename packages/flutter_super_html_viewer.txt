# flutter_super_html_viewer: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_super_html_viewer`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_super_html_viewer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_super_html_viewer).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are loading images from the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_super_html_viewer`, you can create a simple widget that takes HTML content as input. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_super_html_viewer/flutter_super_html_viewer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    String htmlContent = """
      <h1>Hello, Flutter!</h1>
      <p>This is a simple HTML viewer.</p>
      <img src='https://example.com/image.png' />
    """;

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('HTML Viewer Example')),
      body: HtmlViewer(
        html: htmlContent,
        // You can customize the viewer here
        onTapLink: (url) {
          // Handle link taps
          print('Link tapped: $url');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application that displays HTML content using the `HtmlViewer` widget. The `onTapLink` callback allows you to handle link interactions.

With this setup, you can easily render HTML content in your Flutter app!

# Complete Example of flutter_super_html_viewer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_super_html_viewer/flutter_super_html_viewer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Super HTML Viewer',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample HTML content to display
    String htmlContent = """
      <h1>Welcome to Flutter Super HTML Viewer</h1>
      <p>This package allows you to render HTML content easily.</p>
      <img src='https://example.com/image.png' />
      <p>Click <a href='https://flutter.dev'>here</a> to learn more about Flutter.</p>
    """;

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('HTML Viewer Example')),
      body: HtmlViewer(
        html: htmlContent,
        // Callback for link taps
        onTapLink: (url) {
          // Print the tapped link to the console
          print('Link tapped: $url');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main screen.
// 4. In RealFlutter, we define a string containing HTML content.
// 5. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and body.
// 6. The HtmlViewer widget is used to render the HTML content.
// 7. The onTapLink callback is defined to handle link taps, printing the URL to the console.
// 8. When the app runs, it displays the HTML content, and tapping links will trigger the callback.
