# Overview of the json_object_lite Flutter Package

The `json_object_lite` package is a lightweight and efficient library designed for handling JSON data in Flutter applications. It simplifies the process of parsing and serializing JSON objects, making it easier for developers to work with APIs and manage data structures. This package is particularly useful when dealing with complex JSON data, as it provides a straightforward way to convert JSON into Dart objects and vice versa.

## When to Use json_object_lite

- **API Integration**: When your Flutter app needs to communicate with RESTful APIs that return JSON data.
- **Data Management**: For applications that require efficient handling of JSON data structures, such as configuration files or local storage.
- **Serialization/Deserialization**: When you need to convert Dart objects to JSON format and back, especially in data-driven applications.

## Key Features

- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, making it suitable for performance-sensitive applications.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for parsing and serializing JSON data.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that the data types are correctly handled during serialization and deserialization.
- **Customizable**: Allows for custom serialization logic if needed.

# Setting Up and Using json_object_lite

## Installation

To add the `json_object_lite` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  json_object_lite: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `json_object_lite` package, you need to create a Dart class that represents the structure of your JSON data. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:json_object_lite/json_object_lite.dart';

class User extends JsonObject {
  String? name;
  int? age;

  User({this.name, this.age});

  @override
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() {
    return {
      'name': name,
      'age': age,
    };
  }

  @override
  void fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    name = json['name'];
    age = json['age'];
  }
}
```

In this example, the `User` class extends `JsonObject`, allowing it to easily convert between JSON and Dart objects.

# Complete Example of json_object_lite in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:json_object_lite/json_object_lite.dart';

// Define the User class that extends JsonObject
class User extends JsonObject {
  String? name; // User's name
  int? age; // User's age

  User({this.name, this.age});

  // Convert User object to JSON
  @override
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() {
    return {
      'name': name,
      'age': age,
    };
  }

  // Populate User object from JSON
  @override
  void fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    name = json['name'];
    age = json['age'];
  }
}

// Main application class
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'json_object_lite Example',
      home: UserScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class UserScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a User object
    User user = User(name: 'John Doe', age: 30);

    // Convert User object to JSON
    Map<String, dynamic> userJson = user.toJson();

    // Simulate receiving JSON data (e.g., from an API)
    Map<String, dynamic> receivedJson = {
      'name': 'Jane Doe',
      'age': 25,
    };

    // Create a new User object from received JSON
    User newUser = User();
    newUser.fromJson(receivedJson);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('User Information'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Original User: ${userJson['name']}, Age: ${userJson['age']}'),
            Text('Received User: ${newUser.name}, Age: ${newUser.age}'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets UserScreen as the home widget.
// 3. UserScreen creates an instance of User with initial data and converts it to JSON.
// 4. It simulates receiving JSON data and creates a new User object from that data.
// 5. The UI displays both the original and received user information on the screen.
