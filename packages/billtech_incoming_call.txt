# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the billtech_incoming_call Package

## Installation
To get started with the `billtech_incoming_call` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  billtech_incoming_call: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/billtech_incoming_call).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG"/>
   ```

2. **Service Declaration**: Also, declare the service in the same `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <service android:name="com.billtech.incomingcall.CallReceiver" android:exported="true">
       <intent-filter>
           <action android:name="android.intent.action.PHONE_STATE"/>
       </intent-filter>
   </service>
   ```

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires access to contacts to manage calls.</string>
   <key>NSCallKitUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires access to call management features.</string>
   ```

2. **Capabilities**: Ensure that you enable the "Background Modes" capability and check "Voice over IP".

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured the necessary permissions, you can start using it in your Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:billtech_incoming_call/billtech_incoming_call.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the incoming call listener
    BilltechIncomingCall.onIncomingCall.listen((call) {
      // Handle the incoming call
      print("Incoming call from: ${call.caller}");
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Incoming Call Example')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Listening for incoming calls...')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we set up a listener for incoming calls and print the caller's information to the console. You can replace the print statement with any custom logic you want to implement when a call is received.

# Complete Example of Using billtech_incoming_call

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:billtech_incoming_call/billtech_incoming_call.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the incoming call listener
    BilltechIncomingCall.onIncomingCall.listen((call) {
      // Handle the incoming call
      print("Incoming call from: ${call.caller}");
      // You can add custom logic here, such as showing a dialog or notification
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Incoming Call Example')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Listening for incoming calls...')),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. In the initState method, we set up a listener for incoming calls using the BilltechIncomingCall package.
// 3. When an incoming call is detected, the listener is triggered, and we print the caller's information to the console.
// 4. The app displays a simple UI with a message indicating that it is listening for incoming calls.
// 5. You can extend the functionality by adding custom logic in the listener to handle incoming calls as needed.
