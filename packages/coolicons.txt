# Complete Example of Coolicons in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:coolicons/coolicons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Coolicons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Coolicons Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a Coolicon
              Icon(
                Coolicons.someIcon, // Replace 'someIcon' with the desired icon name
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying another Coolicon
              Icon(
                Coolicons.anotherIcon, // Replace 'anotherIcon' with another icon name
                size: 50.0,
                color: Colors.green,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Coolicons Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, two Icon widgets are displayed, each using a different Coolicon.
// 6. The first icon is red and the second is green, both sized at 50.0.
// 7. A SizedBox is used to add space between the two icons for better visual separation.
