# Setting Up and Using the never_behind_keyboard Package

## Installation
To use the `never_behind_keyboard` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  never_behind_keyboard: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/never_behind_keyboard).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the appropriate settings. You may want to set the `windowSoftInputMode` to `adjustResize` to allow the layout to resize when the keyboard appears. This can be done by adding the following line within the `<activity>` tag:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
```

### iOS
For iOS, no additional configuration is typically required. The package should work out of the box, but ensure that your app's deployment target is set to a version that supports the necessary features.

## Using the Package
To use the `never_behind_keyboard` package, wrap your input fields with the `NeverBehindKeyboard` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:never_behind_keyboard/never_behind_keyboard.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Never Behind Keyboard Example')),
        body: NeverBehindKeyboard(
          child: Column(
            children: [
              TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your name'),
              ),
              TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your message'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, the `NeverBehindKeyboard` widget wraps a `Column` containing two `TextField` widgets. When the keyboard appears, the view will automatically adjust to keep the focused input field visible.

# Complete Example of Using never_behind_keyboard

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:never_behind_keyboard/never_behind_keyboard.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Never Behind Keyboard Example')),
        body: NeverBehindKeyboard(
          // The NeverBehindKeyboard widget ensures that the input fields are visible
          child: Column(
            // Using a Column to stack the input fields vertically
            children: [
              TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your name'),
                // The first TextField for user name input
              ),
              TextField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your message'),
                // The second TextField for user message input
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body is wrapped in the NeverBehindKeyboard widget, which manages keyboard visibility.
// 5. Inside the body, a Column widget is used to stack two TextFields vertically.
// 6. When the user taps on either TextField, the keyboard appears, and the view adjusts to keep the focused TextField visible.
