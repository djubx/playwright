// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a form containing three text fields and a submit button.
// 2. The user interacts with the text fields and enters some text.
// 3. When the user taps on a text field, the keyboard is displayed and the NeverBehindKeyboard widget ensures that the text field is visible by scrolling the screen.
// 4. The user can interact with the text fields and enter more text, and the NeverBehindKeyboard widget will continue to ensure that the text fields are visible.
// 5. When the user taps the submit button, the form is validated and if it is valid, the app proceeds with submission.
