# Stream Duration Flutter Package
=====================================

The `stream_duration` Flutter package is a utility library that helps you to calculate the duration of a stream. It provides a simple and efficient way to measure the time it takes for a stream to complete.

### When to Use

You can use this package in scenarios where you need to measure the time it takes for a stream to complete, such as:

* Measuring the time it takes for a file to download
* Measuring the time it takes for a network request to complete
* Measuring the time it takes for a database query to execute

### Features

The `stream_duration` package provides the following features:

* Measures the time it takes for a stream to complete
* Provides a simple and efficient way to calculate the duration of a stream
* Works with both synchronous and asynchronous streams

# Tutorial
==========

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process and explain how to use the `stream_duration` package.

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To use the `stream_duration` package, you need to add it to your project. You can do this by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  stream_duration: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to get the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

To use the `stream_duration` package, you need to import it in your Dart file. You can do this by adding the following line at the top of your file:
```dart
import 'package:stream_duration/stream_duration.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create a Stream

To measure the duration of a stream, you need to create a stream first. You can create a stream using the `Stream` class. For example:
```dart
Stream<int> myStream = Stream<int>.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), (i) => i);
```
This stream will emit an integer every second.

### Step 4: Measure the Duration of the Stream

To measure the duration of the stream, you can use the `StreamDuration` class. For example:
```dart
StreamDuration duration = StreamDuration(myStream);
```
This will measure the time it takes for the stream to complete.

### Platform-Specific Details

The `stream_duration` package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, there are some platform-specific details you need to be aware of:

* On Android, the `stream_duration` package uses the `SystemClock` class to measure the time.
* On iOS, the `stream_duration` package uses the `NSDate` class to measure the time.

### Required Configurations or Optimizations

There are no required configurations or optimizations for the `stream_duration` package.

// This is the main file of the Flutter application.
// It creates a Material app with a home page that displays the duration of a stream.
// The stream is created using the `Stream` class and is periodic, meaning it emits an integer every second.
// The duration of the stream is measured using the `StreamDuration` class.
// The duration is displayed on the home page as a text widget.

// The app uses the `MaterialApp` widget to create a Material app.
// The `MaterialApp` widget is the top-level widget for a Material app.
// It provides a basic Material app layout structure.

// The app uses the `MyHomePage` widget to create the home page.
// The `MyHomePage` widget is a stateful widget that displays the duration of the stream.
// It uses the `StreamDuration` class to measure the duration of the stream.
