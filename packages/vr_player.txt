# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the VR Player Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `vr_player` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `vr_player` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vr_player: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/vr_player).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required for VR
    }
}
```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for VR experiences.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the microphone for audio input.</string>
```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 11.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the VR Player

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. 

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:vr_player/vr_player.dart';
```

2. Create a simple VR player widget:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('VR Player Example'),
      ),
      body: VRPlayer(
        url: 'https://example.com/your-vr-content', // URL to your VR content
        onCreated: (controller) {
          // Controller is ready to use
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic VR player that loads content from a specified URL. You can replace the URL with your own VR content.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered the setup and usage of the `vr_player` package in a Flutter application. We discussed platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS and provided a simple example of how to create a VR player widget. With this foundation, you can start building immersive VR experiences in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of a Flutter Application Using VR Player

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vr_player/vr_player.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'VR Player Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home to our VR player widget
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('VR Player Example'), // Title of the app
      ),
      body: VRPlayer(
        url: 'https://example.com/your-vr-content', // URL to your VR content
        onCreated: (controller) {
          // This callback is called when the VR player is created
          // You can use the controller to control the VR player
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing the VRPlayer widget.
// 4. The VRPlayer widget loads VR content from the specified URL and provides a callback when the player is created.
// 5. The user can interact with the VR content once it is loaded, providing an immersive experience.
