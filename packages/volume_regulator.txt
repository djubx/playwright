# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Volume Regulator Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the volume_regulator package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  volume_regulator: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to manage audio settings. Add the following permission inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to ensure proper audio playback:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio features.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Volume Regulator

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the volume regulator in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:volume_regulator/volume_regulator.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and use its methods to control the volume.

### Example Code

Refer to the complete example section below for a fully functional implementation.

# Complete Example of Using the Volume Regulator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:volume_regulator/volume_regulator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Volume Regulator Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _currentVolume = 0.5; // Initial volume level (0.0 to 1.0)

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the volume regulator
    VolumeRegulator.setVolume(_currentVolume);
  }

  void _increaseVolume() {
    setState(() {
      if (_currentVolume < 1.0) {
        _currentVolume += 0.1; // Increase volume by 0.1
        VolumeRegulator.setVolume(_currentVolume); // Update the volume
      }
    });
  }

  void _decreaseVolume() {
    setState(() {
      if (_currentVolume > 0.0) {
        _currentVolume -= 0.1; // Decrease volume by 0.1
        VolumeRegulator.setVolume(_currentVolume); // Update the volume
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Volume Regulator Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Current Volume: ${(_currentVolume * 100).round()}%',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _increaseVolume,
              child: Text('Increase Volume'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _decreaseVolume,
              child: Text('Decrease Volume'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, setting RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages the current volume state.
// 4. In the initState method, the initial volume is set to 0.5 (50%).
// 5. The _increaseVolume and _decreaseVolume methods adjust the volume by 0.1 and update the state.
// 6. The build method creates a simple UI displaying the current volume and buttons to adjust it.
// 7. When the buttons are pressed, the volume is increased or decreased, and the UI updates accordingly.
