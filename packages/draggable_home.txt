# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Draggable Home

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **draggable_home** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **draggable_home** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  draggable_home: ^0.4.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:draggable_home/draggable_home.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Draggable Home

You can now use the `DraggableHome` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:draggable_home/draggable_home.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return DraggableHome(
      title: Text("Draggable Home Example"),
      headerWidget: Container(
        color: Colors.blue,
        height: 200,
        child: Center(child: Text("Header", style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24))),
      ),
      body: [
        Container(color: Colors.red, height: 100, child: Center(child: Text("Item 1"))),
        Container(color: Colors.green, height: 100, child: Center(child: Text("Item 2"))),
        Container(color: Colors.yellow, height: 100, child: Center(child: Text("Item 3"))),
      ],
      // Add more properties as needed
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple draggable home with a header and three draggable items.

# Complete Example of Draggable Home

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:draggable_home/draggable_home.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: DraggableHome(
        title: Text("Draggable Home Example"),
        headerWidget: Container(
          color: Colors.blue,
          height: 200,
          child: Center(child: Text("Header", style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24))),
        ),
        body: [
          // First draggable item
          Container(
            color: Colors.red,
            height: 100,
            child: Center(child: Text("Item 1")),
          ),
          // Second draggable item
          Container(
            color: Colors.green,
            height: 100,
            child: Center(child: Text("Item 2")),
          ),
          // Third draggable item
          Container(
            color: Colors.yellow,
            height: 100,
            child: Center(child: Text("Item 3")),
          ),
        ],
        // Optional: Add more properties as needed
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp containing a DraggableHome widget.
// 3. The DraggableHome widget has a title and a header widget that is displayed at the top.
// 4. The body of the DraggableHome consists of three draggable items, each represented by a Container with a different color.
// 5. Users can drag and drop these items to rearrange them on the home screen, providing a customizable experience.
```

In this complete example, we have created a simple Flutter application using the **draggable_home** package. The application consists of a header and three draggable items. The comments within the code explain the flow of the application step-by-step, making it easy to understand how the package works.

### Final Summary

The **draggable_home** package allows developers to create interactive and customizable home screens in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions provided in this blog, you can easily implement draggable functionality in your own projects, enhancing user engagement and experience.
