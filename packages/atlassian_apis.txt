# Overview of the `atlassian_apis` Flutter Package

The `atlassian_apis` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate interaction with Atlassian's suite of APIs, including Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket. This package allows developers to integrate Atlassian services into their Flutter applications seamlessly, enabling functionalities such as issue tracking, project management, and documentation management.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `atlassian_apis` package when:
- You are developing a Flutter application that requires integration with Atlassian products.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `atlassian_apis` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `atlassian_apis` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  atlassian_apis: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configuring for Android

For Android, ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application
        android:label="Your App"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        <activity
            android:name=".MainActivity"
            android:launchMode="singleTop">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
    </application>

    <!-- Add internet permission -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
</manifest>
```

## Step 3: Configuring for iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Hereâ€™s how to use the `atlassian_apis` package in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the Package**:
   ```dart
   import 'package:atlassian_apis/atlassian_apis.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize the API Client**:
   You can initialize the API client with your Atlassian credentials:
   ```dart
   final client = AtlassianClient(
       baseUrl: 'https://your-domain.atlassian.net',
       username: 'your-email@example.com',
       apiToken: 'your-api-token',
   );
   ```

3. **Making API Calls**:
   You can now make API calls, for example, to fetch Jira issues:
   ```dart
   final issues = await client.jira.getIssues();
   ```

4. **Handling Responses**:
   Make sure to handle responses and errors appropriately:
   ```dart
   if (issues.isNotEmpty) {
       // Process issues
   } else {
       // Handle error
   }
   ```

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the `atlassian_apis` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the `atlassian_apis` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:atlassian_apis/atlassian_apis.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Atlassian APIs Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late AtlassianClient client;
  List<Issue> issues = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Atlassian client with your credentials
    client = AtlassianClient(
      baseUrl: 'https://your-domain.atlassian.net',
      username: 'your-email@example.com',
      apiToken: 'your-api-token',
    );
    // Fetch Jira issues when the app starts
    fetchIssues();
  }

  Future<void> fetchIssues() async {
    try {
      // Fetch issues from Jira
      final fetchedIssues = await client.jira.getIssues();
      setState(() {
        issues = fetchedIssues; // Update the state with fetched issues
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the API call
      print('Error fetching issues: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Atlassian Issues'),
      ),
      body: issues.isEmpty
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator while fetching
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: issues.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                final issue = issues[index];
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(issue.title), // Display issue title
                  subtitle: Text(issue.description), // Display issue description
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is the home screen, where the Atlassian client is initialized.
// 3. In the initState method, the fetchIssues method is called to retrieve Jira issues.
// 4. The fetchIssues method makes an API call to get issues and updates the state.
// 5. The build method displays a loading indicator while issues are being fetched.
// 6. Once the issues are fetched, they are displayed in a ListView.
```
