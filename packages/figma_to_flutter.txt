```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:figma_to_flutter/figma_to_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the package
  FigmaToFlutter.init();

  // Convert the Figma design into Flutter code
  String flutterCode = FigmaToFlutter.convert('https://www.figma.com/file/your_design_url');

  // Create a new Flutter app
  runApp(MyApp(flutterCode));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final String flutterCode;

  MyApp(this.flutterCode);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Use the converted Flutter code to build the app
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Figma to Flutter Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Text(flutterCode),

    );
  }
}

// The following comments explain the flow of the application:

// 1. The user runs the app, which initializes the FigmaToFlutter package.
// 2. The package converts the Figma design into Flutter code using the convert method.
// 3. The converted Flutter code is passed to the MyApp widget.
// 4. The MyApp widget uses the converted Flutter code to build the app.
// 5. The app is displayed to the user.

// Summary: The code flows from the main function, where the FigmaToFlutter package is initialized, to the MyApp widget, where the converted Flutter code is used to build the app.
