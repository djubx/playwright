# Tutorial: Setting Up the Ringtone Player Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `ringtone_player` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ringtone_player: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your music library.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:ringtone_player/ringtone_player.dart';
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

You can now use the `RingtonePlayer` class to play ringtones. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
RingtonePlayer.play('ringtone.mp3'); // Replace with your ringtone file
```

This will play the specified ringtone. You can also pause and stop playback using:

```dart
RingtonePlayer.pause();
RingtonePlayer.stop();
```

With these steps, you are ready to integrate the `ringtone_player` package into your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Ringtone Player

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ringtone_player/ringtone_player.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ringtone Player Example',
      home: RingtonePlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class RingtonePlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RingtonePlayerScreenState createState() => _RingtonePlayerScreenState();
}

class _RingtonePlayerScreenState extends State<RingtonePlayerScreen> {
  bool isPlaying = false; // Track if the ringtone is currently playing

  // Function to play the ringtone
  void playRingtone() {
    RingtonePlayer.play('ringtone.mp3'); // Play the specified ringtone
    setState(() {
      isPlaying = true; // Update the state to indicate playing
    });
  }

  // Function to pause the ringtone
  void pauseRingtone() {
    RingtonePlayer.pause(); // Pause the ringtone
    setState(() {
      isPlaying = false; // Update the state to indicate paused
    });
  }

  // Function to stop the ringtone
  void stopRingtone() {
    RingtonePlayer.stop(); // Stop the ringtone
    setState(() {
      isPlaying = false; // Update the state to indicate stopped
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Ringtone Player'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              isPlaying ? 'Playing Ringtone' : 'Ringtone Stopped',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: isPlaying ? pauseRingtone : playRingtone,
              child: Text(isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: stopRingtone,
              child: Text('Stop'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The RingtonePlayerScreen widget manages the state of the ringtone playback.
// 4. The screen displays a message indicating whether the ringtone is playing or stopped.
// 5. The user can play, pause, or stop the ringtone using the provided buttons.
// 6. Each button updates the state and calls the appropriate method from the RingtonePlayer class.
