**Setting up intro_views_flutter**
================================

To use `intro_views_flutter` in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Add the `intro_views_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  intro_views_flutter: ^3.2.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the `intro_views_flutter` package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:intro_views_flutter/intro_views_flutter.dart';
```
**Creating an IntroView**
-------------------------

To create an `IntroView`, you need to create a list of `PageViewModel` objects, each representing a page in the intro tour:
```dart
List<PageViewModel> pages = [
  PageViewModel(
    pageColor: Colors.blue,
    body: Text('Page 1'),
  ),
  PageViewModel(
    pageColor: Colors.red,
    body: Text('Page 2'),
  ),
  PageViewModel(
    pageColor: Colors.green,
    body: Text('Page 3'),
  ),
];
```
**Using the IntroView**
----------------------

To use the `IntroView`, create a `MaterialApp` with a `home` property set to an `IntroView` widget:
```dart
MaterialApp(
  home: IntroView(
    pages: pages,
    onDone: () {
      // Callback when the intro tour is completed
    },
  ),
);
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:intro_views_flutter/intro_views_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a list of PageViewModel objects
    List<PageViewModel> pages = [
      PageViewModel(
        pageColor: Colors.blue,
        body: Text('Page 1'),
        // Add a gesture to navigate to the next page
        footer: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the next page
          },
          child: Text('Next'),
        ),
      ),
      PageViewModel(
        pageColor: Colors.red,
        body: Text('Page 2'),
        // Add a gesture to navigate to the previous page
        footer: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the previous page
          },
          child: Text('Previous'),
        ),
      ),
      PageViewModel(
        pageColor: Colors.green,
        body: Text('Page 3'),
        // Add a gesture to complete the intro tour
        footer: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Complete the intro tour
          },
          child: Text('Done'),
        ),
      ),
    ];

    // Create an IntroView widget
    return MaterialApp(
      home: IntroView(
        pages: pages,
        onDone: () {
          // Callback when the intro tour is completed
          print('Intro tour completed');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user launches the app and is presented with the first page of the intro tour.
// 2. The user can navigate to the next page by clicking the 'Next' button.
// 3. The user can navigate to the previous page by clicking the 'Previous' button.
// 4. The user can complete the intro tour by clicking the 'Done' button.
// 5. When the intro tour is completed, the callback function is called and a message is printed to the console.

// The above code demonstrates the usage of the IntroView widget and its various features.
// It also shows how to create a list of PageViewModel objects and use them to create an IntroView widget.
// The code also demonstrates how to add gestures to navigate between pages and complete the intro tour.
