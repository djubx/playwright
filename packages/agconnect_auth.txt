# Setting Up and Using agconnect_auth

## Installation
To use the `agconnect_auth` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  agconnect_auth: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/agconnect_auth).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Add Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following permissions:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Configure Huawei Services**: Ensure you have the Huawei services configured in your project. This includes adding the `agconnect-services.json` file to your `android/app` directory.

### iOS
1. **Add Permissions**: Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Configure Huawei Services**: Similar to Android, ensure you have the `agconnect-services.plist` file added to your iOS project.

## Basic Usage
To use the `agconnect_auth` package, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to authenticate a user:

```dart
import 'package:agconnect_auth/agconnect_auth.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await AGConnectAuth.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This code initializes the authentication service when the app starts. You can then use the `AGConnectAuth` class to manage user authentication.

# Complete Example of Using agconnect_auth

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:agconnect_auth/agconnect_auth.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure Flutter binding is initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize the AGConnectAuth service
  await AGConnectAuth.initialize();
  
  // Run the main application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AGConnect Auth Example',
      home: AuthScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class AuthScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AuthScreenState createState() => _AuthScreenState();
}

class _AuthScreenState extends State<AuthScreen> {
  String _status = 'Not logged in';

  // Method to handle user login
  void _login() async {
    try {
      // Create a sign-in request
      final result = await AGConnectAuth.getInstance().signInWithEmailAndPassword(
        email: 'user@example.com',
        password: 'password123',
      );

      // Update status on successful login
      setState(() {
        _status = 'Logged in as: ${result.user?.displayName}';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle login error
      setState(() {
        _status = 'Login failed: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('AGConnect Auth Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_status), // Display login status
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _login, // Trigger login on button press
              child: Text('Login'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing AGConnectAuth.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The AuthScreen widget is displayed, showing the current login status.
// 4. When the user presses the 'Login' button, the _login method is called.
// 5. The _login method attempts to sign in the user with the provided email and password.
// 6. If successful, the status is updated to show the user's display name; if it fails, an error message is displayed.
