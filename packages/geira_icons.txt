```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:geira_icons/geira_icons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Geira Icons Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Geira Icons Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Use the Geira Icons package to display an icon
              Icon(GeiraIcons.heart, size: 50),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Use the Geira Icons package to display another icon
              Icon(GeiraIcons.facebook, size: 50),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Use the Geira Icons package to display a third icon
              Icon(GeiraIcons.twitter, size: 50),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application.
// 2. The MaterialApp is built and displayed on the screen.
// 3. The Scaffold is used to define the basic material design layout structure.
// 4. The AppBar is used to display the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold is used to display the main content of the application.
// 6. The Center widget is used to center the content horizontally and vertically.
// 7. The Column widget is used to display a vertical list of children.
// 8. The Icon widgets are used to display the icons from the Geira Icons package.
// 9. The SizedBox widgets are used to add space between the icons.
```

// In summary, this code creates a basic Flutter application that displays a few icons from the Geira Icons package. The application uses the MaterialApp, Scaffold, AppBar, Center, Column, and Icon widgets to define the layout and display the icons. The SizedBox widgets are used to add space between the icons.
