   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure you have the correct deployment target set in your `ios/Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed and configured the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate a PayPal payment.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_paypal/flutter_paypal.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PayPal Payment Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Initiate PayPal payment
              PayPalPayment(
                clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
                secret: 'YOUR_SECRET',
                returnUrl: 'YOUR_RETURN_URL',
                cancelUrl: 'YOUR_CANCEL_URL',
                amount: '10.00',
                currency: 'USD',
                onSuccess: (response) {
                  // Handle successful payment
                  print('Payment successful: $response');
                },
                onError: (error) {

# Complete Example of Flutter PayPal Integration

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_paypal/flutter_paypal.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PayPal Payment Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Initiate PayPal payment
              PayPalPayment(
                clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID', // Your PayPal client ID
                secret: 'YOUR_SECRET', // Your PayPal secret
                returnUrl: 'YOUR_RETURN_URL', // URL to redirect after payment
                cancelUrl: 'YOUR_CANCEL_URL', // URL to redirect if payment is canceled
                amount: '10.00', // Amount to be charged
                currency: 'USD', // Currency type
                onSuccess: (response) {
                  // Handle successful payment
                  print('Payment successful: $response');
                },
                onError: (error) {
                  // Handle payment error
                  print('Payment error: $error');
                },
              ).startPayment(); // Start the payment process
            },
            child: Text('Pay with PayPal'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. A MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is displayed.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the PayPalPayment class is instantiated with necessary parameters.
// 5. The startPayment() method is called to initiate the payment process.
// 6. If the payment is successful, the onSuccess callback is triggered, printing the response.
// 7. If there is an error during the payment, the onError callback is triggered, printing the error message.
