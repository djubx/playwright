# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using LuckyWheel

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the LuckyWheel package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the LuckyWheel package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  luckywheel: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires them. However, the LuckyWheel package does not require any specific permissions.

## Step 3: Using LuckyWheel in Your Application

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple application that uses the LuckyWheel widget.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:luckywheel/luckywheel.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the wheel's state:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Define the wheel's segments and other properties
  List<String> segments = ['Prize 1', 'Prize 2', 'Prize 3', 'Prize 4'];
  double wheelRotation = 0.0;

  // Function to spin the wheel
  void spinWheel() {
    setState(() {
      wheelRotation = (wheelRotation + 360) % 360; // Rotate the wheel
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Lucky Wheel Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: LuckyWheel(
          segments: segments,
          rotation: wheelRotation,
          onSpinComplete: (selectedSegment) {
            // Handle the result of the spin
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('You won: $selectedSegment')),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: spinWheel,
        child: Icon(Icons.play_arrow),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Finally, run your application:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(home: RealFlutter()));
}
```

This code sets up a basic spinning wheel application where users can spin the wheel by pressing a button.

# Complete Example of LuckyWheel

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Import Flutter material package
import 'package:luckywheel/luckywheel.dart'; // Import LuckyWheel package

// Define the main widget
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

// State class for RealFlutter
class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Define the wheel's segments and other properties
  List<String> segments = ['Prize 1', 'Prize 2', 'Prize 3', 'Prize 4']; // List of prizes
  double wheelRotation = 0.0; // Initial rotation angle

  // Function to spin the wheel
  void spinWheel() {
    setState(() {
      wheelRotation = (wheelRotation + 360) % 360; // Rotate the wheel by 360 degrees
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Lucky Wheel Example')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: LuckyWheel(
          segments: segments, // Pass the segments to the wheel
          rotation: wheelRotation, // Set the current rotation
          onSpinComplete: (selectedSegment) {
            // Handle the result of the spin
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('You won: $selectedSegment')), // Show the result
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: spinWheel, // Spin the wheel when pressed
        child: Icon(Icons.play_arrow), // Play icon
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Main function to run the app
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(home: RealFlutter())); // Run the RealFlutter widget
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MaterialApp containing the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the spinning wheel.
3. The segments of the wheel are defined in a list, and the initial rotation angle is set to 0.
4. When the user presses the floating action button, the spinWheel function is called, which updates the rotation angle.
5. The LuckyWheel widget is rendered in the center of the screen, displaying the segments and the current rotation.
6. When the wheel stops spinning, the onSpinComplete callback is triggered, displaying a SnackBar with the result of the spin.
