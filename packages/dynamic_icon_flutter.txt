# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dynamic Icon Flutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `dynamic_icon_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dynamic_icon_flutter: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following lines within the `<application>` tag:

   ```xml
   <meta-data
       android:name="com.dynamic_icon_flutter.icon"
       android:resource="@drawable/ic_launcher" />
   ```

2. **Add Icon Resources**: Place your icon images in the `android/app/src/main/res` directory. You should have different sizes for different screen densities (e.g., `mipmap-mdpi`, `mipmap-hdpi`, etc.).

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key:

   ```xml
   <key>CFBundleIcons</key>
   <dict>
       <key>CFBundlePrimaryIcon</key>
       <dict>
           <key>CFBundleIconFiles</key>
           <array>
               <string>AppIcon</string>
           </array>
       </dict>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Add Icon Images**: Add your icon images to the `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` directory.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have configured the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to implement it in your main file.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dynamic_icon_flutter/dynamic_icon_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dynamic Icon Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the current icon name
  String currentIcon = 'icon1'; // Default icon

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dynamic Icon Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Current Icon: $currentIcon'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Change the icon to icon2
                setState(() {
                  currentIcon = 'icon2';
                });
                // Call the method to update the app icon
                DynamicIconFlutter.setIcon(currentIcon);
              },
              child: Text('Change to Icon 2'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Change the icon back to icon1
                setState(() {
                  currentIcon = 'icon1';
                });
                // Call the method to update the app icon
                DynamicIconFlutter.setIcon(currentIcon);
              },
              child: Text('Change to Icon 1'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a HomeScreen as its home.
// 3. The HomeScreen contains a stateful widget that manages the current icon state.
// 4. The current icon is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 5. Two buttons allow the user to change the app icon dynamically.
// 6. When a button is pressed, the current icon state is updated, and the app icon is changed using the DynamicIconFlutter.setIcon method.
```
