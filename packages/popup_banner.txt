# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Popup Banner Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `popup_banner` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  popup_banner: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your banner requires any specific permissions (like notifications). However, for basic usage, no additional configuration is required.

## Step 3: Using the Popup Banner

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `popup_banner` in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:popup_banner/popup_banner.dart'; // Import the popup_banner package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Popup Banner Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Popup Banner Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the popup banner when the button is pressed
            showPopupBanner(context);
          },
          child: Text('Show Popup Banner'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showPopupBanner(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a PopupBanner instance
    PopupBanner(
      title: 'Hello!',
      message: 'This is a customizable popup banner.',
      backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
      textColor: Colors.white,
      duration: Duration(seconds: 3), // Duration for which the banner will be visible
      onDismiss: () {
        // Action to perform when the banner is dismissed
        print('Banner dismissed');
      },
    ).show(context); // Show the banner
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (HomeScreen).
// 3. HomeScreen contains a button that, when pressed, triggers the showPopupBanner function.
// 4. The showPopupBanner function creates a PopupBanner instance with a title, message, and customization options.
// 5. The banner is displayed at the top of the screen for 3 seconds and can be dismissed by the user.
// 6. When the banner is dismissed, a message is printed to the console.
