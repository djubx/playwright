# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutterflow_paginate_firestore

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutterflow_paginate_firestore` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutterflow_paginate_firestore` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutterflow_paginate_firestore: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutterflow_paginate_firestore).

## Step 2: Configure Firestore

Ensure that your Flutter app is configured to use Firebase. Follow these steps:

### For Android:
1. Add the `google-services.json` file to your `android/app` directory.
2. Update your `android/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10' // Check for the latest version
    }
}
```

3. Update your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

### For iOS:
1. Add the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to your iOS project.
2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` file.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, letâ€™s create a simple application that uses `flutterflow_paginate_firestore` to display a list of items from Firestore.

### Example Code

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutterflow_paginate_firestore/flutterflow_paginate_firestore.dart';
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Paginate Firestore Example')),
        body: PaginateFirestore(
          itemBuilder: (context, documentSnapshot, index) {
            // Build your item widget here
            return ListTile(
              title: Text(documentSnapshot['title']),
              subtitle: Text(documentSnapshot['description']),
            );
          },
          query: FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('items').orderBy('createdAt'),
          itemsPerPage: 10, // Number of items to load per page
          isLive: true, // Set to true for real-time updates
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **MaterialApp**: The main widget that wraps the entire application.
- **PaginateFirestore**: The widget that handles pagination. It takes a query and an item builder.
- **itemBuilder**: A function that builds the UI for each item in the list.
- **query**: A Firestore query that specifies which documents to fetch.
- **itemsPerPage**: Defines how many items to load at once.
- **isLive**: If set to true, the list will update in real-time as data changes in Firestore.

# Complete Example of flutterflow_paginate_firestore

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutterflow_paginate_firestore/flutterflow_paginate_firestore.dart';
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Paginate Firestore Example')),
        body: PaginateFirestore(
          itemBuilder: (context, documentSnapshot, index) {
            // Build your item widget here
            return ListTile(
              title: Text(documentSnapshot['title']),
              subtitle: Text(documentSnapshot['description']),
            );
          },
          query: FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('items').orderBy('createdAt'),
          itemsPerPage: 10, // Number of items to load per page
          isLive: true, // Set to true for real-time updates
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains the PaginateFirestore widget.
// 5. The PaginateFirestore widget takes a query to fetch documents from the 'items' collection.
// 6. The itemBuilder function is called for each document fetched, creating a ListTile for each item.
// 7. The itemsPerPage property controls how many items are loaded at once, and isLive enables real-time updates.
// 8. As users scroll, more items are fetched automatically, providing a seamless experience.
