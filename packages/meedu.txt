# Meedu Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Meedu package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  meedu: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/meedu).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file to allow media playback:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a video player using Meedu.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:meedu/meedu.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Meedu Video Player')),
        body: Center(
          child: MeeduPlayer(
            url: 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // Replace with your video URL
            autoPlay: true,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple video player that automatically plays a video from a specified URL. The `MeeduPlayer` widget handles all the playback functionalities for us.

With these steps, you are now ready to implement the Meedu package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Meedu in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:meedu/meedu.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Meedu Video Player')),
        body: Center(
          // The MeeduPlayer widget is used to display the video player
          child: MeeduPlayer(
            url: 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // URL of the video to be played
            autoPlay: true, // Automatically play the video on load
            // Additional configurations can be added here
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title "Meedu Video Player".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The child of the Center widget is the MeeduPlayer, which takes a video URL and an autoPlay parameter.
// 6. When the app runs, the MeeduPlayer initializes and starts playing the video automatically.
// 7. The player provides built-in controls for the user to interact with the video playback.
