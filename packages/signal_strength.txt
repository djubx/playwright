**Signal Strength Flutter Package**
=====================================

The `signal_strength` Flutter package provides a simple and efficient way to retrieve the signal strength of the device's cellular network. This package is useful for applications that require knowledge of the device's network signal strength, such as network monitoring tools or applications that need to optimize their behavior based on the network conditions.

**When to Use This Package**
---------------------------

You can use this package in the following scenarios:

*   Network monitoring tools: to display the current signal strength of the device.
*   Applications that require network optimization: to adjust the application's behavior based on the network signal strength.
*   Research and development: to collect data on network signal strength for research purposes.

**Features**
------------

*   Retrieves the signal strength of the device's cellular network.
*   Supports both Android and iOS platforms.
*   Provides a simple and easy-to-use API.

**Setup and Usage**
-------------------

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the `signal_strength` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  signal_strength: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the `signal_strength` package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:signal_strength/signal_strength.dart';
```

### Step 3: Use the Package

Use the `SignalStrength` class to retrieve the signal strength of the device's cellular network:

```dart
SignalStrength signalStrength = SignalStrength();
int signalStrengthValue = await signalStrength.getSignalStrength();
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

On Android, the `signal_strength` package uses the `TelephonyManager` class to retrieve the signal strength of the device's cellular network. This requires the `READ_PHONE_STATE` permission, which is added automatically by the package.

#### iOS

On iOS, the `signal_strength` package uses the `CTTelephonyNetworkInfo` class to retrieve the signal strength of the device's cellular network. This requires the `NSCTCellularData` permission, which is added automatically by the package.

### Configurations and Optimizations

You can configure the `signal_strength` package to suit your needs. For example, you can set the interval at which the signal strength is updated:

```dart
SignalStrength signalStrength = SignalStrength(updateInterval: 1000); // Update every 1 second
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:signal_strength/signal_strength.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Signal Strength Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  int _signalStrengthValue = 0;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _updateSignalStrength();
  }

  Future<void> _updateSignalStrength() async {
    // Create a new instance of the SignalStrength class
    SignalStrength signalStrength = SignalStrength();

    // Get the signal strength value
    int signalStrengthValue = await signalStrength.getSignalStrength();

    // Update the UI with the new signal strength value
    setState(() {
      _signalStrengthValue = signalStrengthValue;
    });

    // Update the signal strength every 1 second
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), _updateSignalStrength);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Signal Strength Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Signal Strength: $_signalStrengthValue',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The MyApp widget is created and run.
// 2. The MyHomePage widget is created and displayed.
// 3. The _updateSignalStrength method is called to update the signal strength value.
// 4. The SignalStrength class is used to get the signal strength value.
// 5. The UI is updated with the new signal strength value.
// 6. The signal strength value is updated every 1 second using the Future.delayed method.
```
