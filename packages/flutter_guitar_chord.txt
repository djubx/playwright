        chord: 'C', // Specify the chord you want to display
        size: 200, // Size of the chord display

# Complete Example of Flutter Guitar Chord Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_guitar_chord/flutter_guitar_chord.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Guitar Chord App',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: ChordDisplayScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ChordDisplayScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Guitar Chord Display')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Displaying a C chord
            GuitarChord(
              chord: 'C', // The chord to display
              size: 200, // Size of the chord display
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between chords
            // Displaying a G chord
            GuitarChord(
              chord: 'G', // The chord to display
              size: 200, // Size of the chord display
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between chords
            // Displaying an E minor chord
            GuitarChord(
              chord: 'Em', // The chord to display
              size: 200, // Size of the chord display
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to ChordDisplayScreen, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. ChordDisplayScreen builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to stack multiple GuitarChord widgets vertically.
// 6. Each GuitarChord widget displays a different chord (C, G, Em) with a specified size.
// 7. SizedBox is used to add spacing between the chord displays for better visual separation.
