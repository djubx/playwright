# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Marquee Widget

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the `marquee_widget`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  marquee_widget: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Marquee Widget
Now that you have set up the package, you can use the `Marquee` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:marquee_widget/marquee_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Marquee Widget Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Marquee(
            text: 'Welcome to the Marquee Widget Demo! Enjoy scrolling text!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            scrollAxis: Axis.horizontal, // Scroll horizontally
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
            blankSpace: 20.0, // Space between the end of the text and the start of the next loop
            velocity: 100.0, // Speed of the scrolling text
            pauseAfterRound: Duration(seconds: 1), // Pause after each round
            startPadding: 10.0, // Padding at the start
            accelerationDuration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Duration for acceleration
            accelerationCurve: Curves.easeIn, // Curve for acceleration
            decelerationDuration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Duration for deceleration
            decelerationCurve: Curves.easeOut, // Curve for deceleration
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Marquee Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:marquee_widget/marquee_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Marquee Widget Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Marquee(
            text: 'Welcome to the Marquee Widget Demo! Enjoy scrolling text!', // Text to be displayed
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold), // Styling the text
            scrollAxis: Axis.horizontal, // Setting the scroll direction to horizontal
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start, // Aligning the text to the start
            blankSpace: 20.0, // Space between the end of the text and the start of the next loop
            velocity: 100.0, // Speed of the scrolling text
            pauseAfterRound: Duration(seconds: 1), // Pause after each round
            startPadding: 10.0, // Padding at the start
            accelerationDuration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Duration for acceleration
            accelerationCurve: Curves.easeIn, // Curve for acceleration
            decelerationDuration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Duration for deceleration
            decelerationCurve: Curves.easeOut, // Curve for deceleration
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. The Marquee widget is used to display scrolling text with various customizable properties.
// 7. The text scrolls horizontally with a specified speed and pauses after each round, creating a dynamic effect.
```
