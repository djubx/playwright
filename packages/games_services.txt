# Tutorial: Setting Up the Games Services Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `games_services` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  games_services: ^0.14.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <!-- Add this inside the <application> tag -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.gms.games.APP_ID"
            android:value="@string/app_id" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Add App ID**: Create a `res/values/strings.xml` file if it doesn't exist and add your Google Play Games App ID:

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="app_id">YOUR_APP_ID</string>
</resources>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save game screenshots.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for in-game features.</string>
```

2. **Enable Game Center**: In your Xcode project, go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab and enable "Game Center".

## Step 3: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, initialize the `games_services` package:

```dart
import 'package:games_services/games_services.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await GamesServices.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to manage achievements and leaderboards. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to report an achievement:

```dart
void reportAchievement(String achievementId) async {
  await GamesServices.reportAchievement(achievementId);
}
```

This function can be called whenever a player completes an achievement in your game.

# Complete Example of Using Games Services

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:games_services/games_services.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure Flutter bindings are initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize the Games Services
  await GamesServices.initialize();
  
  // Run the main application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Games Services Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Example achievement ID
  final String achievementId = 'YOUR_ACHIEVEMENT_ID';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load achievements when the screen is initialized
    loadAchievements();
  }

  // Function to load achievements
  void loadAchievements() async {
    // Fetch achievements from the Games Services
    final achievements = await GamesServices.listAchievements();
    // Handle the achievements (e.g., display them)
    print(achievements);
  }

  // Function to report an achievement
  void reportAchievement() async {
    // Report the achievement to the Games Services
    await GamesServices.reportAchievement(achievementId);
    // Show a confirmation message
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(content: Text('Achievement reported!')),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Games Services Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: reportAchievement,
          child: Text('Complete Achievement'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing the Games Services in the main function.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, which loads achievements in its initState.
// 3. When the user presses the "Complete Achievement" button, the reportAchievement function is called.
// 4. This function reports the achievement to the Games Services and shows a confirmation message.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, the application initializes the `games_services` package and provides a simple interface for reporting achievements. The flow of the application is straightforward: it initializes the service, loads achievements, and allows users to report an achievement with a button click. 

### Summary of Application Flow
- The app initializes the `games_services` package.
- Achievements are loaded when the HomeScreen is initialized.
- Users can report an achievement by pressing a button, which triggers the `reportAchievement` function.
- A confirmation message is displayed upon successfully reporting the achievement.

This structure provides a comprehensive overview, setup guide, and practical example of using the `games_services` Flutter package, making it easier for developers to integrate gaming features into their applications.
