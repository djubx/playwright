# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Sidebar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **animated_sidebar** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **animated_sidebar** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_sidebar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Animated Sidebar
Now that we have set up the package, let’s create a simple application that utilizes the animated sidebar.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:animated_sidebar/animated_sidebar.dart';
```

2. Create a StatefulWidget that will manage the sidebar state.

3. Use the `AnimatedSidebar` widget in your build method.

Here’s a simple example of how to implement the animated sidebar in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_sidebar/animated_sidebar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to track the sidebar state
  bool _isSidebarOpen = false;

  // Function to toggle the sidebar
  void _toggleSidebar() {
    setState(() {
      _isSidebarOpen = !_isSidebarOpen; // Toggle the sidebar state
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Sidebar Example'),
          leading: IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.menu), // Menu icon to toggle sidebar
            onPressed: _toggleSidebar, // Call toggle function
          ),
        ),
        body: Row(
          children: [
            // Animated Sidebar
            AnimatedSidebar(
              isOpen: _isSidebarOpen, // Pass the sidebar state
              items: [
                SidebarItem(icon: Icons.home, title: 'Home'), // Sidebar items
                SidebarItem(icon: Icons.settings, title: 'Settings'),
                SidebarItem(icon: Icons.info, title: 'About'),
              ],
              onItemSelected: (index) {
                // Handle item selection
                print('Selected item: $index');
                _toggleSidebar(); // Close sidebar after selection
              },
            ),
            // Main content area
            Expanded(
              child: Center(
                child: Text('Main Content Area'), // Placeholder for main content
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the sidebar (open or closed).
// 3. The _toggleSidebar function is defined to change the state of the sidebar when called.
// 4. The build method creates a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Row.
// 5. The Row contains the AnimatedSidebar and an Expanded widget for the main content area.
// 6. The AnimatedSidebar takes the current state (_isSidebarOpen) and a list of SidebarItems.
// 7. When an item is selected, it prints the index of the selected item and closes the sidebar.
// 8. The main content area is a simple Text widget that can be replaced with actual content.
```
