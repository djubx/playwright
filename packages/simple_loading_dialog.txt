# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Loading Dialog

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `simple_loading_dialog` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_loading_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the loading dialog, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:simple_loading_dialog/simple_loading_dialog.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Loading Dialog

You can now use the loading dialog in your application. Here’s how to do it:

### For Android

Ensure that your Android project is set up to support the necessary permissions and configurations. Typically, no additional setup is required for using the loading dialog.

### For iOS

For iOS, make sure your `Info.plist` file includes any necessary configurations, although the `simple_loading_dialog` package does not require specific permissions.

## Example Usage

Here’s a simple example of how to use the loading dialog in your Flutter application:

```dart
void showLoadingDialog(BuildContext context) {
  showDialog(
    context: context,
    builder: (BuildContext context) {
      return SimpleLoadingDialog(
        message: 'Loading, please wait...',
      );
    },
  );
}
```

You can call `showLoadingDialog(context)` before starting an asynchronous task and dismiss it once the task is complete.

## Dismissing the Dialog

To dismiss the dialog, you can use:

```dart
Navigator.of(context).pop();
```

This will close the loading dialog when your task is finished.

With these steps, you can easily integrate and use the `simple_loading_dialog` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Simple Loading Dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_loading_dialog/simple_loading_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Loading Dialog Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Loading Dialog Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Show the loading dialog when the button is pressed
            showLoadingDialog(context);
            // Simulate a network request or long-running task
            await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));
            // Dismiss the loading dialog after the task is complete
            Navigator.of(context).pop();
            // Show a success message
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Task Completed!')),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Start Task'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains a button that, when pressed, triggers an asynchronous task.
// 4. Upon pressing the button, the loading dialog is displayed using showLoadingDialog(context).
// 5. A simulated delay of 3 seconds is introduced to mimic a long-running task.
// 6. After the delay, the loading dialog is dismissed using Navigator.of(context).pop().
// 7. Finally, a SnackBar is shown to inform the user that the task has been completed.
