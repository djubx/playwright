# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Banners Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the banners package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  banners: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for any necessary permissions, especially if your banners include images or external links.

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Banners Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a banner.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:banners/banners.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: BannerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class BannerExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Banners Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Banner(
          message: 'New Feature Available!',
          location: BannerLocation.topStart,
          child: Container(
            height: 200,
            width: 300,
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the App!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple banner that displays a message at the top start of the screen. The `Banner` widget wraps around a container that represents the main content of the app.

# Complete Example of the Banners Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:banners/banners.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Banners Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: BannerExample(),
    );
  }
}

// Example widget demonstrating the use of banners
class BannerExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Banners Example')),
      body: Center(
        // Using the Banner widget to display a message
        child: Banner(
          message: 'New Feature Available!', // Message to display
          location: BannerLocation.topStart, // Position of the banner
          child: Container(
            height: 200, // Height of the main content
            width: 300, // Width of the main content
            color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the content
            child: Center(
              // Centering the text within the container
              child: Text(
                'Welcome to the App!', // Main content text
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20), // Text style
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, setting BannerExample as the home widget.
3. BannerExample creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered Banner widget.
4. The Banner widget displays a message at the top start of the screen.
5. The child of the Banner is a Container that holds the main content, styled with a blue background and centered text.
6. When the app runs, users will see the banner message and the welcome text, enhancing user engagement.
