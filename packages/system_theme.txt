# Overview of the `system_theme` Flutter Package

The `system_theme` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers easily access and apply the system's theme settings within their Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful when you want your app to seamlessly integrate with the user's device settings, providing a consistent look and feel that aligns with the overall system theme.

## When to Use `system_theme`

- **Consistency**: When you want your app to match the system's light or dark mode settings automatically.
- **User Experience**: To enhance user experience by respecting their system preferences.
- **Customization**: When you need to access system-specific theme details like accent colors.

## Features

- **Theme Detection**: Automatically detects whether the system is in light or dark mode.
- **Accent Color Access**: Retrieves the system's accent color for a more integrated UI.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `system_theme`

In this section, we'll walk through the setup process for the `system_theme` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `system_theme` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     system_theme: ^0.1.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package to start using it.

   ```dart
   import 'package:system_theme/system_theme.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support all features of the package.

  ```gradle
  android {
      defaultConfig {
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

### iOS

- No additional setup is required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`.

  ```ruby
  platform :ios, '9.0'
  ```

## Using the Package

- **Initialize SystemTheme**: Before using the package, initialize it in your `main` function.

  ```dart
  void main() async {
    WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
    await SystemTheme.accentColor.load();
    runApp(MyApp());
  }
  ```

- **Access Theme Data**: Use `SystemTheme` to access theme data like the accent color.

  ```dart
  Color accentColor = SystemTheme.accentColor.accent;
  ```

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

Below is a complete example demonstrating how to use the `system_theme` package in a Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:system_theme/system_theme.dart';

// Main function to initialize the app
void main() async {
  // Ensures that widget binding is initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Loads the system accent color
  await SystemTheme.accentColor.load();
  // Runs the app
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Retrieves the system's accent color
    Color accentColor = SystemTheme.accentColor.accent;

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'System Theme Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        // Applies the system's accent color to the app theme
        primaryColor: accentColor,
        brightness: SystemTheme.isDarkMode ? Brightness.dark : Brightness.light,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Welcome to RealFlutter!',
          style: TextStyle(
            // Uses the system's accent color for text
            color: SystemTheme.accentColor.accent,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The `main` function initializes the system theme and runs the app.
// `RealFlutter` is the main widget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// The app theme is configured to use the system's accent color and brightness.
// `HomeScreen` is a simple widget displaying a welcome message with the system's accent color.

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app initializes by loading the system's accent color.
// 2. `RealFlutter` sets up the MaterialApp with the system's theme settings.
// 3. The `HomeScreen` widget displays a centered text using the system's accent color.
// 4. The app dynamically adjusts its theme based on the system's light or dark mode settings.
