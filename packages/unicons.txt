# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Unicons in Flutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the Unicons package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  unicons: ^0.1.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the Unicons package:

```dart
import 'package:unicons/unicons.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Unicons in Your Application

You can now use Unicons in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s how to use an icon:

```dart
Icon(
  UniconsLine.home, // Replace with the desired icon
  size: 30.0, // Set the size of the icon
  color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the icon
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for icon rendering. Ensure you have the following permissions if you are using any features that require them:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select icons.</string>
```

## Step 4: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons further by wrapping them in a `Container` or using `IconButton` for interactive elements:

```dart
IconButton(
  icon: Icon(UniconsLine.user),
  iconSize: 40.0,
  color: Colors.green,
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
)
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate and use the Unicons package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using Unicons in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:unicons/unicons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Unicons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Unicons Flutter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a home icon
              Icon(
                UniconsLine.home,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a user icon
              Icon(
                UniconsLine.user,
                size: 50.0,
                color: Colors.green,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Displaying an icon button
              IconButton(
                icon: Icon(UniconsLine.cog),
                iconSize: 50.0,
                color: Colors.red,
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action when the icon button is pressed
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Settings Icon Pressed')),
                  );
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 5. Three icons are displayed: a home icon, a user icon, and a settings icon button.
// 6. The settings icon button has an onPressed callback that shows a SnackBar when pressed.
// 7. The app is structured to be simple and demonstrates the use of Unicons effectively.
