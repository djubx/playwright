# Flutter Foreground Task Package

The `flutter_foreground_task` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers who need to run tasks in the foreground while ensuring that the application remains responsive and user-friendly. This package is particularly useful for applications that require continuous background processing, such as location tracking, music playback, or any long-running tasks that need to be executed even when the app is not in the foreground.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_foreground_task` package in scenarios such as:

- **Location Tracking**: Apps that need to track user location continuously, even when the app is not actively being used.
- **Music or Media Playback**: Applications that play audio or video content in the background.
- **Data Syncing**: Apps that need to sync data with a server while the user is interacting with other applications.

## Features

- **Foreground Service**: Allows you to run a service in the foreground, ensuring that it is less likely to be killed by the system.
- **Task Management**: Provides an easy way to manage tasks, including starting, stopping, and updating tasks.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS, with platform-specific configurations.
- **Notifications**: Automatically handles notifications for foreground tasks, keeping users informed about ongoing processes.

This package is essential for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with robust background processing capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_foreground_task

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_foreground_task` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_foreground_task` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_foreground_task: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following permissions and service declaration:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>

<application>
    ...
    <service
        android:name="com.ekn.foreground_service.ForegroundService"
        android:permission="android.permission.BIND_JOB_SERVICE"
        android:exported="true"/>
</application>
```

2. **Enable Background Location**: If your app requires location tracking, ensure that you have the necessary permissions and settings for background location access.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following keys to request permission for location access:

```xml
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
```

2. **Background Modes**: Enable background modes in your Xcode project settings. Check the "Location updates" option under Background Modes.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have configured the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement a foreground task.

# Complete Example of Using flutter_foreground_task

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_foreground_task/flutter_foreground_task.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Foreground Task Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Method to start the foreground task
  void startForegroundTask() {
    FlutterForegroundTask.startService(
      notificationTitle: "Foreground Task Running",
      notificationText: "Your task is running in the background.",
      callback: taskCallback,
    );
  }

  // Method to stop the foreground task
  void stopForegroundTask() {
    FlutterForegroundTask.stopService();
  }

  // Callback function for the foreground task
  static void taskCallback() {
    // This function will be called when the foreground task is running
    FlutterForegroundTask.onStarted.listen((event) {
      // Perform your background task here
      print("Foreground task is running");
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Foreground Task Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: startForegroundTask,
              child: Text('Start Foreground Task'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: stopForegroundTask,
              child: Text('Stop Foreground Task'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, containing two buttons to start and stop the foreground task.
// 3. When the "Start Foreground Task" button is pressed, the startForegroundTask method is called.
// 4. This method starts the foreground service and displays a notification to the user.
// 5. The taskCallback function is registered to handle the background task logic.
// 6. When the "Stop Foreground Task" button is pressed, the stopForegroundTask method is called, stopping the service.
