# Flutter Blue Classic: A Comprehensive Guide

## Overview
The `flutter_blue_classic` package is a Flutter plugin that provides a simple way to interact with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. It allows developers to scan for, connect to, and communicate with BLE peripherals. This package is particularly useful for applications that require data exchange with smart devices, such as fitness trackers, smart home devices, and medical equipment.

### When to Use
You should consider using `flutter_blue_classic` when:
- You need to connect to BLE devices for data exchange.
- Your application requires real-time data from sensors or peripherals.
- You want to create a mobile app that interacts with IoT devices.

### Features
- **Scanning for Devices**: Discover nearby BLE devices.
- **Connecting to Devices**: Establish a connection with a selected BLE device.
- **Reading and Writing Characteristics**: Interact with the device's services and characteristics.
- **Listening for Notifications**: Receive real-time updates from the connected device.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for quick setup and usage.
- **Active Community**: Regular updates and community support.

## Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_blue_classic

### Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `flutter_blue_classic` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_blue_classic: ^0.8.0  # Check for the latest version
```

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android
1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
```

2. **Bluetooth Version**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses Bluetooth to connect to devices.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses Bluetooth to connect to peripherals.</string>
```

### Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to scan for devices and connect to one.

## Complete Example: RealFlutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_blue_classic/flutter_blue_classic.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Blue Classic Example',
      home: BluetoothPage(),
    );
  }
}

class BluetoothPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BluetoothPageState createState() => _BluetoothPageState();
}

class _BluetoothPageState extends State<BluetoothPage> {
  FlutterBlueClassic flutterBlue = FlutterBlueClassic.instance; // Instance of FlutterBlueClassic
  List<BluetoothDevice> devicesList = []; // List to hold discovered devices
  BluetoothDevice? connectedDevice; // Currently connected device

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    startScan(); // Start scanning for devices when the page initializes
  }

  void startScan() {
    // Start scanning for BLE devices
    flutterBlue.startScan(timeout: Duration(seconds: 4)); // Scan for 4 seconds

    // Listen for scan results
    flutterBlue.scanResults.listen((results) {
      // Update the devices list with discovered devices
      setState(() {
        devicesList = results.map((r) => r.device).toList();
      });
    });
  }

  void connectToDevice(BluetoothDevice device) async {
    // Stop scanning when a device is selected
    flutterBlue.stopScan();
    // Connect to the selected device
    await device.connect();
    setState(() {
      connectedDevice = device; // Update the connected device
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Bluetooth Devices'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: devicesList.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(devicesList[index].name.isEmpty
                      ? 'Unknown Device'
                      : devicesList[index].name), // Display device name
                  onTap: () => connectToDevice(devicesList[index]), // Connect on tap
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
          if (connectedDevice != null) // Show connected device info
            Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
              child: Text('Connected to: ${connectedDevice!.name}'),
            ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Disconnect the device when the page is disposed
    if (connectedDevice != null) {
      connectedDevice!.disconnect();
    }
    super.dispose();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a BluetoothPage as its home.
// 3. In the BluetoothPage, the initState method starts scanning for BLE devices.
// 4. The scan results are listened to, and the devicesList is updated with discovered devices.
// 5. The ListView displays the list of devices, and tapping on a device connects to it.
// 6. Once connected, the app displays the name of the connected device.
// 7. When the page is disposed, the connected device is disconnected to free resources.
```
