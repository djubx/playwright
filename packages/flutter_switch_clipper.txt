# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_switch_clipper`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_switch_clipper` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_switch_clipper` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_switch_clipper: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a toggle switch using `flutter_switch_clipper`.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_switch_clipper/flutter_switch_clipper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // State variable to hold the switch's current value
  bool _isSwitched = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Switch Clipper Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display the current state of the switch
              Text(
                _isSwitched ? 'Switch is ON' : 'Switch is OFF',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Implementing the flutter_switch_clipper
              FlutterSwitchClipper(
                value: _isSwitched, // Current state of the switch
                onToggle: (val) {
                  // Update the state when the switch is toggled
                  setState(() {
                    _isSwitched = val;
                  });
                },
                // Customizing the switch appearance
                activeColor: Colors.green,
                inactiveColor: Colors.red,
                width: 100.0, // Width of the switch
                height: 50.0, // Height of the switch
                clipper: RoundedRectangleBorder(
                  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(30.0), // Rounded corners
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the switch.
// 3. The _isSwitched variable holds the current state of the switch (ON/OFF).
// 4. The build method constructs the UI, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column displays the current state of the switch and the switch itself.
// 6. The FlutterSwitchClipper widget is used to create the toggle switch, with properties for value, onToggle callback, and appearance customization.
// 7. When the switch is toggled, the onToggle callback updates the _isSwitched state, causing the UI to rebuild and reflect the new state.
