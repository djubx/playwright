# File Sizes Flutter Package

The **file_sizes** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers easily manage and retrieve file sizes in their Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful when dealing with file uploads, downloads, or any scenario where file size information is crucial for user experience or application logic.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the **file_sizes** package in scenarios such as:
- **File Uploads**: To inform users about the size of files they are uploading, helping them understand potential data usage.
- **File Downloads**: To display the size of files before downloading, allowing users to make informed decisions.
- **Storage Management**: To monitor and manage storage space within the app, especially for apps that handle large media files.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick setup and usage.
- **File Size Retrieval**: Provides methods to get the size of files in various formats (bytes, kilobytes, megabytes).
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling for scenarios where file access might fail.

Overall, the **file_sizes** package enhances the user experience by providing essential file size information in a straightforward manner.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the File Sizes Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **file_sizes** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  file_sizes: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to read and write files. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to retrieve file sizes.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to retrieve file sizes.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve and display file sizes.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:file_sizes/file_sizes.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('File Sizes Example')),
        body: FileSizeWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class FileSizeWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FileSizeWidgetState createState() => _FileSizeWidgetState();
}

class _FileSizeWidgetState extends State<FileSizeWidget> {
  String _fileSize = 'Unknown';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getFileSize();
  }

  Future<void> _getFileSize() async {
    // Replace with your file path
    String filePath = '/path/to/your/file.txt';
    try {
      // Get the file size using the file_sizes package
      int size = await FileSizes.getFileSize(filePath);
      setState(() {
        _fileSize = FileSizes.formatSize(size); // Format the size for display
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _fileSize = 'Error: $e'; // Handle any errors
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text('File Size: $_fileSize'),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using the File Sizes Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:file_sizes/file_sizes.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('File Sizes Example')),
        body: FileSizeWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class FileSizeWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FileSizeWidgetState createState() => _FileSizeWidgetState();
}

class _FileSizeWidgetState extends State<FileSizeWidget> {
  String _fileSize = 'Unknown'; // Variable to hold the file size

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getFileSize(); // Call the method to get file size when the widget initializes
  }

  Future<void> _getFileSize() async {
    // Replace with your file path
    String filePath = '/path/to/your/file.txt'; // Specify the file path
    try {
      // Get the file size using the file_sizes package
      int size = await FileSizes.getFileSize(filePath); // Asynchronously get the file size
      setState(() {
        _fileSize = FileSizes.formatSize(size); // Format the size for display
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _fileSize = 'Error: $e'; // Handle any errors that occur
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text('File Size: $_fileSize'), // Display the file size
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 2. The FileSizeWidget is created, which is a StatefulWidget that manages its own state.
// 3. In the initState method, _getFileSize is called to retrieve the file size when the widget is initialized.
// 4. The _getFileSize method attempts to get the file size from the specified file path.
// 5. If successful, the file size is formatted and displayed; if an error occurs, an error message is shown.
// 6. The file size is displayed in the center of the screen.
