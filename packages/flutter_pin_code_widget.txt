Here's a detailed technical blog on the `flutter_pin_code_widget` Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Flutter Pin Code Widget

The `flutter_pin_code_widget` package is a versatile and customizable widget for creating PIN code input fields in Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require secure user authentication, such as banking apps, secure messaging platforms, or any app that needs to verify user identity through a PIN.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_pin_code_widget` package when:
- You need a secure way for users to input a PIN.
- You want to enhance user experience with a visually appealing and customizable PIN input interface.
- You require features like auto-focus, error handling, and customizable styles.

## Features

- **Customizable UI**: Easily change the appearance of the PIN input fields to match your app's theme.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in support for displaying error messages and handling incorrect PIN entries.
- **Auto-Focus**: Automatically focuses on the next input field after a digit is entered.
- **Support for Different Lengths**: Easily configure the length of the PIN code.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

With these features, the `flutter_pin_code_widget` package provides a robust solution for implementing PIN code inputs in your Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_pin_code_widget

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_pin_code_widget` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_pin_code_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include any necessary permissions, although the `flutter_pin_code_widget` does not require special permissions.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `flutter_pin_code_widget` in your app.

# Complete Example of flutter_pin_code_widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pin_code_widget/flutter_pin_code_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Pin Code Widget Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: PinCodeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PinCodeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PinCodeScreenState createState() => _PinCodeScreenState();
}

class _PinCodeScreenState extends State<PinCodeScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the entered PIN
  String pinCode = '';
  // Length of the PIN code
  final int pinLength = 4;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Enter Your PIN'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the PIN code input widget
            PinCodeWidget(
              length: pinLength, // Set the length of the PIN
              onChanged: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  pinCode = value; // Update the PIN code as the user types
                });
              },
              onCompleted: (value) {
                // Action to take when the PIN is completed
                _verifyPin(value);
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the current PIN code
            Text('Current PIN: $pinCode'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to verify the entered PIN
  void _verifyPin(String value) {
    // Here you can add your verification logic
    if (value == '1234') {
      // If the PIN is correct
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('PIN Verified!')),
      );
    } else {
      // If the PIN is incorrect
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Incorrect PIN!')),
      );
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home screen as PinCodeScreen.
// 3. In the PinCodeScreen, a stateful widget is created to manage the PIN input.
// 4. The PinCodeWidget is displayed, allowing the user to enter a PIN of specified length.
// 5. As the user types, the entered PIN is updated in the state.
// 6. When the user completes the PIN entry, the _verifyPin function is called to check the entered PIN.
// 7. If the PIN matches the expected value ('1234'), a success message is shown; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
