# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using csc_picker

## Step 1: Adding Dependency
To get started, add the `csc_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  csc_picker: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:csc_picker/csc_picker.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
You can use the `CscPicker` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
CscPicker(
  onCountryChanged: (value) {
    // Handle country change
  },
  onStateChanged: (value) {
    // Handle state change
  },
  onCityChanged: (value) {
    // Handle city change
  },
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customization
You can customize the appearance of the picker by using various properties:

```dart
CscPicker(
  showCountryFlag: true,
  dropdownDecoration: BoxDecoration(
    border: Border.all(color: Colors.blue),
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
  ),
  ...
)
```

## Step 5: Testing
Run your application on both Android and iOS devices to ensure that the picker works as expected and that the UI is responsive.

# Complete Example of csc_picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:csc_picker/csc_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'CSC Picker Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Country, State, City Picker'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: LocationPicker(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class LocationPicker extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LocationPickerState createState() => _LocationPickerState();
}

class _LocationPickerState extends State<LocationPicker> {
  String? country;
  String? state;
  String? city;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Country Picker
        CscPicker(
          onCountryChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              country = value; // Update the selected country
              state = null; // Reset state and city when country changes
              city = null;
            });
          },
          onStateChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              state = value; // Update the selected state
              city = null; // Reset city when state changes
            });
          },
          onCityChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              city = value; // Update the selected city
            });
          },
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        // Display selected location
        Text('Selected Country: $country'),
        Text('Selected State: $state'),
        Text('Selected City: $city'),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the LocationPicker.
// 4. LocationPicker is a StatefulWidget that manages the selected country, state, and city.
// 5. The CscPicker widget is used to allow users to select a country, state, and city.
// 6. When a user selects a country, the state and city are reset, and the selected country is updated.
// 7. Similarly, selecting a state resets the city and updates the selected state.
// 8. The selected country, state, and city are displayed below the picker.
```
