# Widget Visibility Detector: A Comprehensive Overview

The `widget_visibility_detector` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers determine the visibility of widgets within the viewport of a Flutter application. This package is particularly useful for optimizing performance, enhancing user experience, and implementing features that depend on widget visibility, such as lazy loading, animations, or analytics tracking.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `widget_visibility_detector` package in scenarios such as:

- **Lazy Loading**: Load images or data only when they are about to come into view, reducing initial load times and improving performance.
- **Analytics Tracking**: Track user engagement by monitoring which widgets are visible on the screen.
- **Animations**: Trigger animations when a widget becomes visible or invisible, creating a more dynamic user experience.

## Features

- **Visibility Detection**: Easily determine if a widget is visible within the viewport.
- **Callbacks**: Set up callbacks that trigger when a widget's visibility changes.
- **Customizable**: Configure detection thresholds to suit specific needs.

With these features, the `widget_visibility_detector` package provides a robust solution for managing widget visibility in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Widget Visibility Detector

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `widget_visibility_detector` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `widget_visibility_detector` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  widget_visibility_detector: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let’s see how to use it in a Flutter application.

1. **Import the Package**: Import the `widget_visibility_detector` package in your Dart file.

   ```dart
   import 'package:widget_visibility_detector/widget_visibility_detector.dart';
   ```

2. **Wrap Your Widget**: Use the `VisibilityDetector` widget to wrap the widget you want to monitor.

   ```dart
   VisibilityDetector(
     key: Key('my-widget-key'),
     onVisibilityChanged: (VisibilityInfo info) {
       // Handle visibility changes
       print('Widget is ${info.visibleFraction * 100}% visible');
     },
     child: MyWidget(),
   );
   ```

3. **Customize Visibility Detection**: You can customize the detection threshold by adjusting the `visibleFraction` parameter in the `onVisibilityChanged` callback.

With these steps, you can effectively implement the `widget_visibility_detector` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example: Using Widget Visibility Detector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_visibility_detector/widget_visibility_detector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Widget Visibility Detector Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Visibility Detector Demo'),
        ),
        body: VisibilityDemo(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class VisibilityDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: 20, // Create 20 items
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        return VisibilityDetector(
          key: Key('widget-$index'), // Unique key for each widget
          onVisibilityChanged: (VisibilityInfo info) {
            // Log the visibility percentage of the widget
            print('Widget $index is ${info.visibleFraction * 100}% visible');
          },
          child: Container(
            height: 100, // Fixed height for each item
            color: index.isEven ? Colors.blue : Colors.green, // Alternate colors
            alignment: Alignment.center,
            child: Text(
              'Item $index',
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold containing an AppBar and the VisibilityDemo widget.
// 3. VisibilityDemo creates a ListView with 20 items.
// 4. Each item is wrapped in a VisibilityDetector, which monitors its visibility.
// 5. When the visibility of an item changes, the onVisibilityChanged callback is triggered, logging the visibility percentage to the console.
// 6. The items alternate colors for better visibility and are centered with a text label.
```
