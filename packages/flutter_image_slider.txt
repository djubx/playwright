            images: [
              'https://example.com/image1.jpg', // Image from the web
              'https://example.com/image2.jpg', // Another web image
              'assets/images/image3.jpg',       // Local asset image
            ],
            autoSlide: true, // Enable automatic sliding
            slideInterval: Duration(seconds: 3), // Time interval for sliding
            indicator: Indicator(
              // Custom indicator for the slider
