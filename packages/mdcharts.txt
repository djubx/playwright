# Exploring the mdcharts Flutter Package

The `mdcharts` package is a powerful and flexible charting library for Flutter that allows developers to create a variety of charts with ease. It is particularly useful for applications that require data visualization, such as dashboards, analytics tools, and reporting applications. With `mdcharts`, you can create line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and more, all while maintaining a high level of customization.

## When to Use `mdcharts`
- **Data Visualization**: When your application needs to present data in a visual format.
- **Dashboards**: Ideal for creating interactive dashboards that display real-time data.
- **Reports**: Useful for generating reports that require graphical representation of data.

## Key Features
- **Multiple Chart Types**: Supports various chart types including line, bar, and pie charts.
- **Customizable**: Offers extensive customization options for colors, labels, and styles.
- **Responsive**: Charts automatically adjust to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Animations**: Provides smooth animations for chart transitions and updates.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications.

Overall, `mdcharts` is a versatile package that can enhance the user experience by providing clear and engaging data visualizations.

# Setting Up and Using the mdcharts Package

## Installation
To get started with `mdcharts`, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mdcharts: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package. After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a line chart:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mdcharts/mdcharts.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('MDCharts Example')),
        body: LineChart(
          [
            Series(
              id: 'Sales',
              data: [
                {'year': 2018, 'sales': 100},
                {'year': 2019, 'sales': 200},
                {'year': 2020, 'sales': 300},
              ],
              domainFn: (Map<String, dynamic> sales, _) => sales['year'],
              measureFn: (Map<String, dynamic> sales, _) => sales['sales'],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple line chart displaying sales data over three years. You can customize the chart further by adjusting the properties of the `Series` and `LineChart` widgets.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and start using the `mdcharts` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of mdcharts in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mdcharts/mdcharts.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('MDCharts Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0), // Adding padding around the chart
          child: Column(
            children: [
              Text('Sales Data Over Years', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20)), // Title for the chart
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between title and chart
              LineChart( // Creating a LineChart widget
                [
                  Series(
                    id: 'Sales', // Unique identifier for the series
                    data: [ // Data points for the chart

                      {'year': 2020, 'sales': 300},
                      {'year': 2021, 'sales': 400},
                    ],
                    domainFn: (Map<String, dynamic> sales, _) => sales['year'], // X-axis values
                    measureFn: (Map<String, dynamic> sales, _) => sales['sales'], // Y-axis values
                    colorFn: (_, __) => ColorUtil.fromDartColor(Colors.blue), // Color of the line
                  ),
                ],
                animate: true, // Enable animations for the chart
                behaviors: [ // Adding behaviors like tooltips
                  LinePointHighlighter(
                    showHorizontalFollowLine: LineFollowLineType.all, // Show horizontal line on hover
                    showVerticalFollowLine: LineFollowLineType.all, // Show vertical line on hover
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the application
}
```

// The above code creates a Flutter application that displays a line chart using the mdcharts package.
// 
// 1. **Imports**: The necessary packages are imported at the beginning.
// 2. **RealFlutter Class**: This is the main widget of the application, which builds the UI.
// 3. **MaterialApp**: A MaterialApp widget is created to provide material design styling.
// 4. **Scaffold**: A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual structure, including an AppBar and body.
// 5. **Padding**: Padding is added around the chart for better spacing.
// 6. **Column**: A Column widget is used to stack the title and the chart vertically.
// 7. **Text Widget**: Displays the title of the chart.
// 8. **LineChart**: The LineChart widget is created with a series of sales data.
// 9. **Series**: The Series widget defines the data points, domain, and measure functions.
// 10. **Color**: The color of the line is set to blue.
// 11. **Animations**: Animations are enabled for smooth transitions.
// 12. **Behaviors**: A LinePointHighlighter is added to show tooltips when hovering over data points.
// 13. **Main Function**: The main function runs the RealFlutter application.

// This application effectively demonstrates how to use the mdcharts package to visualize data in a line chart format.
