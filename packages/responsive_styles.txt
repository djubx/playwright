# Responsive Styles: A Flutter Package for Adaptive UI

The `responsive_styles` package is designed to help Flutter developers create responsive and adaptive user interfaces that look great on various screen sizes and orientations. With the increasing diversity of devices, ensuring that your app provides a consistent experience across all platforms is crucial. This package simplifies the process of making your UI responsive by allowing you to define styles that adapt based on the screen dimensions.

## When to Use This Package
- **Multi-Device Support**: When your app needs to run on different devices with varying screen sizes, such as phones, tablets, and desktops.
- **Dynamic Layouts**: If your app requires layouts that change based on the orientation (portrait or landscape) or size of the screen.
- **Consistent UI**: To maintain a consistent look and feel across different platforms without manually adjusting styles.

## Key Features
- **Responsive Sizing**: Easily define sizes that adapt to the screen dimensions.
- **Orientation Awareness**: Automatically adjust styles based on the device's orientation.
- **Custom Breakpoints**: Set custom breakpoints for different screen sizes to control how your UI responds.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter's existing layout system.

By leveraging the `responsive_styles` package, developers can create applications that not only look good but also provide a better user experience across all devices.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Responsive Styles

## Installation
To get started with the `responsive_styles` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  responsive_styles: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `responsive_styles` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:responsive_styles/responsive_styles.dart';
```

You can then use the `ResponsiveStyles` class to define styles that adapt to the screen size. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
ResponsiveStyles(
  context: context,
  breakpoints: {
    Breakpoint.sm: 320,
    Breakpoint.md: 768,
    Breakpoint.lg: 1024,
  },
  styles: {
    Breakpoint.sm: TextStyle(fontSize: 12),
    Breakpoint.md: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
    Breakpoint.lg: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
  },
);
```

This code snippet sets different font sizes based on the screen size, ensuring that text is readable on all devices.

# Complete Example: Responsive Styles in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_styles/responsive_styles.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Responsive Styles Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Responsive Styles Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ResponsiveStyles(
            context: context,
            breakpoints: {
              Breakpoint.sm: 320, // Small devices
              Breakpoint.md: 768, // Medium devices
              Breakpoint.lg: 1024, // Large devices
            },
            styles: {
              Breakpoint.sm: TextStyle(fontSize: 12, color: Colors.blue),
              Breakpoint.md: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.green),
              Breakpoint.lg: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.red),
            },
            child: Text(
              'Responsive Text',
              style: ResponsiveStyles.of(context).textStyle,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the responsive_styles package.
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Responsive Styles Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The ResponsiveStyles widget is used to define breakpoints and styles for different screen sizes.
// 6. The breakpoints are defined for small, medium, and large devices.
// 7. The styles for each breakpoint specify different font sizes and colors.
// 8. The Text widget displays 'Responsive Text' with a style that adapts based on the current screen size.
// 9. As the screen size changes, the text size and color will adjust accordingly, demonstrating the responsive capabilities of the package.
