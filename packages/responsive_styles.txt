// The app starts by running the `main` function, which creates a `MaterialApp` with a `RealFlutter` widget as its home.
// The `RealFlutter` widget creates a responsive layout with a row and two columns using the `ResponsiveRow` and `ResponsiveColumn` widgets.
// The first column contains two `AdaptiveText` widgets with different font sizes, which adapt to the screen size and orientation.
// The second column contains a responsive image using the `Image.asset` widget.
// The `ResponsiveStyles` widget wraps the entire app, ensuring that all widgets are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

// This code demonstrates how to use the `responsive_styles` package to create a responsive app with adaptive typography and layouts.
