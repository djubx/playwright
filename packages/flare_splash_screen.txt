# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flare Splash Screen

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flare_splash_screen` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flare_splash_screen` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flare_splash_screen: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flare_splash_screen/flare_splash_screen.dart';
```

## Step 3: Prepare Your Flare Animation

You need a Flare animation file (`.flr`) to use with the splash screen. You can create your own animation using the Rive app or download one from the Rive website. Place the `.flr` file in your project's `assets` directory and update your `pubspec.yaml` to include it:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/your_animation.flr
```

## Step 4: Implement the Splash Screen

Now, you can implement the splash screen in your main application file. Below are platform-specific details:

### Android Configuration

Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the correct settings for your app's theme and splash screen. You may want to set a theme that matches your splash screen's design.

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your app's launch screen storyboard is set up correctly to avoid any flickering when transitioning from the splash screen to the main app.

## Step 5: Example Implementation

You can now use the `FlareSplashScreen` widget in your app. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flare_splash_screen/flare_splash_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flare Splash Screen Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FlareSplashScreen(
      'assets/your_animation.flr', // Path to your Flare animation
      HomeScreen(), // The next screen to navigate to
      startAnimation: 'start', // The animation name to start
      duration: 3000, // Duration of the splash screen in milliseconds
      backgroundColor: Colors.white, // Background color of the splash screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Flare Splash Screen

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flare_splash_screen/flare_splash_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Entry point of the application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flare Splash Screen Example', // Title of the app
      home: RealFlutter(), // Home widget that contains the splash screen
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FlareSplashScreen(
      'assets/your_animation.flr', // Path to your Flare animation file
      HomeScreen(), // The widget to navigate to after the splash screen
      startAnimation: 'start', // The name of the animation to play
      duration: 3000, // Duration of the splash screen in milliseconds
      backgroundColor: Colors.white, // Background color of the splash screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'), // Title of the home screen
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!'), // Welcome message
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget, which is the root of the application.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter uses FlareSplashScreen to display the splash animation.
// 4. The splash screen plays the specified Flare animation for 3000 milliseconds.
// 5. After the animation completes, it navigates to the HomeScreen widget.
// 6. HomeScreen displays a simple welcome message in the center of the screen.
```
