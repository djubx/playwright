# Overview of the `two_dimensional_scrollables` Flutter Package

The `two_dimensional_scrollables` package is a powerful Flutter library designed to facilitate the creation of scrollable widgets that can scroll in both horizontal and vertical directions. This package is particularly useful for applications that require complex layouts, such as spreadsheets, large data tables, or any UI component that needs to display a large amount of content in a confined space.

## When to Use

- **Data Grids**: Ideal for applications that need to display data in a grid format, allowing users to scroll through rows and columns seamlessly.
- **Image Galleries**: Useful for creating galleries where users can scroll through images both horizontally and vertically.
- **Custom Layouts**: Perfect for custom UI designs that require two-dimensional scrolling capabilities.

## Features

- **Bidirectional Scrolling**: Provides smooth scrolling in both horizontal and vertical directions.
- **Customizable Scroll Physics**: Allows developers to define custom scroll behaviors.
- **Integration with Existing Widgets**: Can be easily integrated with other Flutter widgets to create complex UI components.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Designed to handle large amounts of data efficiently, ensuring smooth scrolling experiences.

# Setting Up and Using the `two_dimensional_scrollables` Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `two_dimensional_scrollables` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter project.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     two_dimensional_scrollables: ^0.1.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Import the Package**: Import the package in your Dart file where you plan to use it:
   ```dart
   import 'package:two_dimensional_scrollables/two_dimensional_scrollables.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support all features of the package.

### iOS

- Make sure your iOS deployment target is set to 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Usage

To use the `two_dimensional_scrollables` package, wrap your content with the `TwoDimensionalScrollView` widget. This widget provides the necessary scrolling functionality.

```dart
TwoDimensionalScrollView(
  child: RealFlutter(
    // Your custom widget here
  ),
)
```

# Complete Example of Using `two_dimensional_scrollables`

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `two_dimensional_scrollables` package. This example demonstrates how to create a simple grid that can be scrolled in both directions.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:two_dimensional_scrollables/two_dimensional_scrollables.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Two Dimensional Scrollables Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('2D Scrollable Grid'),
      ),
      body: TwoDimensionalScrollView(
        // The TwoDimensionalScrollView widget enables scrolling in both directions
        child: RealFlutter(
          // RealFlutter is a placeholder for your custom widget
          child: _buildGrid(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Widget _buildGrid() {
    // This method builds a simple grid layout
    return Column(
      children: List.generate(10, (rowIndex) {
        // Create 10 rows
        return Row(
          children: List.generate(10, (colIndex) {
            // Create 10 columns per row
            return Container(
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
              color: (rowIndex + colIndex) % 2 == 0 ? Colors.blue : Colors.green,
              child: Center(
                child: Text('($rowIndex, $colIndex)'),
              ),
            );
          }),
        );
      }),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts with the `main` function, which calls `runApp` with `MyApp`.
// `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The home of the app is `MyHomePage`, which is another stateless widget.
// `MyHomePage` contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// The body uses `TwoDimensionalScrollView` to enable scrolling in both directions.
// Inside the scroll view, `RealFlutter` is used as a placeholder for custom widgets.
// `_buildGrid` method creates a 10x10 grid using nested `Column` and `Row` widgets.
// Each cell in the grid is a `Container` with alternating colors and a centered text label.

// Application Flow Summary:
// 1. The app initializes and displays `MyHomePage`.
// 2. `MyHomePage` sets up a scrollable grid using `TwoDimensionalScrollView`.
// 3. The grid is built with 10 rows and 10 columns, each cell displaying its coordinates.
// 4. Users can scroll horizontally and vertically to view the entire grid.
