# Complete Example of Remove Markdown Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:remove_markdown/remove_markdown.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Remove Markdown Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Remove Markdown Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: MarkdownDisplay(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MarkdownDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample Markdown text
    String markdownText = "# Hello World\nThis is a **bold** statement.\n- Item 1\n- Item 2";

    // Remove Markdown formatting
    String plainText = removeMarkdown(markdownText);

    // Display the plain text in a Text widget
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Text(
        plainText,
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body that centers the MarkdownDisplay widget.
// 4. The MarkdownDisplay widget defines a sample Markdown string.
// 5. The removeMarkdown function is called to strip the Markdown formatting from the string.
// 6. The cleaned plain text is displayed in a Text widget with padding for better readability.
