# Koala Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation

To get started with the Koala package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  koala: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package. After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter and the Koala package. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

Once you have installed the Koala package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a data model and display it in a Flutter widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:koala/koala.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a simple data model using Koala
    final dataModel = KoalaModel(data: 'Hello, Koala!');

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Koala Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(dataModel.data), // Display the data
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple data model using Koala and display its data in a Flutter widget. The `KoalaModel` class is used to manage the data, making it easy to update and display.

# Koala Flutter Package: Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:koala/koala.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a simple data model using Koala
    final dataModel = KoalaModel(data: 'Hello, Koala!');

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Koala Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(dataModel.data), // Display the data
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, we create an instance of KoalaModel with initial data.
// 4. The MaterialApp widget is used to set up the app's structure.
// 5. A Scaffold widget provides a basic layout structure with an AppBar and a body.
// 6. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 7. The Text widget displays the data from the KoalaModel instance.
// 8. When the app runs, it shows "Hello, Koala!" in the center of the screen.
