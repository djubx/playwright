# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_security_checker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_security_checker` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_security_checker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_security_checker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_security_checker).

## Step 2: Running the Package

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add specific configurations in your `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the `flutter_security_checker` in your app.

# Complete Example of flutter_security_checker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_security_checker/flutter_security_checker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Security Checker Demo',
      home: SecurityCheckScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class SecurityCheckScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SecurityCheckScreenState createState() => _SecurityCheckScreenState();
}

class _SecurityCheckScreenState extends State<SecurityCheckScreen> {
  String _securityReport = "Checking security...";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _checkSecurity();
  }

  // Method to check security using the flutter_security_checker package
  Future<void> _checkSecurity() async {
    // Start the security check
    final report = await FlutterSecurityChecker.check();
    
    // Update the state with the security report
    setState(() {
      _securityReport = report;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Security Checker'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Text(
            _securityReport,
            textAlign: TextAlign.center,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. SecurityCheckScreen is a stateful widget that checks security on initialization.
// 4. In initState, _checkSecurity is called to perform the security check.
// 5. _checkSecurity uses the FlutterSecurityChecker to check for vulnerabilities.
// 6. The security report is updated in the state and displayed in the UI.
```
