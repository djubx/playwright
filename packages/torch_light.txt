Here's a detailed technical blog on the "torch_light" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `torch_light` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to control the device's flashlight (torch) functionality. This package is particularly useful for applications that require quick access to the flashlight, such as flashlight apps, camera applications, or any utility app that benefits from illumination.

## When to Use `torch_light`

You might consider using the `torch_light` package in scenarios such as:
- Creating a flashlight app that allows users to toggle the flashlight on and off.
- Integrating flashlight functionality into a camera app for better low-light photography.
- Developing utility apps that require temporary lighting, like QR code scanners or document scanners.

## Features

- **Simple API**: The package provides an easy-to-use API for toggling the flashlight.
- **Platform Support**: It supports both Android and iOS platforms, ensuring a wide range of device compatibility.
- **Real-time Control**: Users can turn the flashlight on and off in real-time, providing immediate feedback.

Overall, `torch_light` is a lightweight and efficient solution for managing flashlight functionality in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `torch_light` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `torch_light` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  torch_light: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/torch_light).

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

1. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permission inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FLASHLIGHT"/>
```

#### iOS

1. Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key-value pair to request permission to use the flashlight:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the camera for flashlight functionality.</string>
```

### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:torch_light/torch_light.dart';
```

## Using the Package

You can now use the `torch_light` package to control the flashlight. Here’s a simple example of how to toggle the flashlight on and off:

```dart
void toggleFlashlight() async {
  // Check if the device has a flashlight
  if (await TorchLight.hasTorch) {
    // Toggle the flashlight
    await TorchLight.toggle();
  } else {
    print("This device does not have a flashlight.");
  }
}
```

This function checks if the device has a flashlight and toggles it accordingly.

# Complete Example

Here’s a complete Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `torch_light` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:torch_light/torch_light.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isTorchOn = false; // State variable to track flashlight status

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Check if the device has a flashlight on initialization
    _checkTorchAvailability();
  }

  // Function to check if the device has a flashlight
  void _checkTorchAvailability() async {
    if (await TorchLight.hasTorch) {
      print("Flashlight is available.");
    } else {
      print("This device does not have a flashlight.");
    }
  }

  // Function to toggle the flashlight
  void _toggleFlashlight() async {
    if (await TorchLight.hasTorch) {
      // Toggle the flashlight and update the state
      await TorchLight.toggle();
      setState(() {
        _isTorchOn = !_isTorchOn; // Update the flashlight status
      });
    } else {
      print("This device does not have a flashlight.");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Torch Light Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                _isTorchOn ? 'Flashlight is ON' : 'Flashlight is OFF',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _toggleFlashlight, // Call toggle function on button press
                child: Text(_isTorchOn ? 'Turn OFF' : 'Turn ON'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the flashlight.
// 3. In the initState method, it checks if the device has a flashlight available.
// 4. The _toggleFlashlight method toggles the flashlight on and off and updates the state variable _isTorchOn.
// 5. The UI displays the current status of the flashlight and provides a button to toggle it.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the flashlight state changes, and the UI updates accordingly.
```
