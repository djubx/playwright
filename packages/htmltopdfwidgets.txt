# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using htmltopdfwidgets

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `htmltopdfwidgets` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  htmltopdfwidgets: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save PDFs.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to scan documents.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to convert HTML content to a PDF document.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:htmltopdfwidgets/htmltopdfwidgets.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('HTML to PDF Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define your HTML content
              String htmlContent = """
                <h1>Invoice</h1>
                <p>This is a sample invoice generated from HTML.</p>
              """;

              // Convert HTML to PDF
              final pdfFile = await HtmlToPdf.convertFromHtml(
                htmlContent,
                fileName: 'invoice.pdf',
              );

              // Notify user of success
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('PDF saved at: ${pdfFile.path}')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Generate PDF'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the HTML content is converted to a PDF file and saved to the device.

# Complete Example of htmltopdfwidgets

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:htmltopdfwidgets/htmltopdfwidgets.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('HTML to PDF Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define your HTML content
              String htmlContent = """
                <h1>Invoice</h1>
                <p>This is a sample invoice generated from HTML.</p>
              """;

              // Convert HTML to PDF
              final pdfFile = await HtmlToPdf.convertFromHtml(
                htmlContent,
                fileName: 'invoice.pdf',
              );

              // Notify user of success
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('PDF saved at: ${pdfFile.path}')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Generate PDF'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. The HTML content is defined as a string.
// 6. The HtmlToPdf.convertFromHtml method is called to convert the HTML string into a PDF file.
// 7. Once the PDF is generated, a SnackBar is displayed to notify the user of the file's location.
```
