# Understanding the rfc_6902 Flutter Package

The `rfc_6902` package is a Flutter implementation of JSON Patch, which is a standard format for describing changes to a JSON document. This package is particularly useful when you need to apply partial updates to JSON data structures, making it ideal for applications that require efficient data synchronization, such as collaborative applications or real-time data updates.

## When to Use `rfc_6902`
- **Collaborative Applications**: When multiple users are editing the same data, and you want to send only the changes rather than the entire document.
- **Real-time Data Updates**: In scenarios where data is frequently updated, and you want to minimize the amount of data sent over the network.
- **Optimizing Network Usage**: When working with limited bandwidth, sending only the necessary changes can significantly reduce data usage.

## Key Features
- **JSON Patch Support**: Implements the JSON Patch standard (RFC 6902) for modifying JSON documents.
- **Efficient Updates**: Allows for efficient updates by applying only the changes rather than replacing entire objects.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the rfc_6902 Package

## Installation
To use the `rfc_6902` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rfc_6902: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `rfc_6902` package is platform-agnostic, meaning it works seamlessly on both Android and iOS without any additional configuration. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `rfc_6902` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:rfc_6902/rfc_6902.dart';
   ```

2. Create a JSON document and a patch:
   ```dart
   final originalJson = {
     "name": "John",
     "age": 30,
     "city": "New York"
   };

   final patch = [
     {"op": "replace", "path": "/age", "value": 31},
     {"op": "add", "path": "/country", "value": "USA"}
   ];
   ```

3. Apply the patch:
   ```dart
   final updatedJson = JsonPatch.apply(originalJson, patch);
   ```

4. The `updatedJson` will now reflect the changes made by the patch.

# Complete Example of Using rfc_6902

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rfc_6902/rfc_6902.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'RFC 6902 Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('JSON Patch Example'),
        ),
        body: JsonPatchDemo(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class JsonPatchDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _JsonPatchDemoState createState() => _JsonPatchDemoState();
}

class _JsonPatchDemoState extends State<JsonPatchDemo> {
  Map<String, dynamic> originalJson = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
  };

  Map<String, dynamic> updatedJson;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Define the patch to apply
    final patch = [
      {"op": "replace", "path": "/age", "value": 31},
      {"op": "add", "path": "/country", "value": "USA"}
    ];

    // Apply the patch to the original JSON
    updatedJson = JsonPatch.apply(originalJson, patch);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Original JSON:'),
        Text(originalJson.toString()),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        Text('Updated JSON:'),
        Text(updatedJson.toString()),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// The application starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// Inside RealFlutter, we set up a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// The home widget is a Scaffold that contains an AppBar and a body.
// The body is a JsonPatchDemo widget that demonstrates the use of the rfc_6902 package.
// In the JsonPatchDemo state, we define the original JSON and the patch to apply.
// The patch is applied in the initState method, which updates the JSON.
// Finally, we display both the original and updated JSON in the UI.
