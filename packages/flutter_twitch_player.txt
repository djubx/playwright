### Tutorial

To get started with the `flutter_twitch_player` package, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:

```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_twitch_player).

#### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

**For Android:**
- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

**For iOS:**
- Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

#### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_twitch_player/flutter_twitch_player.dart';
```

#### Step 4: Basic Usage

You can now use the `TwitchPlayer` widget in your application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Twitch Player Example')),
        body: TwitchPlayer(
          channel: 'twitch_channel_name', // Replace with the desired Twitch channel
          width: double.infinity,
          height: 400,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_twitch_player/flutter_twitch_player.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Twitch Player Example')),
        body: TwitchPlayer(
          channel: 'twitch_channel_name', // Replace with the desired Twitch channel
          width: double.infinity, // Set the width to fill the screen
          height: 400, // Set a fixed height for the player
          onPlayerStateChanged: (state) {
            // Listen to player state changes
            print('Player state changed: $state');
          },
          onError: (error) {
            // Handle errors
            print('Error occurred: $error');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The RealFlutter class is the main entry point of the application.
// It creates a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// The body consists of a TwitchPlayer widget that streams a specified Twitch channel.
// The player is set to fill the width of the screen and has a fixed height of 400 pixels.
// The onPlayerStateChanged callback allows you to listen for changes in the player's state,
// while the onError callback handles any errors that may occur during streaming.
// This setup provides a simple yet effective way to integrate Twitch streaming into your Flutter app.
