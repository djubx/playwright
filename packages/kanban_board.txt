# Tutorial: Setting Up the Kanban Board Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **kanban_board** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the **kanban_board** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  kanban_board: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/kanban_board).

## Step 2: Install Packages
Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:kanban_board/kanban_board.dart';
```

## Step 5: Basic Usage
You can now use the **kanban_board** in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a Kanban board.

```dart
// Create a Kanban board with sample data
KanbanBoard(
  columns: [
    KanbanColumn(
      title: 'To Do',
      tasks: [
        KanbanTask(title: 'Task 1'),
        KanbanTask(title: 'Task 2'),
      ],
    ),
    KanbanColumn(
      title: 'In Progress',
      tasks: [
        KanbanTask(title: 'Task 3'),
      ],
    ),
    KanbanColumn(
      title: 'Done',
      tasks: [],
    ),
  ],
)
```

This code snippet creates a simple Kanban board with three columns: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done," each containing a few tasks.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the **kanban_board** package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of a Kanban Board Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kanban_board/kanban_board.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyKanbanApp());
}

class MyKanbanApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Kanban Board Example',
      home: KanbanHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class KanbanHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Kanban Board'),
      ),
      body: KanbanBoard(
        columns: [
          KanbanColumn(
            title: 'To Do',
            tasks: [
              KanbanTask(title: 'Task 1'),
              KanbanTask(title: 'Task 2'),
            ],
          ),
          KanbanColumn(
            title: 'In Progress',
            tasks: [
              KanbanTask(title: 'Task 3'),
            ],
          ),
          KanbanColumn(
            title: 'Done',
            tasks: [],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyKanbanApp.
// 2. MyKanbanApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. The KanbanHomePage widget is created, which contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains the KanbanBoard widget, which is initialized with three columns: 'To Do', 'In Progress', and 'Done'.
// 5. Each column is populated with tasks, demonstrating the drag-and-drop functionality of the kanban_board package.
// 6. Users can interact with the board by moving tasks between columns, providing a visual representation of task progress.
