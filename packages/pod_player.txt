## Setup Process

To get started with the `pod_player` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `pod_player` dependency.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     pod_player: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/pod_player).

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest
         ...
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open your `ios/Podfile` and ensure that the platform is set to at least 10.0:

     ```ruby
     platform :ios, '10.0'
     ```

4. **Permissions**: Depending on your media source, you may need to request permissions for accessing local files or the internet. For example, if you are streaming media, ensure you have the necessary internet permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

## Using the Package

To use the `pod_player` package, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:pod_player/pod_player.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize the Player**: Create an instance of `PodPlayer` in your widget.

   ```dart
   final podPlayerController = PodPlayerController();
   ```

3. **Build the Player Widget**: Use the `PodPlayer` widget in your widget tree.

   ```dart
   PodPlayer(
     controller: podPlayerController,
   )
   ```

4. **Control Playback**: Use the controller methods to play, pause, or seek media.

   ```dart
   podPlayerController.play();
   podPlayerController.pause();
   podPlayerController.seekTo(Duration(seconds: 10));
   ```

5. **Listen for Events**: You can listen for playback state changes using the provided callbacks.

   ```dart
   podPlayerController.addListener(() {
     // Handle state changes
   });
   ```

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the `pod_player` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pod_player/pod_player.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pod Player Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late PodPlayerController podPlayerController;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the PodPlayerController with a video URL
    podPlayerController = PodPlayerController(
      playVideoFrom: 'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // Replace with your media URL
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    podPlayerController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pod Player Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the PodPlayer widget
            PodPlayer(
              controller: podPlayerController,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Play button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Play the media
                podPlayerController.play();
              },
              child: Text('Play'),
            ),
            // Pause button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Pause the media
                podPlayerController.pause();
              },
              child: Text('Pause'),
            ),
            // Seek button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Seek to 10 seconds
                podPlayerController.seekTo(Duration(seconds: 10));
              },
              child: Text('Seek to 10s'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter initializes the PodPlayerController in its initState method with a media URL.
// 4. The PodPlayer widget is displayed in the center of the screen, allowing media playback.
// 5. Three buttons are provided to control playback: Play, Pause, and Seek to 10 seconds.
// 6. The controller is disposed of in the dispose method to free up resources when the widget is removed.
