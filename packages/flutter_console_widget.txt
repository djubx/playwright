# Setting Up and Using Flutter Console Widget

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_console_widget`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_console_widget: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_console_widget).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if your console widget interacts with system features. However, for basic usage, no additional configurations are typically required.

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_console_widget`, you can create a simple console interface in your Flutter app. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_console_widget/flutter_console_widget.dart';
   ```

2. Create a `ConsoleWidget` in your widget tree:
   ```dart
   ConsoleWidget(
     onCommand: (command) {
       // Handle command execution
     },
   );
   ```

3. Customize the console as needed, such as changing the background color or text style.

With these steps, you can easily integrate a console widget into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Flutter Console Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_console_widget/flutter_console_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Console Widget Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ConsoleScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ConsoleScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ConsoleScreenState createState() => _ConsoleScreenState();
}

class _ConsoleScreenState extends State<ConsoleScreen> {
  // This method will handle the commands entered by the user
  void _handleCommand(String command) {
    // For demonstration, we will just echo the command back
    // In a real application, you would execute the command here
    print('Command entered: $command');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Console Widget Example'),
      ),
      body: ConsoleWidget(
        onCommand: _handleCommand, // Set the command handler
        backgroundColor: Colors.black, // Set the background color
        textStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.green), // Set text color
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to ConsoleScreen, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In ConsoleScreen, we define a method _handleCommand to process user input.
// 5. The ConsoleWidget is created in the build method, with a command handler and styling.
// 6. When a user enters a command, it triggers the onCommand callback, which currently just prints the command to the console.
