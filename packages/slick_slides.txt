# Setting Up and Using Slick Slides

## Installation
To add the **slick_slides** package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  slick_slides: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the **slick_slides** package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:slick_slides/slick_slides.dart';
```

You can then create a simple carousel by using the `SlickSlides` widget. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
SlickSlides(
  images: [
    'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
  ],
  autoPlay: true,
  duration: Duration(seconds: 3),
)
```

This code snippet creates a carousel that automatically transitions between three images every three seconds.

# Complete Example of Slick Slides in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:slick_slides/slick_slides.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Slick Slides Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Slick Slides Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SlickSlides(
            images: [
              'https://example.com/image1.jpg', // First image URL
              'https://example.com/image2.jpg', // Second image URL
              'https://example.com/image3.jpg', // Third image URL
            ],
            autoPlay: true, // Enable auto-play feature
            duration: Duration(seconds: 3), // Duration for each slide
            indicator: true, // Show indicator dots
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the slick_slides package.
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Slick Slides Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The SlickSlides widget is used to create the image carousel, where:
//    - The images list contains URLs of the images to be displayed.
//    - The autoPlay property is set to true, enabling automatic transitions.
//    - The duration property specifies how long each slide is displayed.
//    - The indicator property is set to true, which shows the current slide indicator dots.
