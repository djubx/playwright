# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Swiss Knife

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the swiss_knife package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  swiss_knife: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the swiss_knife package as follows:

```dart
import 'package:swiss_knife/swiss_knife.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Swiss Knife Features

You can now utilize the various features of the swiss_knife package. For example, to manipulate a list of integers:

```dart
List<int> numbers = [5, 3, 8, 1];
List<int> sortedNumbers = SwissKnife.sort(numbers);
print(sortedNumbers); // Output: [1, 3, 5, 8]
```

This simple example demonstrates how to sort a list using the swiss_knife package. You can explore other functionalities such as string manipulation and date handling similarly.

# Complete Example of Swiss Knife in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:swiss_knife/swiss_knife.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Swiss Knife Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Swiss Knife Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Sorted Numbers: ${_getSortedNumbers()}'),
              Text('Formatted Date: ${_getFormattedDate()}'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to get sorted numbers using swiss_knife
  String _getSortedNumbers() {
    List<int> numbers = [5, 3, 8, 1];
    List<int> sortedNumbers = SwissKnife.sort(numbers);
    return sortedNumbers.join(', '); // Convert list to string for display
  }

  // Function to get formatted current date using swiss_knife
  String _getFormattedDate() {
    DateTime now = DateTime.now();
    return SwissKnife.formatDate(now, format: 'yyyy-MM-dd');
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds a Column.
// 4. Inside the Column, two Text widgets display the sorted numbers and the formatted current date.
// 5. The _getSortedNumbers function sorts a predefined list of integers using the swiss_knife package and returns a string representation of the sorted list.
// 6. The _getFormattedDate function retrieves the current date and formats it using the swiss_knife package, returning the formatted date as a string.
// 7. The results are displayed in the app's UI, showcasing the utility of the swiss_knife package for data manipulation and date formatting.
