void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Document Scanner',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  // Create an instance of the DocumentScanner class
  DocumentScanner scanner = DocumentScanner();

  // Store the scanned image
  Uint8List? image;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {

        title: Text('Document Scanner'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the scanned image
            image != null
                ? Image.memory(image!)
                : Text('No image scanned'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Scan button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Scan a document
                scanner.scan().then((scannedImage) {
                  setState(() {
                    image = scannedImage;
                  });
                });
              },
              child: Text('Scan Document'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a scan button.
// 2. When the user clicks the scan button, the DocumentScanner class is used to scan a document.
// 3. The scanned image is stored in the image variable and displayed on the screen.
// 4. The user can repeat the scanning process by clicking the scan button again.
```

// Final summary:
// The code flows by first creating an instance of the DocumentScanner class.
// When the user clicks the scan button, the DocumentScanner class is used to scan a document.
// The scanned image is then stored and displayed on the screen.
// The user can repeat the scanning process by clicking the scan button again.
