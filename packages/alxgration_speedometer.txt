# Overview of the alxgration_speedometer Flutter Package

The `alxgration_speedometer` package is a Flutter library designed to create customizable speedometer widgets for your applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require real-time speed tracking, such as navigation apps, fitness trackers, or any app that needs to display speed-related data visually.

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the `alxgration_speedometer` package in scenarios such as:
- Building a GPS-based navigation app that displays the current speed of the user.
- Creating a fitness app that tracks running or cycling speed.
- Developing a vehicle dashboard application that shows speed metrics.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Design**: The speedometer can be styled to fit the theme of your application.
- **Real-time Updates**: It supports real-time data updates, making it suitable for dynamic applications.
- **Multiple Modes**: You can switch between different speedometer modes (e.g., digital, analog).
- **Animation Support**: Smooth animations for speed changes enhance user experience.

Overall, the `alxgration_speedometer` package provides a robust solution for integrating speedometer functionality into your Flutter applications.

# Setup and Usage of alxgration_speedometer

## Installation
To add the `alxgration_speedometer` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  alxgration_speedometer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/alxgration_speedometer).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `alxgration_speedometer` package, you can create a simple widget that displays the speedometer. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alxgration_speedometer/alxgration_speedometer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Speedometer Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Speedometer(
          currentValue: 50, // Current speed value
          maxValue: 120,    // Maximum speed value
          displayText: 'Speed', // Text to display
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple speedometer widget that displays a current speed of 50 out of a maximum of 120. You can customize the `currentValue`, `maxValue`, and `displayText` as needed.

With this setup, you are ready to start using the `alxgration_speedometer` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of alxgration_speedometer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alxgration_speedometer/alxgration_speedometer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Speedometer App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _currentSpeed = 0; // Variable to hold the current speed

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Simulate speed updates every second
    _simulateSpeedUpdates();
  }

  void _simulateSpeedUpdates() {
    // Use a timer to update the speed every second
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () {
      setState(() {
        // Randomly change the speed for demonstration
        _currentSpeed = (_currentSpeed + 10) % 120; // Loop speed between 0 and 120
      });
      _simulateSpeedUpdates(); // Call the function again for continuous updates
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Speedometer Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Speedometer(
          currentValue: _currentSpeed, // Pass the current speed to the speedometer
          maxValue: 120, // Set the maximum speed value
          displayText: 'Current Speed', // Text to display on the speedometer
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created as a StatefulWidget to manage the current speed state.
// 3. In the initState method, we start simulating speed updates using a timer.
// 4. The _simulateSpeedUpdates method updates the current speed every second, looping it between 0 and 120.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Speedometer widget displaying the current speed.
// 6. The Speedometer widget updates in real-time as the _currentSpeed variable changes.
