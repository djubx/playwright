# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple 3D Renderer

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **simple_3d_renderer** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **simple_3d_renderer** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_3d_renderer: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if you plan to use device sensors or camera features.

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key to allow camera usage if needed:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the camera for 3D rendering.</string>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple 3D scene.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:simple_3d_renderer/simple_3d_renderer.dart';
   ```

2. Create a new Flutter widget that utilizes the **RealFlutter** class to render a 3D object:

   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Simple 3D Renderer')),
         body: Center(
           child: Simple3DRenderer(
             // Define your 3D object here
             object: My3DObject(),
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

3. Finally, run your application to see the 3D rendering in action!

This tutorial provides a basic overview of how to set up and use the **simple_3d_renderer** package in your Flutter application. You can further explore the package's documentation for advanced features and customization options.

# Complete Example of Simple 3D Renderer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_3d_renderer/simple_3d_renderer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple 3D Renderer Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Simple 3D Renderer')),
      body: Center(
        child: Simple3DRenderer(
          // Here we define the 3D object to be rendered
          object: My3DObject(),
          // You can customize the rendering options here
          backgroundColor: Colors.black,
          onRender: () {
            // Callback when rendering is complete
            print('Rendering complete!');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The My3DObject class represents the 3D object to be rendered.
// You can define its properties and methods as needed.
class My3DObject extends Simple3DObject {
  @override
  void render() {
    // Implement the rendering logic for your 3D object here
    // This could involve defining vertices, colors, and textures
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home widget as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter builds the UI, including an AppBar and a Simple3DRenderer widget.
// 4. Simple3DRenderer takes a My3DObject instance to render in the center of the screen.
// 5. The render method in My3DObject is where the actual 3D rendering logic is implemented.
// 6. The onRender callback provides a way to execute code after rendering is complete.
```
