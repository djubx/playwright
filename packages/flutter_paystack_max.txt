# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_paystack_max

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **flutter_paystack_max** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **flutter_paystack_max** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_paystack_max: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_paystack_max).

## Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, you need to add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

Also, ensure that you have the correct Paystack public key in your application. You can obtain this from your Paystack dashboard.

## Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

This allows your app to make network requests to Paystack's servers.

## Step 4: Initialize Paystack

In your Flutter application, you need to initialize Paystack with your public key. This is typically done in the `main` function or the first screen of your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_paystack_max/flutter_paystack_max.dart';

void main() {
  PaystackPlugin.initialize(publicKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY");
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Implement Payment

You can now implement the payment functionality in your app. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate a payment:

```dart
void startPayment() async {
  final charge = Charge()
    ..amount = 10000 // Amount in kobo
    ..email = "customer@example.com"
    ..currency = "NGN";

  final response = await PaystackPlugin.checkout(context,
      charge: charge,
      method: CheckoutMethod.card,
      fullscreen: true);

  if (response.status) {
    // Payment was successful
    print("Payment successful: ${response.reference}");
  } else {
    // Payment failed
    print("Payment failed: ${response.message}");
  }
}
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up the **flutter_paystack_max** package in your Flutter application. You can now accept payments using Paystack.

# Complete Example of flutter_paystack_max

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_paystack_max/flutter_paystack_max.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Paystack with your public key
  PaystackPlugin.initialize(publicKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY");
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Paystack Payment Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Paystack Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Start the payment process when the button is pressed
            startPayment(context);
          },
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void startPayment(BuildContext context) async {
    // Create a Charge object with the payment details
    final charge = Charge()
      ..amount = 10000 // Amount in kobo (10000 kobo = 100 NGN)
      ..email = "customer@example.com" // Customer's email
      ..currency = "NGN"; // Currency

    // Initiate the checkout process
    final response = await PaystackPlugin.checkout(context,
        charge: charge,
        method: CheckoutMethod.card, // Payment method
        fullscreen: true); // Fullscreen checkout

    // Check the response status
    if (response.status) {
      // Payment was successful
      print("Payment successful: ${response.reference}");
      // You can navigate to a success screen or show a success message
    } else {
      // Payment failed
      print("Payment failed: ${response.message}");
      // You can show an error message to the user
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes Paystack with the public key.
// 2. The main screen displays a button labeled "Pay Now."
// 3. When the button is pressed, the startPayment function is called.
// 4. A Charge object is created with the payment details (amount, email, currency).
// 5. The Paystack checkout process is initiated.
// 6. The user is presented with the Paystack payment interface.
// 7. After the payment is completed, the response is checked.
// 8. If the payment is successful, a success message is printed; otherwise, an error message is printed.
```
