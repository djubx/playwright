```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pixelarticons/pixelarticons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pixel Art Icons Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Centered Icon
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pixel Art Icons Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Use the Icon widget to display a pixel art icon
        child: Icon(
          // Use the PixelArtIcons class to access the icon
          PixelArtIcons.android,
          // Set the size of the icon
          size: 64,
          // Set the color of the icon
          color: Colors.green,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and the MyApp widget is created.
// 2. The MyApp widget builds the MaterialApp with the RealFlutter widget as the home page.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds the Scaffold with the AppBar and the Centered Icon.
// 4. The Icon widget is used to display the pixel art icon.
// 5. The PixelArtIcons class is used to access the icon.
// 6. The size and color properties are used to customize the icon.

// Final Summary:
// This code demonstrates how to use the PixelArtIcons package in a Flutter app.
// It shows how to create a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Centered Icon, and how to use the Icon widget to display a pixel art icon.
// The code also explains the application flow and how the different widgets are used to create the final UI.
