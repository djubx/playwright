# Setting Up the Package
-------------------------

To use the `simple_moment` package in your Flutter application, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Here's how to do it:

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:
```yml
dependencies:
  simple_moment: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to get the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
---------------------------

This package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you need to configure the package differently for each platform.

### Android

For Android, you need to add the following line to your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

  implementation 'com.github.marlonlom.utilities-timeago:1.6.3'
}
```

  void _calculateDuration() {
    // Calculate the duration between two dates using the simple_moment package
    DateTime startDate = DateTime(2022, 1, 1);
    DateTime endDate = DateTime(2022, 1, 15);
    Duration duration = Moment(endDate).durationSince(startDate);
    print(duration.inDays);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Simple Moment Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Current Date and Time:',
            ),
            Text(
              _dateTime.toString(),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _formatDateTime,
              child: Text('Format Date and Time'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _calculateDuration,
              child: Text('Calculate Duration'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a screen showing the current date and time.
// 2. The user can click the "Format Date and Time" button to format the date and time using the simple_moment package.
// 3. The user can click the "Calculate Duration" button to calculate the duration between two dates using the simple_moment package.
// 4. The formatted date and time or the calculated duration is printed to the console.

// In summary, this code demonstrates how to use the simple_moment package to format dates and times, calculate durations, and perform other common date-related tasks.
