# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `image_editor_dove`

## Installation
To get started with the `image_editor_dove` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_editor_dove: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/image_editor_dove).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read and write to external storage. Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` to request permission for accessing the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to edit images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need permission to save edited images to your photo library.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement image editing functionality.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_editor_dove/image_editor_dove.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: ImageEditorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ImageEditorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImageEditorScreenState createState() => _ImageEditorScreenState();
}

class _ImageEditorScreenState extends State<ImageEditorScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the image file
  Image? _image;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Editor')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected image
            _image != null ? _image! : Text('No image selected.'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _editImage,
              child: Text('Edit Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to edit the image
  void _editImage() async {
    // Load the image from assets or gallery
    // For demonstration, we will use a placeholder image
    final image = await ImageEditor.editImage(
      image: AssetImage('assets/sample_image.png'),
      // Add editing options here
    );

    // Update the state with the edited image
    setState(() {
      _image = image;
    });
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that allows users to edit an image. The `ImageEditorScreen` widget contains a button that triggers the image editing process.

            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _editImage,
              child: Text('Edit Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to edit the image
  void _editImage() async {
    // Load the image from assets or gallery
    // For demonstration, we will use a placeholder image
    final image = await ImageEditor.editImage(
      image: AssetImage('assets/sample_image.png'),
      // Add editing options here
    );

    // Update the state with the edited image
    setState(() {
      _image = image;
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The ImageEditorScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. Inside ImageEditorScreen, we have a stateful widget that manages the image state.
// 4. The build method displays the current image or a placeholder text if no image is selected.
// 5. When the "Edit Image" button is pressed, the _editImage function is called.
// 6. The _editImage function uses the ImageEditor class to load and edit an image.
// 7. After editing, the state is updated to display the edited image on the screen.
