# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_animated_icons

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_animated_icons` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_animated_icons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement an animated icon in your app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_animated_icons/flutter_animated_icons.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Animated Icons Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedIcon(
            icon: AnimatedIcons.menu_arrow,
            progress: AlwaysStoppedAnimation(0.5), // Control the animation progress
            size: 100.0,
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays an animated icon in the center of the screen. The `AnimatedIcon` widget takes an `icon`, a `progress` value to control the animation, and other properties like `size` and `color`.

# Complete Example of flutter_animated_icons

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_animated_icons/flutter_animated_icons.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  // Declare a controller for the animation
  late AnimationController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the animation controller
    _controller = AnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(seconds: 1), // Set the duration of the animation
      vsync: this,
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Animated Icons Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Animated icon that changes based on the controller's value
              AnimatedIcon(
                icon: AnimatedIcons.menu_arrow,
                progress: _controller, // Use the controller to control the animation
                size: 100.0,
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Start the animation when the button is pressed
                  if (_controller.isCompleted) {
                    _controller.reverse(); // Reverse the animation if it's completed
                  } else {
                    _controller.forward(); // Start the animation
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Toggle Animation'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that manages an animation controller.
// In the `initState` method, we initialize the `_controller` with a duration of 1 second.
// The `build` method returns a `MaterialApp` with a `Scaffold` containing an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget.
// Inside the `Center` widget, we have a `Column` that holds an `AnimatedIcon` and an `ElevatedButton`.
// The `AnimatedIcon` uses the `_controller` to control its animation progress.
// When the button is pressed, it toggles the animation: if the animation is completed, it reverses it; otherwise, it starts the animation.
// This creates a smooth transition between the two states of the animated icon, enhancing the user experience.
