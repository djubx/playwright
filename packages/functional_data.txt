Here's a detailed technical blog on the "functional_data" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Functional Data Flutter Package

The **functional_data** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that facilitates the creation of immutable data classes. It leverages the principles of functional programming to enhance code readability, maintainability, and safety. This package is particularly useful when working with complex data structures, as it allows developers to create data models that are easy to manipulate without the risk of unintended side effects.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **functional_data** package in scenarios such as:

- **Immutable Data Models**: When you need to create data models that should not change after they are created, ensuring data integrity.
- **State Management**: In applications where state management is crucial, such as Flutter apps using BLoC or Provider patterns.
- **Complex Data Structures**: When dealing with nested data structures that require clear and concise manipulation.

## Features

- **Immutable Data Classes**: Automatically generates immutable data classes with copy and equality methods.
- **Built-in Serialization**: Supports JSON serialization and deserialization out of the box.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of generated code through annotations.
- **Integration with Dart's `freezed` package**: Works seamlessly with the `freezed` package for even more powerful data modeling.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Functional Data

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **functional_data** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  functional_data: ^7.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Configuring Your Project

### For Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### For iOS

1. Open `ios/Podfile`.
2. Uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Creating a Data Class

Now, let's create a simple data class using the **functional_data** package. Create a new Dart file, e.g., `user.dart`, and define your data class as follows:

```dart
import 'package:functional_data/functional_data.dart';

part 'user.g.dart';

@FunctionalData()
abstract class User extends $User {
  String get name;
  int get age;
}
```

This code defines a `User` class with immutable properties `name` and `age`. The `part` directive is necessary for code generation.

## Step 4: Generating Code

To generate the necessary code, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This will create a `user.g.dart` file containing the generated code for your `User` class.

## Step 5: Using the Data Class

You can now use the `User` class in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create and manipulate a `User` object:

```dart
void main() {
  final user = User((b) => b
    ..name = 'Alice'
    ..age = 30);

  // Create a new user with updated age
  final updatedUser = user.rebuild((b) => b..age = 31);

  print('User: ${user.name}, Age: ${user.age}');
  print('Updated User: ${updatedUser.name}, Age: ${updatedUser.age}');
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create an immutable `User` object and how to create a modified copy of it using the `rebuild` method.

# Complete Example of Functional Data in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:functional_data/functional_data.dart';

// Import the generated file for the User class
part 'user.g.dart';

// Define the User data class
@FunctionalData()
abstract class User extends $User {
  String get name; // Immutable property for user's name
  int get age;    // Immutable property for user's age
}

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Start the Flutter application
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Functional Data Example',
      home: UserScreen(), // Set the home screen to UserScreen
    );
  }
}

class UserScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an immutable User object
    final user = User((b) => b
      ..name = 'Alice' // Set the name property
      ..age = 30);     // Set the age property

    // Create a modified copy of the user with an updated age
    final updatedUser = user.rebuild((b) => b..age = 31);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Functional Data Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('User: ${user.name}, Age: ${user.age}'), // Display original user
            Text('Updated User: ${updatedUser.name}, Age: ${updatedUser.age}'), // Display updated user
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with MyApp().
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets UserScreen as the home widget.
// 3. UserScreen creates an immutable User object with name 'Alice' and age 30.
// 4. It then creates an updated User object with the same name but age 31 using the rebuild method.
// 5. The UI displays both the original and updated user information in the center of the screen.
```
