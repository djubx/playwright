# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_gravatar`

## Step 1: Adding Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_gravatar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_gravatar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_gravatar/flutter_gravatar.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### Basic Usage

You can use the `Gravatar` class to fetch and display an avatar. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
Gravatar gravatar = Gravatar('user@example.com');
String imageUrl = gravatar.imageUrl(size: 200); // Fetches the Gravatar image URL
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` has the necessary permissions to access the internet:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow HTTP requests if you are not using HTTPS:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Customizing the Gravatar

You can customize the Gravatar by specifying parameters such as size and default image. Here’s an example:

```dart
String imageUrl = gravatar.imageUrl(size: 200, defaultImage: 'retro');
```

This will fetch a Gravatar image of size 200 pixels, and if the Gravatar is not found, it will display a retro-style default image.

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_gravatar`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gravatar/flutter_gravatar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gravatar Example',
      home: GravatarExample(),
    );
  }
}

class GravatarExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a Gravatar instance with the user's email
    Gravatar gravatar = Gravatar('user@example.com');

    // Fetch the Gravatar image URL with a specified size
    String imageUrl = gravatar.imageUrl(size: 200, defaultImage: 'retro');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Gravatar Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Display the Gravatar image using Image.network
        child: Image.network(imageUrl),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. GravatarExample is the home widget that displays the Gravatar image.
// 4. Inside GravatarExample, a Gravatar instance is created with a sample email.
// 5. The imageUrl is generated using the Gravatar instance, specifying the size and default image.
// 6. The Scaffold widget provides a structure with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 7. The Gravatar image is displayed in the center of the screen using Image.network, which fetches the image from the generated URL.
