# Flutter Placeholder Textlines Package

The `flutter_placeholder_textlines` package is a useful Flutter library designed to create placeholder text lines that mimic the appearance of loading content. This package is particularly beneficial when building user interfaces that require a loading state, allowing developers to enhance user experience by providing visual feedback while data is being fetched or processed.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_placeholder_textlines` package in scenarios such as:
- **Loading States**: When your application is fetching data from an API, you can use placeholder text lines to indicate that content is on its way.
- **Skeleton Screens**: Instead of showing a spinner, you can create a more visually appealing skeleton screen that resembles the final layout.
- **User Experience**: To improve perceived performance by giving users a sense of progress while they wait for content to load.

## Features

- **Customizable**: You can easily customize the number of lines, their height, and spacing.
- **Flexible**: Works seamlessly with various layouts and can be integrated into existing Flutter applications without hassle.
- **Lightweight**: The package is lightweight and does not add significant overhead to your application.

Overall, `flutter_placeholder_textlines` is a great tool for enhancing the user experience in Flutter applications by providing a visually appealing way to indicate loading states.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_placeholder_textlines

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_placeholder_textlines` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_placeholder_textlines: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the placeholder text lines, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_placeholder_textlines/flutter_placeholder_textlines.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Placeholder Text Lines

You can now use the `PlaceholderTextLines` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
PlaceholderTextLines(
  count: 5, // Number of lines to display
  animate: true, // Enable animation
  lineHeight: 8.0, // Height of each line
  spacing: 4.0, // Space between lines
),
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
  
  ```groovy
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Step 4: Customization Options

You can customize the appearance of the placeholder lines by adjusting the parameters:

- `count`: Number of lines to display.
- `lineHeight`: Height of each line.
- `spacing`: Space between each line.
- `animate`: Whether to enable animation for the placeholder lines.

This flexibility allows you to tailor the loading indicators to fit the design of your application.

# Complete Example of Using flutter_placeholder_textlines

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_placeholder_textlines/flutter_placeholder_textlines.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Placeholder Text Lines Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Placeholder Text Lines'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: PlaceholderExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PlaceholderExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Simulating a loading state
    return FutureBuilder(
      future: fetchData(), // Simulated data fetching
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
          // While data is loading, show placeholder text lines
          return PlaceholderTextLines(
            count: 5, // Display 5 placeholder lines
            animate: true, // Enable animation for a smooth effect
            lineHeight: 8.0, // Set the height of each line
            spacing: 4.0, // Set the spacing between lines
          );
        } else {
          // Once data is loaded, display the actual content
          return Text('Data Loaded Successfully!');
        }
      },
    );
  }

  // Simulated data fetching function
  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3)); // Simulate a network delay
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds the main MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, a PlaceholderExample widget is created.
// 4. The PlaceholderExample uses a FutureBuilder to simulate data fetching.
// 5. While waiting for the data, it displays 5 animated placeholder text lines.
// 6. After a 3-second delay, it shows the message "Data Loaded Successfully!" once the data is fetched.
