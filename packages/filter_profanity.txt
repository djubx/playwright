## Setup Process

To get started with the `filter_profanity` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `filter_profanity` package under dependencies.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     filter_profanity: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
   - **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

## Using the Package

### Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:filter_profanity/filter_profanity.dart';
```

### Basic Usage

Here’s how to use the `filter_profanity` package in your Flutter application:

1. **Initialize the Profanity Filter**:

   ```dart
   final profanityFilter = FilterProfanity();
   ```

2. **Filter Text**:

   You can filter a string for profanity as follows:

   ```dart
   String filteredText = profanityFilter.censor("This is a damn test.");
   print(filteredText); // Output: This is a **** test.
   ```

3. **Custom Profanity List**:

   You can customize the profanity list by adding or removing words:

   ```dart
   profanityFilter.addProfanity("damn");
   profanityFilter.removeProfanity("test");
   ```

### Real-time Filtering Example

To implement real-time filtering, you can use a `TextField` widget:

```dart
TextField(
  onChanged: (text) {
    String filteredText = profanityFilter.censor(text);
    // Update your UI with the filtered text
  },
)
```

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate the `filter_profanity` package into your Flutter application, ensuring that user-generated content remains appropriate and respectful.

# Complete Example

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `filter_profanity` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:filter_profanity/filter_profanity.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Profanity Filter Example',
      home: ProfanityFilterScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ProfanityFilterScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ProfanityFilterScreenState createState() => _ProfanityFilterScreenState();
}

class _ProfanityFilterScreenState extends State<ProfanityFilterScreen> {
  final FilterProfanity _profanityFilter = FilterProfanity();
  String _filteredText = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Profanity Filter Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              onChanged: (text) {
                // Filter the text in real-time
                setState(() {
                  _filteredText = _profanityFilter.censor(text);
                });
              },
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Type something',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              'Filtered Text:',
              style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            Text(_filteredText), // Display the filtered text
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and its title.
// 3. The home of the app is set to ProfanityFilterScreen, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In the ProfanityFilterScreen, we initialize the FilterProfanity instance.
// 5. The build method creates a TextField for user input and a Text widget to display the filtered output.
// 6. As the user types in the TextField, the onChanged callback is triggered, filtering the input text in real-time.
// 7. The filtered text is updated in the state and displayed below the TextField.
```
