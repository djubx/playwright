# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `linkify_plus`

## Installation
To get started with `linkify_plus`, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  linkify_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/linkify_plus).

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the following in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

This ensures compatibility with the latest iOS features.

## Using `linkify_plus`
To use `linkify_plus`, you can create a simple widget that takes a string input and displays it with linkified text. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:linkify_plus/linkify_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Linkify Plus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Linkify(
            text: 'Check out https://flutter.dev and email me at example@example.com #Flutter',
            onOpen: (link) async {
              // Handle link opening
              print('Opening link: ${link.url}');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() => runApp(RealFlutter());
```

In this example, the `Linkify` widget takes a string and automatically converts any detected links into clickable elements. The `onOpen` callback allows you to define what happens when a link is clicked.

# Complete Example of `linkify_plus`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:linkify_plus/linkify_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Linkify Plus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Linkify(
            text: 'Check out https://flutter.dev and email me at example@example.com #Flutter',
            onOpen: (link) async {
              // Handle link opening
              print('Opening link: ${link.url}');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() => runApp(RealFlutter());
```

// The above code defines a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the linkify_plus package.
// 
// 1. **Imports**: The necessary packages are imported at the beginning. `flutter/material.dart` is for the Flutter framework, and `linkify_plus/linkify_plus.dart` is for the linkify functionality.
// 
// 2. **RealFlutter Class**: This is the main widget of the application, extending StatelessWidget. It builds the UI of the app.
// 
// 3. **MaterialApp**: The app is wrapped in a MaterialApp widget, which provides material design styling.
// 
// 4. **Scaffold**: A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout structure, including an AppBar and a body.
// 
// 5. **Linkify Widget**: The Linkify widget is used to display the text. It automatically detects links, emails, and hashtags in the provided string.
// 
// 6. **onOpen Callback**: The onOpen callback is triggered when a link is clicked. In this example, it simply prints the link URL to the console, but you can customize this to open the link in a browser or handle it as needed.
// 
// 7. **Main Function**: The main function runs the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 
// This example showcases how easy it is to integrate link detection and interaction into your Flutter applications using the linkify_plus package.
