# Flutter Dynamic Icon Package: An Overview

The `flutter_dynamic_icon` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance their app's user experience by allowing dynamic changes to the app icon. This package is particularly useful for applications that want to reflect real-time data or events directly on the app icon, such as displaying a notification count, changing the icon for special events, or personalizing the app icon based on user preferences.

## When to Use `flutter_dynamic_icon`

- **Event-Based Icon Changes**: Change the app icon to reflect special events or holidays.
- **Notification Indicators**: Display a badge or change the icon to indicate unread notifications.
- **User Personalization**: Allow users to select their preferred app icon from a set of options.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both iOS and Android, with platform-specific configurations.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for changing app icons dynamically.
- **Customizable**: Supports multiple icon sets for different scenarios.

# Setting Up and Using `flutter_dynamic_icon`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_dynamic_icon` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `flutter_dynamic_icon` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_dynamic_icon: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### iOS Configuration

1. **Add Alternate Icons**: In your iOS project, navigate to `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets`. Add new icon sets for each alternate icon you want to use. Each icon set should be named according to the icon's role.

2. **Update Info.plist**: Add the `CFBundleIcons` key to your `Info.plist` file to define the alternate icons:

```xml
<key>CFBundleIcons</key>
<dict>
  <key>CFBundlePrimaryIcon</key>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleIconFiles</key>
    <array>
      <string>AppIcon</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
  <key>CFBundleAlternateIcons</key>
  <dict>
    <key>AlternateIcon1</key>
    <dict>
      <key>CFBundleIconFiles</key>
      <array>
        <string>AlternateIcon1</string>
      </array>
    </dict>
    <!-- Add more alternate icons as needed -->
  </dict>
</dict>
```

#### Android Configuration

1. **Add Alternate Icons**: Create alternate icon resources in the `android/app/src/main/res` directory. Each icon should be placed in the appropriate drawable folder (e.g., `drawable-hdpi`, `drawable-mdpi`).

2. **Manifest Configuration**: No additional configuration is required in the `AndroidManifest.xml` for dynamic icons on Android, as the package handles this internally.

## Using the Package

To change the app icon, use the `RealFlutter` class provided by the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_dynamic_icon/flutter_dynamic_icon.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  Future<void> changeIcon(String iconName) async {
    bool success = await FlutterDynamicIcon.setAlternateIconName(iconName);
    if (success) {
      print("App icon changed successfully.");
    } else {
      print("Failed to change app icon.");
    }
  }
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_dynamic_icon/flutter_dynamic_icon.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Dynamic Icon Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: IconChangerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class IconChangerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _IconChangerScreenState createState() => _IconChangerScreenState();
}

class _IconChangerScreenState extends State<IconChangerScreen> {
  final RealFlutter _realFlutter = RealFlutter();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dynamic Icon Changer'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _changeIcon('AlternateIcon1'),
              child: Text('Change to Alternate Icon 1'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _changeIcon(null),
              child: Text('Revert to Default Icon'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _changeIcon(String? iconName) async {
    // Attempt to change the app icon using the RealFlutter class
    bool success = await FlutterDynamicIcon.setAlternateIconName(iconName);
    // Check if the icon change was successful
    if (success) {
      // Notify the user of the successful icon change
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Icon changed successfully!')),
      );
    } else {
      // Notify the user of the failure to change the icon
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Failed to change icon.')),
      );
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and home screen.
// 3. IconChangerScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the icon change feature.
// 4. The build method of IconChangerScreen creates a UI with two buttons for changing the icon.
// 5. When a button is pressed, the _changeIcon method is called with the appropriate icon name.
// 6. The _changeIcon method uses the FlutterDynamicIcon package to attempt to change the app icon.
// 7. A SnackBar is displayed to inform the user whether the icon change was successful or not.
