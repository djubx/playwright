# Setting Up and Using htkc_utils

## Installation

To add the `htkc_utils` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  htkc_utils: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/htkc_utils).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using htkc_utils

Once the package is installed, you can start using its features. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use some of the utilities provided by `htkc_utils`:

```dart
import 'package:htkc_utils/htkc_utils.dart';

void main() {
  // Example of string manipulation
  String original = "  Hello, Flutter!  ";
  String trimmed = StringUtils.trim(original);
  print(trimmed); // Output: "Hello, Flutter!"

  // Example of date formatting
  DateTime now = DateTime.now();
  String formattedDate = DateUtils.formatDate(now);
  print(formattedDate); // Output: "MM/DD/YYYY" format
}
```

This example demonstrates how to import the package and utilize its string and date utilities effectively.

# Complete Example of htkc_utils in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:htkc_utils/htkc_utils.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'htkc_utils Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('htkc_utils Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Original string with extra spaces
              Text('Original: "  Hello, Flutter!  "'),
              // Using StringUtils to trim the string
              Text('Trimmed: "${StringUtils.trim("  Hello, Flutter!  ")}"'),
              // Current date
              Text('Current Date: ${DateUtils.formatDate(DateTime.now())}'),
              // Validating an email
              Text('Is valid email: ${ValidationUtils.isEmailValid("example@domain.com") ? "Yes" : "No"}'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to display multiple Text widgets.
// 5. The first Text widget shows the original string with spaces.
// 6. The second Text widget uses StringUtils to trim the original string and display the result.
// 7. The third Text widget formats and displays the current date using DateUtils.
// 8. The fourth Text widget validates an email address using ValidationUtils and displays whether it is valid or not.
