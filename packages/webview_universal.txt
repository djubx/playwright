# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `webview_universal`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `webview_universal` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `webview_universal` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  webview_universal: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_universal).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries to allow arbitrary loads:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a web view using the `webview_universal` package.

# Complete Example: Using `webview_universal`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:webview_universal/webview_universal.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Webview Universal Example',
      home: WebViewExample(),
    );
  }
}

class WebViewExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WebViewExampleState createState() => _WebViewExampleState();
}

class _WebViewExampleState extends State<WebViewExample> {
  // Controller to manage the web view
  late WebViewController _controller;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Webview Universal Example'),
        // Navigation controls
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_back),
            onPressed: () {
              // Go back in web view history
              _controller.goBack();
            },
          ),
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),
            onPressed: () {
              // Go forward in web view history
              _controller.goForward();
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: WebView(
        initialUrl: 'https://flutter.dev', // Initial URL to load
        onWebViewCreated: (WebViewController controller) {
          // Assign the controller to manage the web view
          _controller = controller;
        },
        onPageFinished: (String url) {
          // Callback when the page finishes loading
          print('Page finished loading: $url');
        },
        javascriptMode: JavascriptMode.unrestricted, // Enable JavaScript
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page (WebViewExample).
// 3. WebViewExample is a stateful widget that manages the web view state.
// 4. The AppBar contains navigation buttons for back and forward actions.
// 5. The WebView widget is initialized with a URL (https://flutter.dev).
// 6. The onWebViewCreated callback assigns the WebViewController to manage the web view.
// 7. The onPageFinished callback logs the URL when the page finishes loading.
// 8. JavaScript is enabled for the web view to allow dynamic content.
```

// The above code demonstrates how to set up a simple Flutter application using the `webview_universal` package. The application consists of a web view that loads the Flutter website. The AppBar includes navigation buttons to go back and forward in the web view's history. The WebViewController is used to manage the web view's state and actions, such as loading URLs and executing JavaScript.

In summary, this blog provided an overview of the `webview_universal` package, a step-by-step tutorial for setting it up, and a complete example demonstrating its usage. By following these guidelines, you can effectively integrate web views into your Flutter applications, enhancing their functionality and user experience.
