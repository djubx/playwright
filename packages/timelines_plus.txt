# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Timelines Plus

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **timelines_plus** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  timelines_plus: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the timeline, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:timelines_plus/timelines_plus.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Timeline Widget

You can now use the `RealFlutter` class to create a timeline. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timelines_plus/timelines_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Timelines Plus Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Timeline.tileBuilder(
          theme: TimelineThemeData(
            nodePosition: 0.2,
            connectorTheme: ConnectorThemeData(
              thickness: 2.0,
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
          ),
          builder: TimelineTileBuilder.connected(
            itemCount: 5,
            contentsBuilder: (context, index) => Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
              child: Text('Event $index'),
            ),
            indicatorBuilder: (context, index) => DotIndicator(
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Text('$index'),
            ),
            connectorBuilder: (context, index, connectorType) {
              return SolidLineConnector(
                color: Colors.blue,
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic timeline with five events, each represented by a dot and a label.

# Complete Example of Timelines Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:timelines_plus/timelines_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Timelines Plus Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Timelines Plus Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Timeline.tileBuilder(
          theme: TimelineThemeData(
            nodePosition: 0.2, // Position of the nodes
            connectorTheme: ConnectorThemeData(
              thickness: 2.0, // Thickness of the connector line
              color: Colors.blue, // Color of the connector line
            ),
          ),
          builder: TimelineTileBuilder.connected(
            itemCount: 5, // Number of events in the timeline
            contentsBuilder: (context, index) => Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
              child: Text('Event $index'), // Content for each event
            ),
            indicatorBuilder: (context, index) => DotIndicator(
              color: Colors.blue, // Color of the dot indicator
              child: Text('$index'), // Display index as the dot's child
            ),
            connectorBuilder: (context, index, connectorType) {
              return SolidLineConnector(
                color: Colors.blue, // Color of the connector line
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Timeline is created using the Timeline.tileBuilder method.
// 5. The timeline is configured with a theme, including node position and connector styles.
// 6. The builder creates a connected timeline with 5 events, each displaying its index.
// 7. The DotIndicator shows a blue dot for each event, and the SolidLineConnector connects the dots with a blue line.
