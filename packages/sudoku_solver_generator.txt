   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart files, import the package to start using it:

   ```dart
   import 'package:sudoku_solver_generator/sudoku_solver_generator.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to generate and solve a Sudoku puzzle:

```dart
// Create an instance of the Sudoku generator
final sudokuGenerator = SudokuGenerator();

// Generate a new Sudoku puzzle
final puzzle = sudokuGenerator.generatePuzzle(difficulty: Difficulty.easy);

// Solve the generated puzzle
final solution = sudokuGenerator.solvePuzzle(puzzle);
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a Sudoku puzzle and solve it using the package's methods. You can adjust the difficulty level as needed.

# Complete Example

Below is a complete Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `sudoku_solver_generator` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sudoku_solver_generator/sudoku_solver_generator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sudoku Solver',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: SudokuHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class SudokuHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SudokuHomePageState createState() => _SudokuHomePageState();
}

class _SudokuHomePageState extends State<SudokuHomePage> {
  late List<List<int>> puzzle; // 2D list to hold the Sudoku puzzle
  late List<List<int>> solution; // 2D list to hold the solved Sudoku puzzle
  final SudokuGenerator sudokuGenerator = SudokuGenerator();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    generatePuzzle(); // Generate a new puzzle when the app starts
  }

  void generatePuzzle() {
    // Generate a new Sudoku puzzle of easy difficulty
    puzzle = sudokuGenerator.generatePuzzle(difficulty: Difficulty.easy);
    solution = sudokuGenerator.solvePuzzle(puzzle); // Solve the generated puzzle
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sudoku Solver'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.refresh),
            onPressed: generatePuzzle, // Regenerate puzzle on button press
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Sudoku Puzzle:', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            buildSudokuGrid(puzzle), // Display the generated puzzle
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Solved Puzzle:', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            buildSudokuGrid(solution), // Display the solved puzzle
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Widget buildSudokuGrid(List<List<int>> grid) {
    // Build a grid of Sudoku cells
    return Column(
      children: grid.map((row) {
        return Row(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: row.map((cell) {
            return Container(
              width: 40,
              height: 40,
              margin: EdgeInsets.all(2),
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                border: Border.all(),
                color: Colors.white,
              ),
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  cell == 0 ? '' : cell.toString(), // Display cell value
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            );
          }).toList(),
        );
      }).toList(),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home page is set to SudokuHomePage, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In the _SudokuHomePageState, we initialize the Sudoku generator and generate a puzzle in initState.
// 5. The generatePuzzle method creates a new puzzle and its solution, updating the UI.
// 6. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the puzzle and its solution in a grid format.
// 7. The user can regenerate the puzzle by pressing the refresh button in the app bar.
```
