# GLEAP_SDK Flutter Package

The `gleap_sdk` is a powerful Flutter package designed to enhance user engagement and feedback collection within mobile applications. It provides developers with tools to integrate in-app feedback, bug reporting, and user analytics seamlessly. This package is particularly useful for applications that require constant user interaction and feedback to improve their services.

## When to Use GLEAP_SDK

- **User Feedback Collection**: If your app needs to gather user opinions or suggestions, GLEAP_SDK provides an easy way to implement feedback forms.
- **Bug Reporting**: For applications that may encounter bugs or issues, this package allows users to report problems directly, including screenshots and device information.
- **User Engagement**: Enhance user experience by integrating features that encourage users to interact with your app more frequently.

## Features

- **In-App Feedback**: Collect user feedback without leaving the app.
- **Bug Reporting**: Users can report bugs with detailed information.
- **User Analytics**: Track user interactions and behaviors to improve app performance.
- **Customizable UI**: The package allows customization of the feedback forms to match your app's design.

By integrating the `gleap_sdk`, developers can significantly improve the quality of their applications through direct user input and analytics.

# Tutorial: Setting Up GLEAP_SDK

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `gleap_sdk` package in a Flutter application. We will cover both Android and iOS configurations.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `gleap_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gleap_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

2. **Initialize GLEAP_SDK**: In your `MainActivity.java` or `MainActivity.kt`, initialize the GLEAP SDK in the `onCreate` method:

   ```java
   import com.gleap.sdk.Gleap;

   @Override
   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
       Gleap.initialize(this, "YOUR_GLEAP_API_KEY");
   }
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_GLEAP_API_KEY` with your actual GLEAP API key.

## Step 3: iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Initialize GLEAP_SDK**: In your `AppDelegate.swift`, initialize the GLEAP SDK:

   ```swift
   import UIKit
   import Gleap

   @UIApplicationMain
   class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
       func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
           Gleap.initialize("YOUR_GLEAP_API_KEY")
           return true
       }
   }
   ```

   Again, replace `YOUR_GLEAP_API_KEY` with your actual GLEAP API key.

## Step 4: Using GLEAP_SDK in Your Flutter App

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to trigger feedback and bug reporting:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gleap_sdk/gleap_sdk.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('GLEAP SDK Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              Gleap.showFeedback();
            },
            child: Text('Give Feedback'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the user taps the "Give Feedback" button, the feedback form will be displayed.

# Complete Example of GLEAP_SDK

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gleap_sdk/gleap_sdk.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('GLEAP SDK Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Trigger the feedback form
                  Gleap.showFeedback();
                },
                child: Text('Give Feedback'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Trigger bug reporting
                  Gleap.showBugReport();
                },
                child: Text('Report a Bug'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // Run the RealFlutter application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, there are two ElevatedButtons:
//    - The first button triggers the feedback form when pressed, allowing users to submit their feedback.
//    - The second button triggers the bug reporting form, enabling users to report any issues they encounter.
// 4. Both buttons utilize the Gleap SDK methods to display the respective forms, enhancing user engagement and feedback collection.
```

In summary, the `gleap_sdk` Flutter package provides a robust solution for collecting user feedback and reporting bugs directly within your application. By following the setup and usage instructions outlined in this blog, you can easily integrate GLEAP into your Flutter app, enhancing user experience and engagement.
