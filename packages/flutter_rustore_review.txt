## Usage
To use the package, you can call the `requestReview` method from the `RealFlutter` class. Hereâ€™s how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_rustore_review/flutter_rustore_review.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Review Prompt Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Request a review from the user
              await FlutterRustoreReview.requestReview;
            },
            child: Text('Leave a Review'),
          ),
        ),

# Complete Example of flutter_rustore_review

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_rustore_review/flutter_rustore_review.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Review Prompt Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // This function is called when the button is pressed
              // It requests a review from the user
              await FlutterRustoreReview.requestReview;
            },
            child: Text('Leave a Review'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. Inside the callback, the requestReview method from the flutter_rustore_review package is called.
// 6. This prompts the user to leave a review for the app, enhancing user engagement and feedback collection.
