# Complete Example of Using the Balloon Tip Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:balloon_tip/balloon_tip.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Balloon Tip Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Balloon Tip Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: BalloonTipExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class BalloonTipExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Creating a button that will show a balloon tip when pressed
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the balloon tip when the button is pressed
            showBalloonTip(context);
          },
          child: Text('Show Balloon Tip'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }

  void showBalloonTip(BuildContext context) {
    // Displaying the balloon tip
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
        return AlertDialog(
          content: BalloonTip(
            child: Text('This is a balloon tip!'),
            balloon: Balloon(
              child: Text('Here is some additional information.'),
            ),
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered body.
// 3. The BalloonTipExample widget is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 4. When the "Show Balloon Tip" button is pressed, the showBalloonTip method is called.
// 5. The showBalloonTip method displays an AlertDialog containing the BalloonTip widget.
// 6. The BalloonTip widget shows a message and provides additional information in a balloon format.
