# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Advance Math Package

## Step 1: Adding the Package to Your Project

To get started with the **advance_math** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  advance_math: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:advance_math/advance_math.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the functions provided by the **advance_math** package. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use some of its features:

```dart
void main() {
  double angle = 45.0;
  double sineValue = sin(degToRad(angle)); // Convert degrees to radians
  double logValue = log(100); // Natural logarithm
  print('Sine of $angle degrees: $sineValue');
  print('Natural log of 100: $logValue');
}
```

This example demonstrates how to calculate the sine of an angle and the natural logarithm of a number using the **advance_math** package.

# Complete Example of Using the Advance Math Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:advance_math/advance_math.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Advance Math Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Advance Math Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: MathOperations(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MathOperations extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define an angle in degrees
    double angle = 45.0;

    // Calculate sine, cosine, and tangent of the angle
    double sineValue = sin(degToRad(angle)); // Convert degrees to radians
    double cosineValue = cos(degToRad(angle));
    double tangentValue = tan(degToRad(angle));

    // Calculate the natural logarithm of a number
    double logValue = log(100); // Natural logarithm

    // Display the results
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Sine of $angle degrees: $sineValue'),
        Text('Cosine of $angle degrees: $cosineValue'),
        Text('Tangent of $angle degrees: $tangentValue'),
        Text('Natural log of 100: $logValue'),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the MathOperations widget.
// 4. The MathOperations widget calculates the sine, cosine, and tangent of a specified angle (45 degrees) and the natural logarithm of 100.
// 5. The results are displayed in a column format in the center of the screen.
```
