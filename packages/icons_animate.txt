### Tutorial
To get started with `icons_animate`, follow these steps:

1. Add the `icons_animate` package to your Flutter project by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml

```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the `icons_animate` package in your Dart file:

```
5. Customize the animation by passing in additional properties, such as the animation duration and delay:

      icon: Icons.favorite,
      animationType: AnimationType.fade,
    ),
    Text('Favorite'),

// This is the main file of the application.
// It creates a Material app with a home page that demonstrates the usage of the IconsAnimate widget.
// The home page has three sections, each showcasing a different animation type: fade, scale, and rotate.
// Each section has an IconsAnimate widget and a Text widget to describe the animation type.
// The IconsAnimate widget is customized with a duration and delay to control the animation.
// The application uses a Scaffold to provide a basic Material design layout.
// The body of the Scaffold is a Center widget that contains a Column widget.
// The Column widget has three children, each containing an IconsAnimate widget and a Text widget.
// The application runs on a MaterialApp, which provides a Material design theme to the application.
