// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, and the `MyApp` widget is created.
// 2. The `MyApp` widget builds a `MaterialApp` with a `RealFlutter` widget as its home.
// 3. The `RealFlutter` widget creates a `Scaffold` with a centered `Column`.
// 4. The `Column` contains two `Rotation3DEffect` widgets, each rotating a different child widget (a `Text` widget and an `Icon` widget).
// 5. The `Rotation3DEffect` widgets rotate their child widgets based on the specified rotation angle, duration, and curve.
// 6. The user can adjust the rotation angle, duration, and curve to customize the rotation effect.
