class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('3D Rotation Effect')),
        body: Center(
          child: Rotation3DEffect(
            angle: 45, // Set the rotation angle
            duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Set the duration of the animation
            child: Container(
              width: 200,
              height: 200,
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(child: Text('Rotate Me!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
            ),
          ),

# Complete Example of Using the Rotation Three D Effect Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rotation_three_d_effect/rotation_three_d_effect.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('3D Rotation Effect')),
        body: Center(
          // Wrapping the Container with Rotation3DEffect
          child: Rotation3DEffect(
            angle: 45, // Setting the rotation angle to 45 degrees
            duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Animation duration of 1 second
            child: Container(
              width: 200, // Width of the container
              height: 200, // Height of the container
              color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the container
              child: Center(
                // Centering the text inside the container
                child: Text(
                  'Rotate Me!', // Text to display
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white), // Text color
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with RealFlutter as the root widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, the Rotation3DEffect widget is used to wrap a Container.
// 4. The Container is styled with a blue background and contains centered text "Rotate Me!".
// 5. The Rotation3DEffect applies a 3D rotation to the Container with a specified angle and duration, creating an engaging visual effect.
