# Utopia Hooks: A Comprehensive Overview

The **utopia_hooks** package is a powerful state management solution for Flutter applications, inspired by React's hooks. It allows developers to manage state in a more functional and declarative way, making it easier to build complex UIs with less boilerplate code. This package is particularly useful when you want to separate your UI from business logic, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

## When to Use Utopia Hooks
- **State Management**: When your application has complex state that needs to be shared across multiple widgets.
- **Performance Optimization**: If you want to optimize widget rebuilds and improve performance.
- **Functional Programming**: If you prefer a functional programming style and want to leverage hooks for managing state and side effects.

## Key Features
- **Declarative API**: Use hooks to manage state and lifecycle events in a more intuitive way.
- **Reactivity**: Automatically re-renders widgets when the state changes.
- **Custom Hooks**: Create your own hooks to encapsulate reusable logic.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead compared to other state management solutions.

# Utopia Hooks: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the **utopia_hooks** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  utopia_hooks: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/utopia_hooks).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use **utopia_hooks**, you need to import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:utopia_hooks/utopia_hooks.dart';
```

You can then create a simple hook-based widget. Hereâ€™s an example of a counter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:utopia_hooks/utopia_hooks.dart';

class CounterWidget extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Using the useState hook to manage the counter state
    final count = useState(0);

    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Count: ${count.value}'),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => count.value++, // Increment the counter
          child: Text('Increment'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, `useState` is used to create a state variable `count`, which is automatically updated when the button is pressed.

# Complete Example of Utopia Hooks in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:utopia_hooks/utopia_hooks.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Using the useState hook to manage the counter state
    final count = useState(0); // Initialize the state variable

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Utopia Hooks Example'), // App title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('Count: ${count.value}'), // Display the current count
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  count.value++; // Increment the counter when pressed
                },
                child: Text('Increment'), // Button label
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  count.value = 0; // Reset the counter when pressed
                },
                child: Text('Reset'), // Button label
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a HookWidget that uses the useState hook to manage the count state.
// 3. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the current count and two buttons.
// 4. When the "Increment" button is pressed, the count state is increased by 1.
// 5. When the "Reset" button is pressed, the count state is reset to 0.
// 6. The UI automatically updates to reflect the current count due to the reactive nature of hooks.
