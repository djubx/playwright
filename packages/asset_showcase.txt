// 2. The RealFlutter widget creates a list of assets to display.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget creates an AssetShowcase widget and passes the list of assets to it.
// 4. The AssetShowcase widget displays the assets in a grid layout.
// 5. The user can interact with the assets by tapping on them.
// 6. The AssetShowcase widget handles the asset interaction and displays the asset details.
