# Setting Up and Using altfire_configurator

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `altfire_configurator` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the `altfire_configurator` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  altfire_configurator: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/altfire_configurator).

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if your configurations require network access or other specific features.

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow for specific settings or permissions based on your app's requirements.

## Basic Usage

To use the `altfire_configurator`, you will typically follow these steps:

1. **Import the Package**:
   ```dart
   import 'package:altfire_configurator/altfire_configurator.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize the Configurator**:
   You can initialize the configurator in your main application file or wherever appropriate.
   ```dart
   void main() {
     AltFireConfigurator.initialize();
     runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```

3. **Define Configurations**:
   You can define your configurations using a simple key-value pair structure.
   ```dart
   AltFireConfigurator.setConfig('theme', 'dark');
   ```

4. **Retrieve Configurations**:
   To retrieve a configuration, use:
   ```dart
   String theme = AltFireConfigurator.getConfig('theme');
   ```

5. **Listen for Changes**:
   You can listen for changes in configurations to update your UI dynamically.
   ```dart
   AltFireConfigurator.onConfigChange.listen((config) {
     // Update your UI based on the new configuration
   });
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively manage dynamic configurations in your Flutter application using the `altfire_configurator` package.

# Complete Example of altfire_configurator

Here is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `altfire_configurator` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:altfire_configurator/altfire_configurator.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the AltFireConfigurator
  AltFireConfigurator.initialize();
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String theme = 'light'; // Default theme

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Set initial configuration
    AltFireConfigurator.setConfig('theme', theme);

    // Listen for configuration changes
    AltFireConfigurator.onConfigChange.listen((config) {
      // Update the theme based on the configuration
      setState(() {
        theme = config['theme'] ?? 'light'; // Fallback to light if not set
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build the UI based on the current theme
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AltFire Configurator Demo',
      theme: theme == 'dark' ? ThemeData.dark() : ThemeData.light(),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('AltFire Configurator Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Current Theme: $theme'),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Toggle theme between light and dark
                  String newTheme = theme == 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark';
                  AltFireConfigurator.setConfig('theme', newTheme);
                },
                child: Text('Toggle Theme'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts by initializing the AltFireConfigurator in the main function.
// The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget to manage state.
// In the initState method, we set the initial theme configuration to 'light'.
// We also set up a listener for configuration changes, which updates the theme state when a change occurs.
// The build method constructs the UI based on the current theme.
// The MaterialApp widget is used to apply the theme, and a button is provided to toggle between light and dark themes.
// When the button is pressed, the theme configuration is updated, triggering the listener to rebuild the UI with the new theme.
