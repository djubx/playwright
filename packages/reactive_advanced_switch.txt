# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `reactive_advanced_switch`

## Installation
To use the `reactive_advanced_switch` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  reactive_advanced_switch: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your toggle switch interacts with system settings.

## Basic Usage
To use the `reactive_advanced_switch`, you can import the package and create a simple toggle switch in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reactive_advanced_switch/reactive_advanced_switch.dart';

class MySwitchWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ReactiveAdvancedSwitch(
      value: false, // Initial value
      onChanged: (value) {
        // Handle the toggle change
        print('Switch is now: $value');
      },
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a basic toggle switch that prints the current state to the console whenever it is toggled.

# Complete Example of `reactive_advanced_switch`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reactive_advanced_switch/reactive_advanced_switch.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Reactive Advanced Switch Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Reactive Advanced Switch Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: MySwitchWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MySwitchWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MySwitchWidgetState createState() => _MySwitchWidgetState();
}

class _MySwitchWidgetState extends State<MySwitchWidget> {
  bool _isSwitched = false; // State variable to hold the switch state

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the current state of the switch
        Text(
          'Switch is ${_isSwitched ? "ON" : "OFF"}',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space
        // Create the reactive switch
        ReactiveAdvancedSwitch(
          value: _isSwitched, // Bind the switch to the state variable
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              _isSwitched = value; // Update the state variable
            });
            // Print the new state to the console
            print('Switch is now: $_isSwitched');
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the app, initializing the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds MySwitchWidget.
// 4. MySwitchWidget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the switch.
// 5. The current state of the switch is displayed as text above the switch.
// 6. When the switch is toggled, the onChanged callback updates the state variable and triggers a rebuild.
// 7. The updated state is printed to the console, reflecting the current status of the switch.
