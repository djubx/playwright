This package allows users to pick images, videos, and other media files from their device's gallery or file system, making it an essential component for apps that require media uploads or selections.

## When to Use `assets_picker`
You might consider using `assets_picker` in scenarios such as:
- Building a social media app where users can upload images or videos.
- Creating a photo gallery application that allows users to select multiple images.
- Developing a file management app that requires users to pick files from their device.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Selection**: Users can select multiple assets at once.
- **Image and Video Support**: Supports both images and videos, allowing for versatile media handling.
- **Customizable UI**: Offers options to customize the appearance of the picker.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, `assets_picker` provides a comprehensive solution for asset selection in Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the `assets_picker` Package

## Installation
To get started with `assets_picker`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  assets_picker: ^4.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for accessing the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save images to your photo library.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `assets_picker`, you can create a simple function to pick assets. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:assets_picker/assets_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Assets Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Open the asset picker
              final List<AssetEntity>? result = await AssetsPicker.pickAssets(
                context,
                maxAssets: 9, // Limit the number of assets to select
                requestType: AssetsType.image, // Specify the type of assets
              );

              // Handle the selected assets
              if (result != null) {
                // Process the selected assets
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pick Assets'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application with a button that opens the asset picker when pressed. The user can select images, and the selected assets can be processed as needed.

# Complete Example of Using `assets_picker`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:assets_picker/assets_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Assets Picker Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Open the asset picker
              final List<AssetEntity>? result = await AssetsPicker.pickAssets(
                context,
                maxAssets: 9, // Limit the number of assets to select
                requestType: AssetsType.image, // Specify the type of assets
              );

              // Check if any assets were selected
              if (result != null) {
                // Loop through the selected assets
                for (var asset in result) {
                  // Get the image or video file
                  final file = await asset.file;
                  // Here you can use the file (e.g., upload it, display it, etc.)
                }
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pick Assets'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The app starts with a MaterialApp widget that contains a Scaffold.
// 2. An AppBar is created with the title 'Assets Picker Example'.
// 3. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. An ElevatedButton is displayed, which, when pressed, triggers the asset picker.
// 5. The asset picker allows the user to select up to 9 images from their device.
// 6. If the user selects assets, the app loops through each selected asset.
// 7. For each asset, it retrieves the corresponding file, which can then be used as needed (e.g., uploaded or displayed).
// 8. This simple flow demonstrates how to integrate the assets_picker package into a Flutter application.
