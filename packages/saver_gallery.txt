# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Saver Gallery

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **saver_gallery** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **saver_gallery** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  saver_gallery: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/saver_gallery).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, you need to add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the photo library to save images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to save an image to the gallery.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:saver_gallery/saver_gallery.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Saver Gallery Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Replace with your image URL or asset
              String imageUrl = 'https://example.com/image.png';
              // Save the image to the gallery
              await SaverGallery.saveImage(imageUrl);
            },
            child: Text('Save Image'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the specified image will be saved to the device's gallery.

# Complete Example of Saver Gallery

Below is a complete Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the **saver_gallery** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:saver_gallery/saver_gallery.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Saver Gallery Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the image URL to be saved
              String imageUrl = 'https://example.com/image.png';
              try {
                // Attempt to save the image to the gallery
                await SaverGallery.saveImage(imageUrl);
                // Show a success message
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Image saved to gallery!')),
                );
              } catch (e) {
                // Handle any errors that occur during the saving process
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Failed to save image: $e')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Save Image'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback.
// 5. Inside the callback, the image URL is defined, and an attempt is made to save the image using SaverGallery.saveImage().
// 6. If the image is saved successfully, a SnackBar displays a success message.
// 7. If an error occurs, it is caught, and a SnackBar displays the error message.
```
