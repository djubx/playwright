# Setting Up the `widget_toolkit` Package

To get started with the `widget_toolkit` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `widget_toolkit` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  widget_toolkit: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

### Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### For Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### For iOS

1. Open `ios/Podfile`.
2. Uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart files, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:widget_toolkit/widget_toolkit.dart';
```

### Step 5: Using the Package

You can now start using the widgets provided by the `widget_toolkit`. For example, to create a custom button, you can use:

```dart
CustomButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  label: 'Click Me',
);
```

# Complete Example of Using `widget_toolkit`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_toolkit/widget_toolkit.dart'; // Importing the widget_toolkit package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Widget Toolkit Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(), // Setting the home page of the app
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Widget Toolkit Demo'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Using a CustomButton from the widget_toolkit
            CustomButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
                );
              },
              label: 'Press Me', // Button label
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
            // Using a CustomCard from the widget_toolkit
            CustomCard(
              title: 'Card Title',
              content: 'This is a card from the widget toolkit.',
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomePage widget is set as the home of the app.
// 4. HomePage contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the CustomButton and CustomCard vertically.
// 6. When the CustomButton is pressed, a SnackBar is displayed to inform the user.
// 7. The CustomCard displays a title and content, showcasing another widget from the toolkit.
```
