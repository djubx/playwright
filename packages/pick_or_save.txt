<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for accessing the photo library:

```xml

```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured the necessary permissions, you can start using it in your Flutter application.

### Basic Usage Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `pick_or_save` package to pick an image and save it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pick_or_save/pick_or_save.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pick or Save Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Pick an image from the gallery
              final pickedFile = await PickOrSave.pickImage();
              if (pickedFile != null) {
                // Save the picked image to the gallery
                await PickOrSave.saveImage(pickedFile.path);
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Image saved successfully!')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pick and Save Image'),
          ),
        ),
      ),

# Complete Example of `pick_or_save`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pick_or_save/pick_or_save.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pick or Save Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Step 1: Pick an image from the gallery
              final pickedFile = await PickOrSave.pickImage();
              if (pickedFile != null) {
                // Step 2: Save the picked image to the gallery
                await PickOrSave.saveImage(pickedFile.path);
                // Step 3: Show a success message
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Image saved successfully!')),
                );
              } else {
                // Step 4: Handle the case where no image was picked
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('No image selected.')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pick and Save Image'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// Inside the `build` method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds an ElevatedButton.
// When the button is pressed, the app calls `PickOrSave.pickImage()` to open the image picker.
// If the user selects an image, the path of the image is returned and stored in `pickedFile`.
// The app then calls `PickOrSave.saveImage(pickedFile.path)` to save the image to the gallery.
// A SnackBar is displayed to inform the user whether the image was saved successfully or if no image was selected.
// If no image is picked, a different SnackBar message is shown to indicate that no selection was made.
