## Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_login_yandex/flutter_login_yandex.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _userName = '';

  void _login() async {
    try {
      final result = await FlutterLoginYandex.login();
      setState(() {
        _userName = result?.name ?? 'No name';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print('Login failed: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Yandex Login Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Logged in as: $_userName'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _login,
              child: Text('Login with Yandex'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that allows users to log in using their Yandex account. The `_login` method handles the login process and updates the UI with the user's name upon successful authentication.

# Complete Example of flutter_login_yandex

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_login_yandex/flutter_login_yandex.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _userName = ''; // Variable to store the user's name

  // Method to handle Yandex login
  void _login() async {
    try {
      // Attempt to log in using Yandex
      final result = await FlutterLoginYandex.login();
      // Update the state with the user's name
      setState(() {
        _userName = result?.name ?? 'No name'; // Set user name or default
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors during login
      print('Login failed: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Yandex Login Example')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Center the column
          children: [
            Text('Logged in as: $_userName'), // Display logged-in user
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between elements
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _login, // Call _login method on button press
              child: Text('Login with Yandex'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The _RealFlutterState class manages the state of the app.
// 3. When the user presses the "Login with Yandex" button, the _login method is called.
// 4. The _login method attempts to authenticate the user using Yandex.
// 5. If successful, the user's name is retrieved and displayed on the screen.
// 6. If the login fails, an error message is printed to the console.
