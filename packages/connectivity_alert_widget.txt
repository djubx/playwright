# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Connectivity Alert Widget

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `connectivity_alert_widget`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  connectivity_alert_widget: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/connectivity_alert_widget).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet and check network state. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to implement the `ConnectivityAlertWidget` in your app:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:connectivity_alert_widget/connectivity_alert_widget.dart';
```

2. Wrap your main application widget with `ConnectivityAlertWidget`:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: ConnectivityAlertWidget(
        child: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Customize the alert widget as needed by passing parameters to `ConnectivityAlertWidget`.

Now, your application will automatically show alerts when the connectivity status changes.

# Complete Example of Using Connectivity Alert Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:connectivity_alert_widget/connectivity_alert_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Connectivity Alert Example',
      home: ConnectivityAlertWidget(
        // Customizing the alert widget
        alertText: 'You are offline!',
        alertColor: Colors.red,
        child: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen of the application
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Connectivity Alert Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Welcome to the Connectivity Alert Example!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a ConnectivityAlertWidget that wraps the HomeScreen.
// 4. The ConnectivityAlertWidget listens for connectivity changes and displays an alert when the user goes offline.
// 5. The HomeScreen displays a simple welcome message in the center of the screen.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, the application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `MyApp` widget. The `MyApp` widget sets up a `MaterialApp` and wraps the `HomeScreen` with the `ConnectivityAlertWidget`. This widget monitors the connectivity status and displays an alert if the user goes offline. The `HomeScreen` simply shows a welcome message.

This structure allows for easy integration of connectivity alerts into any Flutter application, enhancing user experience by keeping users informed about their network status.
