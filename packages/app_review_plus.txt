```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/app_review_plus).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request permission for app reviews:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>

</dict>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `app_review_plus` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:app_review_plus/app_review_plus.dart';
```

You can then call the review prompt in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to request a review:

```dart
void requestReview() async {
  try {
    await AppReviewPlus.requestReview;
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error requesting review: $e');
  }
}
```

This function can be called at appropriate times in your app, such as after a user completes a significant action or after a certain number of app launches.

# Complete Example of Using app_review_plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_review_plus/app_review_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'App Review Plus Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('App Review Plus Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Call the function to request a review
            requestReview();
          },
          child: Text('Rate Us'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void requestReview() async {
    try {
      // Requesting the app review
      await AppReviewPlus.requestReview;
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the review request
      print('Error requesting review: $e');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains a button labeled "Rate Us".
// 4. When the button is pressed, the requestReview function is called.
// 5. Inside requestReview, the AppReviewPlus.requestReview method is called to prompt the user for a review.
// 6. If an error occurs during the review request, it is caught and printed to the console.
