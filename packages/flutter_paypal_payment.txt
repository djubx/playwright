# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_paypal_payment

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_paypal_payment` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_paypal_payment` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_paypal_payment: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure for Android

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21  // Minimum SDK version
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure you have the correct deployment target set in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Minimum iOS version
```

## Step 4: Initialize PayPal

In your Flutter application, you need to initialize the PayPal payment process. Here’s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_paypal_payment/flutter_paypal_payment.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Create a Payment Screen

Create a new widget for handling payments:

```dart
class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PayPal Payment')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Call the PayPal payment method here
          },
          child: Text('Pay with PayPal'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 6: Implement Payment Logic

You can implement the payment logic using the `flutter_paypal_payment` package. Here’s an example of how to initiate a payment:

```dart
void initiatePayment() async {
  var response = await FlutterPaypalPayment.startPayment(
    clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    secret: 'YOUR_SECRET',
    amount: '10.00',
    currency: 'USD',
    description: 'Payment for services',
  );

  if (response['status'] == 'success') {
    // Handle successful payment
  } else {
    // Handle payment failure
  }
}
```

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `flutter_paypal_payment` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_paypal_payment

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `flutter_paypal_payment` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_paypal_payment/flutter_paypal_payment.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PayPal Payment Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PayPal Payment')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            initiatePayment();
          },
          child: Text('Pay with PayPal'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to initiate PayPal payment
  void initiatePayment() async {
    // Start the PayPal payment process
    var response = await FlutterPaypalPayment.startPayment(
      clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',  // Replace with your PayPal client ID
      secret: 'YOUR_SECRET',        // Replace with your PayPal secret
      amount: '10.00',              // Amount to be charged
      currency: 'USD',              // Currency type
      description: 'Payment for services', // Description of the payment
    );

    // Check the response status
    if (response['status'] == 'success') {
      // Payment was successful
      print('Payment successful: ${response['paymentId']}');
    } else {
      // Payment failed
      print('Payment failed: ${response['error'] ?? 'Unknown error'}');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp and sets the home to PaymentScreen.
// 3. The PaymentScreen widget displays a button that, when pressed, calls the initiatePayment function.
// 4. The initiatePayment function uses the FlutterPaypalPayment package to start the payment process.
// 5. It sends the client ID, secret, amount, currency, and description to PayPal.
// 6. The response is checked for success or failure, and appropriate messages are printed to the console.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we have created a simple Flutter application that integrates PayPal payment processing. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the payment process when the user clicks the "Pay with PayPal" button, and it handles the response to determine if the payment was successful or not. 

This structure provides a comprehensive guide to using the `flutter_paypal_payment` package, from setup to implementation, ensuring that developers can easily integrate PayPal payments into their Flutter applications.
