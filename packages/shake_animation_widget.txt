# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Shake Animation Widget

## Installation
To use the `shake_animation_widget` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  shake_animation_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use the `shake_animation_widget`, you can wrap any widget with the `ShakeAnimation` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shake_animation_widget/shake_animation_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Shake Animation Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ShakeAnimation(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action when button is pressed
            },
            child: Text('Shake Me!'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ShakeAnimation` widget wraps an `ElevatedButton`, which will shake when the button is pressed. You can customize the shake effect by adjusting the parameters of the `ShakeAnimation` widget.

With this setup, you are ready to start using shake animations in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Shake Animation Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shake_animation_widget/shake_animation_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Shake Animation Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // State variable to control the shake animation
  bool _isShaking = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Shake Animation Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ShakeAnimation(
          // The shake animation will trigger when _isShaking is true
          shakeAnimation: _isShaking,
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the shake animation
              setState(() {
                _isShaking = true; // Set to true to start shaking
              });

              // Reset the shake animation after a short duration
              Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () {
                setState(() {
                  _isShaking = false; // Reset to false to stop shaking
                });
              });
            },
            child: Text('Shake Me!'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The main function initializes the app and sets up the MaterialApp.
// The RealFlutter widget is the main screen of the application.
// Inside the RealFlutter widget, we have a stateful widget to manage the shake animation state.
// The _isShaking variable controls whether the button shakes or not.
// When the button is pressed, we set _isShaking to true, triggering the shake animation.
// After a delay of 1 second, we reset _isShaking to false to stop the animation.
// The ShakeAnimation widget wraps the ElevatedButton, providing the shake effect when triggered.

// This example demonstrates how to integrate the shake animation into a button press event, providing visual feedback to the user.
