- **Multiple Timer Types**: Supports countdown timers and stopwatches.
- **Event Callbacks**: Trigger events on timer completion or updates.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter widgets.

## When to Use
You might consider using the **custom_timer** package in scenarios such as:
- Building a fitness app that tracks workout durations.
- Creating a game that requires countdowns for rounds or turns.
- Developing a productivity app that manages task durations.

With its straightforward API and flexibility, the **custom_timer** package is an excellent choice for any Flutter developer looking to implement timer functionalities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Custom Timer

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the **custom_timer** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  custom_timer: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:custom_timer/custom_timer.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Custom Timer
You can now use the `CustomTimer` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
CustomTimer(
  duration: Duration(seconds: 60), // Set the timer duration
  onEnd: () {
    // Code to execute when the timer ends
    print("Timer has ended!");
  },
  builder: (CustomTimerRemainingTime remaining) {
    return Text(
      '${remaining.hours}:${remaining.minutes}:${remaining.seconds}',
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48),
    );
  },
);
```

This code snippet creates a countdown timer that lasts for 60 seconds and prints a message when the timer ends.

# Complete Example of Custom Timer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_timer/custom_timer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom Timer Example',
      home: TimerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class TimerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TimerScreenState createState() => _TimerScreenState();
}

class _TimerScreenState extends State<TimerScreen> {
  // Initialize the timer controller
  CustomTimerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Create a new CustomTimerController
    _controller = CustomTimerController();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Custom Timer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the timer
            CustomTimer(
              controller: _controller,
              duration: Duration(seconds: 60), // Set the timer duration
              onEnd: () {
                // Code to execute when the timer ends
                print("Timer has ended!");
              },
              builder: (CustomTimerRemainingTime remaining) {
                return Text(
                  '${remaining.hours}:${remaining.minutes}:${remaining.seconds}',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48),
                );
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Start button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                _controller.start(); // Start the timer
              },
              child: Text('Start Timer'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            // Pause button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                _controller.pause(); // Pause the timer
              },
              child: Text('Pause Timer'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            // Reset button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                _controller.reset(); // Reset the timer
              },
              child: Text('Reset Timer'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and sets the home screen to TimerScreen.
// 2. TimerScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the timer state.
// 3. A CustomTimerController is created to control the timer's state (start, pause, reset).
// 4. The CustomTimer widget displays the remaining time and triggers an action when the timer ends.
// 5. Three buttons allow the user to start, pause, and reset the timer, interacting with the controller.
// 6. The timer counts down from 60 seconds, updating the display every second until it reaches zero.
```
