# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Direct Select Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **direct_select** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  direct_select: ^0.6.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Direct Select Widget

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using the `DirectSelect` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:direct_select/direct_select.dart';
```

2. Create a list of items to select from:

```dart
final List<String> items = ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3', 'Option 4'];
```

3. Implement the `DirectSelect` widget in your UI:

```dart
DirectSelect(
  itemBuilder: (context, item, selected) {
    return Text(item);
  },
  items: items,
  onItemSelected: (item) {
    print('Selected: $item');
  },
)
```

This will create a simple direct selection widget that allows users to select from the provided options.

## Step 4: Customizing the Widget

You can customize the appearance of the `DirectSelect` widget by modifying its properties, such as `itemBuilder`, `selectedItemBuilder`, and more. Refer to the package documentation for more customization options.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the **direct_select** package into your Flutter application successfully.

# Complete Example of Using the Direct Select Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:direct_select/direct_select.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Direct Select Example',
      home: DirectSelectExample(),
    );
  }
}

class DirectSelectExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DirectSelectExampleState createState() => _DirectSelectExampleState();
}

class _DirectSelectExampleState extends State<DirectSelectExample> {
  // List of items to select from
  final List<String> items = ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3', 'Option 4'];
  String selectedItem = 'Option 1'; // Default selected item

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Direct Select Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the currently selected item
            Text('Selected: $selectedItem'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // DirectSelect widget for item selection
            DirectSelect<String>(
              itemBuilder: (context, item, selected) {
                return Container(
                  padding: EdgeInsets.all(10),
                  color: selected ? Colors.blue : Colors.grey[200],
                  child: Text(item),
                );
              },
              items: items,
              onItemSelected: (item) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedItem = item; // Update the selected item
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to DirectSelectExample.
// 3. DirectSelectExample is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected item.
// 4. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, the currently selected item is displayed.
// 6. The DirectSelect widget is created, allowing users to select from the list of items.
// 7. When an item is selected, the onItemSelected callback updates the selectedItem state.
// 8. The UI is rebuilt to reflect the newly selected item.
```
