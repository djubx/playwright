Here's a detailed technical blog on the "app_version" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Overview of the `app_version` Flutter Package

The `app_version` package is a Flutter plugin that allows developers to easily retrieve the version information of their applications. This package is particularly useful for displaying the app version in the UI, logging, or for analytics purposes. It provides a simple API to access the version number, build number, and other related information.

## When to Use This Package

You might want to use the `app_version` package in scenarios such as:
- Displaying the app version in the settings or about page of your application.
- Logging the version information for analytics or debugging purposes.
- Ensuring that users are aware of the version they are using, especially when reporting issues.

## Features

- **Easy Access**: Retrieve the app version and build number with minimal setup.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Lightweight**: The package is lightweight and does not add significant overhead to your application.

## Example Usage

To use the `app_version` package, you would typically call it in your Flutter application as follows:

```dart
import 'package:app_version/app_version.dart';

void main() async {
  // Fetch the app version
  String version = await AppVersion.getVersion();
  print('App Version: $version');
}
```

This simple example demonstrates how to fetch and print the app version when the application starts.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `app_version` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `app_version` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  app_version: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Typically, no additional permissions are required for this package, but make sure your app's `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your `Info.plist` file contains the correct versioning information. This is usually set up by default, but you can verify it as follows:

```xml
<key>CFBundleShortVersionString</key>
<string>1.0</string>
<key>CFBundleVersion</key>
<string>1</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to retrieve and display the app version:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_version/app_version.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('App Version Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<String>(
            future: AppVersion.getVersion(),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                return Text('App Version: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we use a `FutureBuilder` to asynchronously fetch the app version and display it in the UI.

# Complete Example of Using the `app_version` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_version/app_version.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('App Version Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<String>(
            future: AppVersion.getVersion(), // Fetching the app version
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              // Checking the connection state
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'); // Display error if any
              } else {
                return Text('App Version: ${snapshot.data}'); // Display the app version
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, a FutureBuilder is used to asynchronously fetch the app version using AppVersion.getVersion().
4. While the version is being fetched, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed to indicate loading.
5. Once the version is retrieved, it is displayed in the center of the screen. If there is an error during fetching, the error message is shown instead.
