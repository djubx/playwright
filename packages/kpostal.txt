# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using kpostal

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the kpostal package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the kpostal package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  kpostal: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using kpostal in Your Application

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in a Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the kpostal package in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:kpostal/kpostal.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Kpostal Example',
      home: PostalCodeInputScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PostalCodeInputScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PostalCodeInputScreenState createState() => _PostalCodeInputScreenState();
}

class _PostalCodeInputScreenState extends State<PostalCodeInputScreen> {
  String _postalCode = ''; // Variable to hold the postal code

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Kpostal Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // TextField for postal code input
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter Postal Code',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
              onChanged: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  _postalCode = value; // Update postal code on change
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to trigger postal code validation
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Validate postal code
                if (_postalCode.isNotEmpty) {
                  // Show success message
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Postal Code: $_postalCode')),
                  );
                } else {
                  // Show error message
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Please enter a postal code')),
                  );
                }
              },
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The PostalCodeInputScreen is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the postal code input.
// 4. The build method of PostalCodeInputScreen creates a UI with a TextField for postal code input and a button to submit the code.
// 5. When the user types in the TextField, the _postalCode variable is updated.
// 6. Upon pressing the submit button, the app checks if the postal code is not empty and displays it in a SnackBar.
// 7. If the postal code is empty, an error message is shown.
```
