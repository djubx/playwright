# Change Case Flutter Package

The **change_case** Flutter package is a versatile utility designed to simplify the process of converting strings between various case formats. This package is particularly useful for developers who need to manipulate text in their applications, such as converting user input, formatting data for APIs, or displaying text in a user-friendly manner.

## Features
- **Multiple Case Conversions**: Supports various case formats including camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case, kebab-case, and more.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to add to any Flutter project with minimal setup.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance, ensuring that string manipulations are handled efficiently.

## When to Use
- When you need to format strings for display purposes, such as converting user input to a specific case.
- When working with APIs that require specific case formats for keys or values.
- For data processing tasks where consistent string formatting is necessary.

## Example Use Cases
- Converting a user’s input from a text field into a specific case before sending it to a server.
- Formatting database field names to match a specific case style.
- Displaying text in a user-friendly format in your Flutter app.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Change Case Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the **change_case** package, you first need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  change_case: ^4.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:change_case/change_case.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
You can now use the various case conversion methods provided by the package. Here’s a brief overview of how to use some of the key features:

### Example Usage
```dart
void main() {
  String text = "hello world";

  // Convert to camelCase
  String camelCase = text.toCamelCase();
  print(camelCase); // Output: helloWorld

  // Convert to PascalCase
  String pascalCase = text.toPascalCase();
  print(pascalCase); // Output: HelloWorld

  // Convert to snake_case
  String snakeCase = text.toSnakeCase();
  print(snakeCase); // Output: hello_world

  // Convert to kebab-case
  String kebabCase = text.toKebabCase();
  print(kebabCase); // Output: hello-world
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly.

### iOS
Similarly, for iOS, no special configurations are needed. Just make sure to run `flutter pub get` after adding the dependency.

## Optimizations
While the package is optimized for performance, always ensure that you are using the latest version to benefit from any improvements or bug fixes.

# Complete Example of Using Change Case Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:change_case/change_case.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Change Case Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Change Case Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ChangeCaseDemo(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ChangeCaseDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample text to demonstrate case conversion
    String sampleText = "hello world";

    // Converting the sample text to different cases
    String camelCase = sampleText.toCamelCase(); // helloWorld
    String pascalCase = sampleText.toPascalCase(); // HelloWorld
    String snakeCase = sampleText.toSnakeCase(); // hello_world
    String kebabCase = sampleText.toKebabCase(); // hello-world

    // Displaying the converted cases in a column
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Original: $sampleText'),
        Text('Camel Case: $camelCase'),
        Text('Pascal Case: $pascalCase'),
        Text('Snake Case: $snakeCase'),
        Text('Kebab Case: $kebabCase'),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the ChangeCaseDemo widget.
// 4. The ChangeCaseDemo widget converts a sample string "hello world" into various case formats.
// 5. The converted strings are displayed in a Column widget, showing the original and converted cases.
