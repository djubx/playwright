## Setup Process

To use the `material_segmented_control` package in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     material_segmented_control: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0.

4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:material_segmented_control/material_segmented_control.dart';
   ```

## Using the Package

To use the `material_segmented_control`, you can create a simple segmented control widget as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:material_segmented_control/material_segmented_control.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _selectedSegment = 0; // Track the selected segment

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Segmented Control Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: <Widget>[
          MaterialSegmentedControl(
            children: {
              0: Text('Option 1'),
              1: Text('Option 2'),
              2: Text('Option 3'),
            },
            selectionIndex: _selectedSegment,
            onSegmentChosen: (index) {
              setState(() {
                _selectedSegment = index; // Update the selected segment
              });
            },
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          Text('Selected Option: ${_selectedSegment + 1}'), // Display selected option
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple segmented control with three options. When a user selects an option, the selected index is updated, and the corresponding option is displayed below the control.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:material_segmented_control/material_segmented_control.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// The main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Segmented Control Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home to our RealFlutter widget
    );
  }
}

// The RealFlutter widget that contains the segmented control
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

// State class for RealFlutter
class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _selectedSegment = 0; // Variable to track the selected segment

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Segmented Control Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: <Widget>[
          // MaterialSegmentedControl widget
          MaterialSegmentedControl(
            children: {
              0: Text('Option 1'), // First option
              1: Text('Option 2'), // Second option
              2: Text('Option 3'), // Third option
            },
            selectionIndex: _selectedSegment, // Current selected index
            onSegmentChosen: (index) {
              setState(() {
                _selectedSegment = index; // Update the selected segment
              });
            },
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between widgets
          // Display the currently selected option
          Text('Selected Option: ${_selectedSegment + 1}'),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected segment.
// 4. The MaterialSegmentedControl widget displays three options.
// 5. When a user selects an option, the onSegmentChosen callback updates the _selectedSegment variable.
// 6. The UI rebuilds to reflect the selected option, which is displayed below the segmented control.
```
