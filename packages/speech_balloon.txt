# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Speech Balloon Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **speech_balloon** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  speech_balloon: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/speech_balloon).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:speech_balloon/speech_balloon.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Speech Balloon Widget

You can now use the `SpeechBalloon` widget in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
SpeechBalloon(
  child: Text("Hello, this is a speech balloon!"),
  balloonColor: Colors.blue,
  textColor: Colors.white,
  tail: true,
)
```

This code creates a speech balloon with a blue background and white text. The `tail` property adds a tail to the balloon, making it look like it’s pointing to the associated widget.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the **speech_balloon** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the Speech Balloon Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:speech_balloon/speech_balloon.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Speech Balloon Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Speech Balloon Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: GestureDetector(
            // Detects taps on the text
            onTap: () {
              // Show a speech balloon when the text is tapped
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) {
                  return AlertDialog(
                    content: SpeechBalloon(
                      child: Text("This is a speech balloon!"),
                      balloonColor: Colors.blue,
                      textColor: Colors.white,
                      tail: true,
                    ),
                  );
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text(
              'Tap me!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. The child is a GestureDetector that listens for tap events.
// 5. When the text "Tap me!" is tapped, an AlertDialog is shown.
// 6. The AlertDialog contains a SpeechBalloon widget that displays a message.
// 7. The SpeechBalloon is styled with a blue background and white text, and it has a tail pointing to the text.
```

// Final Summary:
// The application starts with the main function, which initializes the Flutter app. The RealFlutter widget sets up the UI with an AppBar and a centered text. When the user taps the text, an AlertDialog appears, showcasing the SpeechBalloon widget. This demonstrates how to integrate the speech balloon into a Flutter application, providing a clear and interactive user experience.
