Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

2. Add the following permissions and metadata:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
    
    <application>
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.airship.appKey"
            android:value="YOUR_AIRSHIP_APP_KEY"/>
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.airship.secret"
            android:value="YOUR_AIRSHIP_APP_SECRET"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration

2. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
<key>AirshipAppKey</key>
<string>YOUR_AIRSHIP_APP_KEY</string>
<key>AirshipAppSecret</key>
<string>YOUR_AIRSHIP_APP_SECRET</string>
```

## Step 3: Initializing the Package

In your main Dart file, initialize the **airship_flutter** package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:airship_flutter/airship_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  AirshipFlutter().init();
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to send and receive notifications. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to handle incoming notifications:

```dart
AirshipFlutter().onNotificationReceived.listen((notification) {
  // Handle the notification
  print('Notification received: ${notification.title}');
});
```

This setup allows you to receive notifications and handle them accordingly.

# Complete Example of Airship Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:airship_flutter/airship_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp()); // Start the Flutter application
  AirshipFlutter().init(); // Initialize the Airship package
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Airship Flutter Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(), // Set the home screen of the app
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _notificationMessage = 'No notifications yet'; // Default message

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Listen for incoming notifications
    AirshipFlutter().onNotificationReceived.listen((notification) {
      setState(() {
        _notificationMessage = notification.title; // Update message on notification
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Airship Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _notificationMessage, // Display the notification message
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Simulate sending a notification
          AirshipFlutter().sendNotification('Hello from Airship!'); // Send a test notification
        },
        tooltip: 'Send Notification',
        child: Icon(Icons.notifications),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing the Airship package.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, setting up the MaterialApp with a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget listens for incoming notifications in its initState method.
// 4. When a notification is received, the state is updated to display the notification title.
// 5. The floating action button simulates sending a notification when pressed.
```
