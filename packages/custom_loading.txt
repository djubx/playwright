# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Custom Loading

## Installation
To add the `custom_loading` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  custom_loading: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage
### Basic Setup
To use the `custom_loading` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:custom_loading/custom_loading.dart';
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
- **iOS**: No additional configuration is required for iOS, but ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a custom loading indicator in your Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_loading/custom_loading.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom Loading Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomLoading(
            loadingText: 'Loading...',
            // Customize the loading style here
            loadingStyle: LoadingStyle.circle,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates a basic implementation of a circular loading indicator with a text label. You can customize the `loadingStyle` and other properties to fit your design needs.

# Complete Example of Custom Loading in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_loading/custom_loading.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: LoadingScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class LoadingScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LoadingScreenState createState() => _LoadingScreenState();
}

class _LoadingScreenState extends State<LoadingScreen> {
  bool _isLoading = true; // State variable to control loading

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Simulate a network request or long-running task
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3), () {
      setState(() {
        _isLoading = false; // Update state to stop loading
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom Loading Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: _isLoading
            ? CustomLoading(
                loadingText: 'Loading...',
                loadingStyle: LoadingStyle.circle, // Custom loading style
              )
            : Text('Data Loaded!'), // Display content after loading
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The main function initializes the app and runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp and directs to the LoadingScreen.
// The LoadingScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the loading state.
// In the initState method, we simulate a network request with a delay of 3 seconds.
// During this delay, the loading indicator is displayed using CustomLoading.
// Once the delay is over, we update the state to stop loading and display 'Data Loaded!'.

// This flow allows for a smooth transition from a loading state to displaying the loaded content.
