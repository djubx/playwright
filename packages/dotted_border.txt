# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Dotted Border Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **dotted_border** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dotted_border: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:dotted_border/dotted_border.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Dotted Border

You can use the `DottedBorder` widget to wrap around any widget you want to have a dotted border. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
DottedBorder(
  color: Colors.blue, // Border color
  strokeWidth: 2, // Width of the dots
  dashPattern: [6, 3], // Length of the dash and gap
  child: Container(
    height: 100,
    width: 100,
    child: Center(child: Text('Dotted Border')),
  ),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customization Options

The `DottedBorder` widget provides several customization options:
- **color**: Sets the color of the dots.
- **strokeWidth**: Adjusts the thickness of the dots.
- **dashPattern**: Defines the pattern of the dashes and gaps.

You can combine these options to create a unique dotted border that fits your app's design.

# Complete Example of Using Dotted Border

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dotted_border/dotted_border.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dotted Border Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dotted Border Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DottedBorder(
            color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the dotted border
            strokeWidth: 2, // Set the width of the dots
            dashPattern: [6, 3], // Define the dash pattern
            child: Container(
              height: 200, // Set the height of the container
              width: 200, // Set the width of the container
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Hello, Dotted Border!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16), // Text style
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Dotted Border Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a DottedBorder widget.
// 5. The DottedBorder widget wraps a Container, which has a specified height and width.
// 6. Inside the Container, there is a Center widget that contains a Text widget displaying 'Hello, Dotted Border!'.
// 7. The DottedBorder widget applies a blue dotted border around the Container, enhancing the visual appeal of the text inside.
