# Coordinator Layout Flutter Package

The `coordinator_layout` package is a powerful Flutter library designed to simplify the creation of complex layouts that require coordinated scrolling and animations. It allows developers to create responsive and dynamic user interfaces that can adapt to various screen sizes and orientations. This package is particularly useful for applications that require a seamless user experience, such as social media apps, news apps, or any app that features a combination of scrolling content and fixed headers.

## Key Features
- **Coordinated Scrolling**: Synchronizes the scrolling of multiple widgets, allowing for a more fluid user experience.
- **Flexible Layouts**: Supports various layout configurations, making it easy to create complex designs.
- **Animation Support**: Integrates with Flutter's animation framework to provide smooth transitions and animations.
- **Customizable**: Offers a range of customization options to tailor the layout to specific needs.

## When to Use
- When building applications that require a combination of scrolling and fixed elements.
- For creating complex layouts that need to respond to user interactions.
- In scenarios where smooth animations and transitions are essential for user engagement.

Overall, the `coordinator_layout` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with sophisticated layout capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Coordinator Layout

## Installation
To get started with the `coordinator_layout` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  coordinator_layout: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/coordinator_layout).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a coordinated layout.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:coordinator_layout/coordinator_layout.dart';
```

2. Create a basic layout using `CoordinatorLayout`:

```dart
CoordinatorLayout(
  children: [
    // Add your widgets here
  ],
);
```

This will set up the basic structure for your coordinated layout. You can add various widgets as children to create the desired effect.

# Complete Example of Coordinator Layout

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:coordinator_layout/coordinator_layout.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Coordinator Layout Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        body: CoordinatorLayout(
          // The CoordinatorLayout widget allows for coordinated scrolling
          children: [
            // A header that will scroll with the content
            Container(
              height: 200,
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Header',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            // A scrollable list of items
            Expanded(
              child: ListView.builder(
                itemCount: 50,
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text('Item $index'),
                  );
                },
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, a CoordinatorLayout is created, which allows for coordinated scrolling.
// 4. The first child of the CoordinatorLayout is a Container that serves as a header.
// 5. The header has a fixed height and a blue background, displaying the text "Header".
// 6. The second child is an Expanded widget containing a ListView.builder.
// 7. The ListView.builder generates a list of 50 items, each represented by a ListTile.
// 8. As the user scrolls, the header and the list items scroll together, creating a smooth user experience.
