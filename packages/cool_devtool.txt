# Tutorial: Setting Up Cool DevTool

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the **cool_devtool** package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter project.

## Installation

To add the **cool_devtool** package to your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file.
2. Add the following dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     cool_devtool: ^1.0.0
   ```

3. Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on the features you plan to use. For example, if you are monitoring network requests, you might need to add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Usage

Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Import the package at the top of your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:cool_devtool/cool_devtool.dart';
```

You can then initialize the tool in your `main` function:

```dart
void main() {
  CoolDevTool.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This will set up the debugging tools and allow you to access the dashboard during development.

# Complete Example of Cool DevTool

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cool_devtool/cool_devtool.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the CoolDevTool package
  CoolDevTool.initialize();
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cool DevTool Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    // Increment the counter and update the UI
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
    // Log the state change to CoolDevTool
    CoolDevTool.log('Counter incremented to $_counter');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Cool DevTool Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            Text(
              '$_counter',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the CoolDevTool and runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds the MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget maintains a counter state.
// 4. When the floating action button is pressed, the _incrementCounter method is called.
// 5. This method increments the counter and calls setState to update the UI.
// 6. It also logs the new counter value to the CoolDevTool for monitoring.
// 7. The updated counter value is displayed in the center of the screen.
```
