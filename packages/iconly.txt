# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Iconly

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Iconly package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding Iconly to Your Project

To get started, you need to add the Iconly package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  iconly: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing Iconly

In your Dart file, import the Iconly package:

```dart
import 'package:iconly/iconly.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Iconly Icons

You can now use Iconly icons in your Flutter widgets. Here’s how to use them:

```dart
Icon(
  IconlyBold.home, // Use the bold version of the home icon
  size: 30.0,      // Set the size of the icon
  color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the icon
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific features that involve icons.

## Step 4: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons further by changing their size, color, and weight. Here’s an example:

```dart
Icon(
  IconlyLight.star, // Use the light version of the star icon
  size: 40.0,       // Set a larger size
  color: Colors.red, // Change the color to red
)
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate and customize the Iconly package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using Iconly in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iconly/iconly.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Iconly Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Iconly Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a bold home icon
            Icon(
              IconlyBold.home,
              size: 50.0,
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between icons
            // Displaying a light star icon
            Icon(
              IconlyLight.star,
              size: 50.0,
              color: Colors.red,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between icons
            // Displaying a broken heart icon
            Icon(
              IconlyBroken.heart,
              size: 50.0,
              color: Colors.pink,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of the MaterialApp is set to HomeScreen, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. The HomeScreen widget builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 6. Three Icon widgets are displayed: a bold home icon, a light star icon, and a broken heart icon, each with specified sizes and colors.
// 7. The SizedBox widget is used to add space between the icons for better visual separation.
