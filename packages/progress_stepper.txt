# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Progress Stepper Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `progress_stepper` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  progress_stepper: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:progress_stepper/progress_stepper.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Setup

You can now use the `ProgressStepper` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to set it up:

### Android and iOS Configuration

For both Android and iOS, no additional configuration is required for the `progress_stepper` package. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms. 

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement the `ProgressStepper` in your Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:progress_stepper/progress_stepper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: StepperExample(),
    );
  }
}

class StepperExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StepperExampleState createState() => _StepperExampleState();
}

class _StepperExampleState extends State<StepperExample> {
  int currentStep = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Progress Stepper Example')),
      body: ProgressStepper(
        steps: [
          Step(title: Text('Step 1'), content: Text('Content for Step 1')),
          Step(title: Text('Step 2'), content: Text('Content for Step 2')),
          Step(title: Text('Step 3'), content: Text('Content for Step 3')),
        ],
        currentStep: currentStep,
        onStepTapped: (step) {
          setState(() {
            currentStep = step;
          });
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic progress stepper with three steps. Users can tap on each step to navigate through the content.

# Complete Example of Progress Stepper

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:progress_stepper/progress_stepper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: StepperExample(),
    );
  }
}

class StepperExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StepperExampleState createState() => _StepperExampleState();
}

class _StepperExampleState extends State<StepperExample> {
  // Variable to keep track of the current step
  int currentStep = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Progress Stepper Example')),
      body: ProgressStepper(
        // Define the steps of the stepper
        steps: [
          Step(
            title: Text('Step 1'), // Title of the first step
            content: Column(
              children: [
                Text('Content for Step 1'), // Content for the first step
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Move to the next step when button is pressed
                    setState(() {
                      currentStep++;
                    });
                  },
                  child: Text('Next'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
          Step(
            title: Text('Step 2'), // Title of the second step
            content: Column(
              children: [
                Text('Content for Step 2'), // Content for the second step
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Move to the next step when button is pressed
                    setState(() {
                      currentStep++;
                    });
                  },
                  child: Text('Next'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
          Step(
            title: Text('Step 3'), // Title of the third step
            content: Column(
              children: [
                Text('Content for Step 3'), // Content for the third step
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Reset to the first step when button is pressed
                    setState(() {
                      currentStep = 0;
                    });
                  },
                  child: Text('Restart'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ],
        currentStep: currentStep, // Current step index
        onStepTapped: (step) {
          // Update the current step when a step is tapped
          setState(() {
            currentStep = step;
          });
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The StepperExample widget is created, which maintains the current step state.
// 3. The ProgressStepper widget is used to display the steps.
// 4. Each step has a title and content, with a button to navigate to the next step.
// 5. When the "Next" button is pressed, the current step index is incremented.
// 6. The last step has a "Restart" button that resets the current step to 0.
// 7. Users can also tap on the step titles to navigate directly to that step.
