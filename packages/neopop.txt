# Neopop Flutter Package

The **neopop** package is a Flutter library that provides a set of customizable and animated buttons, inspired by the popular Neumorphism design trend. This package allows developers to create visually appealing user interfaces with soft, inset shadows and a modern aesthetic. 

## When to Use Neopop

You might consider using the neopop package in scenarios such as:
- When designing applications that require a modern and sleek UI.
- For creating interactive buttons that enhance user engagement.
- In projects where you want to implement neumorphic design principles.

## Features

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Neopop

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the neopop package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  neopop: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that the project settings are configured to support Swift.

## Step 3: Using Neopop in Your Flutter App

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a Neopop button:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:neopop/neopop.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Neopop Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: NeopopButton(
          onTap: () {
            // Action on button press
            print('Neopop Button Pressed!');
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Neopop button that prints a message to the console when pressed.

## Step 4: Customizing the Button

You can customize the button's appearance by modifying its properties. For example:

```dart
NeopopButton(
  onTap: () {
    print('Customized Neopop Button Pressed!');
  },
  child: Text('Custom Button'),
  style: NeopopStyle(
    color: Colors.blue,
    shadowColor: Colors.black,
    borderRadius: 12.0,
  ),
)
```

This customization allows you to change the button's color, shadow, and border radius, making it fit your app's design.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate and use the neopop package in your Flutter applications effectively.

# Complete Example of Neopop in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:neopop/neopop.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Neopop Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Neopop Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Neopop button with default style
            NeopopButton(
              onTap: () {
                // Action on button press
                print('Default Neopop Button Pressed!');
              },
              child: Text('Default Button'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between buttons
            // Customized Neopop button
            NeopopButton(
              onTap: () {
                // Action on button press
                print('Customized Neopop Button Pressed!');
              },
              child: Text('Custom Button'),
              style: NeopopStyle(
                color: Colors.green,
                shadowColor: Colors.black,
                borderRadius: 12.0,
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 4. In RealFlutter, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange two Neopop buttons vertically.
// 6. The first button is a default Neopop button that prints a message when pressed.
// 7. The second button is a customized Neopop button with a green color and rounded corners.
// 8. Each button has an onTap callback that triggers a print statement when pressed.
