# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Media Picker Widget

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `media_picker_widget` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `media_picker_widget` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  media_picker_widget: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/media_picker_widget).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission for accessing the camera and photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select images and videos.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos and videos.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Media Picker Widget

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the media picker in your app.

# Complete Example: Media Picker Widget in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:media_picker_widget/media_picker_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Media Picker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MediaPickerHome(),
    );
  }
}

class MediaPickerHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MediaPickerHomeState createState() => _MediaPickerHomeState();
}

class _MediaPickerHomeState extends State<MediaPickerHome> {
  List<Media> _selectedMedia = []; // List to hold selected media files

  // Function to open the media picker
  void _pickMedia() async {
    final List<Media>? pickedMedia = await showMediaPicker(
      context: context,
      allowMultiple: true, // Allow multiple selections
      mediaType: MediaType.all, // Allow both images and videos
    );

    if (pickedMedia != null) {
      setState(() {
        _selectedMedia = pickedMedia; // Update the state with selected media
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Media Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _pickMedia, // Trigger media picker on button press
            child: Text('Pick Media'),
          ),
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: _selectedMedia.length, // Count of selected media
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(_selectedMedia[index].name), // Display media name
                  leading: _selectedMedia[index].type == MediaType.image
                      ? Image.file(_selectedMedia[index].file) // Show image thumbnail
                      : Icon(Icons.videocam), // Show video icon
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is MediaPickerHome, which contains a button to pick media.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _pickMedia function is called.
// 5. The media picker is displayed, allowing the user to select multiple media files.
// 6. Once the user selects media, the state is updated, and the selected media is displayed in a list.
// 7. Each media item shows its name and a thumbnail for images or an icon for videos.
```
