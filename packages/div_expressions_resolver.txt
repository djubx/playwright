# Overview of the `div_expressions_resolver` Flutter Package

The `div_expressions_resolver` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to evaluate mathematical expressions dynamically. This package allows you to parse and compute expressions at runtime, making it ideal for applications that require real-time calculations, such as calculators, financial apps, or any app that needs to evaluate user-defined formulas.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Expression Evaluation**: Evaluate mathematical expressions provided as strings.
- **Support for Variables**: Use variables within expressions, allowing for flexible calculations.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to handle syntax errors and invalid expressions gracefully.
- **Custom Functions**: Extend the functionality by adding custom functions to the expression evaluator.

## When to Use
You should consider using `div_expressions_resolver` when:
- You need to implement a feature that requires evaluating user-defined mathematical expressions.
- Your application involves complex calculations that cannot be hardcoded.
- You want to provide users with the ability to input formulas dynamically.

# Setting Up and Using the `div_expressions_resolver` Package

## Installation
To get started with the `div_expressions_resolver` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  div_expressions_resolver: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities related to user input.

## Basic Usage
To use the `div_expressions_resolver` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:div_expressions_resolver/div_expressions_resolver.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class (which we will define in the complete example) to evaluate expressions.

# Complete Example of Using `div_expressions_resolver`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:div_expressions_resolver/div_expressions_resolver.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Expression Evaluator',
      home: ExpressionEvaluatorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ExpressionEvaluatorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ExpressionEvaluatorScreenState createState() => _ExpressionEvaluatorScreenState();
}

class _ExpressionEvaluatorScreenState extends State<ExpressionEvaluatorScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  String _result = '';

  void _evaluateExpression() {
    // Create an instance of the ExpressionResolver
    final resolver = ExpressionResolver();

    try {
      // Evaluate the expression from the input field
      final expression = _controller.text;
      final result = resolver.evaluate(expression);
      
      // Update the result state
      setState(() {
        _result = 'Result: $result';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors during evaluation
      setState(() {
        _result = 'Error: ${e.toString()}';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Expression Evaluator'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _controller,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter Expression',
                hintText: 'e.g. 3 + 5 * (2 - 1)',
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _evaluateExpression,
              child: Text('Evaluate'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_result, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The ExpressionEvaluatorScreen is a stateful widget that manages user input and evaluation.
// 4. A TextEditingController is used to capture the user's expression input.
// 5. When the user presses the 'Evaluate' button, the _evaluateExpression method is called.
// 6. This method creates an instance of ExpressionResolver and attempts to evaluate the expression.
// 7. If successful, the result is displayed; if there's an error, it shows an error message.
