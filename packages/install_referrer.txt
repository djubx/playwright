# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `install_referrer` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `install_referrer` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  install_referrer: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Add the Install Referrer Library**: Ensure that your app's build.gradle file includes the necessary dependencies. In `android/app/build.gradle`, add:

   ```groovy
   dependencies {
       implementation 'com.android.installreferrer:installreferrer:2.2'
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, no additional configuration is required for the `install_referrer` package. However, ensure that your app is set up correctly to handle any necessary permissions.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to retrieve the install referrer information:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:install_referrer/install_referrer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _referrer = 'Unknown';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getInstallReferrer();
  }

  Future<void> _getInstallReferrer() async {
    try {
      final referrer = await InstallReferrer.getReferrer();
      setState(() {
        _referrer = referrer ?? 'No referrer found';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _referrer = 'Error retrieving referrer: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Install Referrer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Install Referrer: $_referrer'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, we initialize the `InstallReferrer` package, retrieve the referrer information, and display it on the screen. The `_getInstallReferrer` method handles the asynchronous call to fetch the referrer data.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate and use the `install_referrer` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the `install_referrer` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:install_referrer/install_referrer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the referrer information
  String _referrer = 'Unknown';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Call the method to get the install referrer when the app starts
    _getInstallReferrer();
  }

  // Method to fetch the install referrer
  Future<void> _getInstallReferrer() async {
    try {
      // Attempt to get the referrer information
      final referrer = await InstallReferrer.getReferrer();
      // Update the state with the retrieved referrer
      setState(() {
        _referrer = referrer ?? 'No referrer found';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the fetch
      setState(() {
        _referrer = 'Error retrieving referrer: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Install Referrer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Display the referrer information on the screen
        child: Text('Install Referrer: $_referrer'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. In the initState method, _getInstallReferrer is called to fetch the referrer data.
// 3. The _getInstallReferrer method attempts to retrieve the referrer using the InstallReferrer package.
// 4. If successful, the referrer is stored in the _referrer variable and the UI is updated.
// 5. If an error occurs, the error message is stored in _referrer and the UI is updated accordingly.
// 6. The referrer information is displayed in the center of the screen.
