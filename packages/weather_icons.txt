# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Weather Icons Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the **weather_icons** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  weather_icons: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file where you want to use the weather icons, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:weather_icons/weather_icons.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Weather Icons
You can now use the weather icons in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s how to display a sunny icon:

```dart
Icon(
  WeatherIcons.day_sunny,
  size: 50.0, // Set the size of the icon
  color: Colors.yellow, // Set the color of the icon
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations
- **Icon Size**: Adjust the icon size based on the device screen size to ensure a responsive design.
- **Caching**: If you are using multiple icons, consider caching them to improve performance.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate and use the **weather_icons** package in your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Using Weather Icons in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:weather_icons/weather_icons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Weather Icons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Weather Icons Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a sunny icon
              Icon(
                WeatherIcons.day_sunny,
                size: 100.0, // Set the size of the icon
                color: Colors.yellow, // Set the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between icons
              // Displaying a rainy icon
              Icon(
                WeatherIcons.rain,
                size: 100.0, // Set the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between icons
              // Displaying a snowy icon
              Icon(
                WeatherIcons.snow,
                size: 100.0, // Set the size of the icon
                color: Colors.white, // Set the color of the icon
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Weather Icons Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, three Icon widgets are displayed: a sunny icon, a rainy icon, and a snowy icon.
// 6. Each icon is customized with size and color, and SizedBox widgets are used to add space between them.
// 7. The app demonstrates how to use different weather icons from the weather_icons package effectively.
