# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Adaptive Chameleon Theme Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `adaptive_chameleon_theme` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  adaptive_chameleon_theme: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:adaptive_chameleon_theme/adaptive_chameleon_theme.dart';
```

## Step 3: Setting Up the Theme

You need to wrap your application with the `AdaptiveChameleonTheme` widget. This widget will manage the theme for your entire app.

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the following settings to support dark mode:

```xml
<application
    android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.DayNight">
</application>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your `Info.plist` file includes the following to support dark mode:

```xml
<key>UIUserInterfaceStyle</key>
<string>Automatic</string>
```

## Step 4: Using the Theme in Your App

You can now use the `AdaptiveChameleonTheme` in your `main.dart` file. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adaptive_chameleon_theme/adaptive_chameleon_theme.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AdaptiveChameleonTheme(
      lightTheme: ThemeData.light(),
      darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(),
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Adaptive Chameleon Theme Demo',
        theme: ThemeData.light(),
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Adaptive Chameleon Theme'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Hello, World!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This setup will allow your app to adapt its theme based on the user's system preferences.

# Complete Example of Adaptive Chameleon Theme

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adaptive_chameleon_theme/adaptive_chameleon_theme.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AdaptiveChameleonTheme(
      // Define light and dark themes
      lightTheme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        brightness: Brightness.light,
      ),
      darkTheme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.red,
        brightness: Brightness.dark,
      ),
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Adaptive Chameleon Theme Demo',
        theme: ThemeData.light(), // Default theme
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Adaptive Chameleon Theme'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Hello, World!'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Toggle theme manually
                AdaptiveChameleonTheme.of(context).toggleTheme();
              },
              child: Text('Toggle Theme'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the AdaptiveChameleonTheme with light and dark themes.
// 3. The MaterialApp is created with a title and a default light theme.
// 4. HomeScreen is set as the home widget, which contains a simple UI with a greeting and a button.
// 5. The button toggles the theme between light and dark when pressed, demonstrating the adaptive capabilities of the package.
