This package is useful when you need to:

* Customize the keyboard type (e.g., numeric, email, phone)
* Change the keyboard appearance (e.g., dark, light)
* Handle keyboard events (e.g., key press, key release)
* Manage keyboard visibility and focus

### Features

* Support for various keyboard types (e.g., `TextInputType.number`, `TextInputType.emailAddress`)
* Customizable keyboard appearance (e.g., `KeyboardAppearance.dark`, `KeyboardAppearance.light`)
* Keyboard event handling (e.g., `onKeyPressed`, `onKeyReleased`)
* Keyboard visibility and focus management (e.g., `showKeyboard`, `hideKeyboard`)

```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_keyboard/flutter_keyboard.dart';

### Step 3: Create a Keyboard Controller

Create a `KeyboardController` instance to manage keyboard behavior:
```dart
final keyboardController = KeyboardController();
```
### Step 4: Customize Keyboard Appearance and Behavior

Customize keyboard appearance and behavior using the `keyboardController` instance:
```dart
keyboardController.keyboardAppearance = KeyboardAppearance.dark;
keyboardController.keyboardType = TextInputType.number;
```
### Step 5: Handle Keyboard Events

Handle keyboard events using the `keyboardController` instance:
```dart
keyboardController.onKeyPressed.listen((key) {
  print('Key pressed: $key');
});
```
### Platform-Specific Details

            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                keyboardController.showKeyboard();
              },
              child: Text('Show Keyboard'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                keyboardController.hideKeyboard();
              },

            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a text field and two buttons.
// 2. The user clicks the "Show Keyboard" button, which calls the `showKeyboard` method on the `keyboardController` instance.
// 3. The keyboard appears, and the user can enter a number.
// 4. The user clicks the "Hide Keyboard" button, which calls the `hideKeyboard` method on the `keyboardController` instance.
// 5. The keyboard disappears, and the user can no longer enter a number.
```

// Summary:
// The code creates a Flutter app with a text field and two buttons.
// The `keyboardController` instance is used to customize keyboard appearance and behavior.
// The `showKeyboard` and `hideKeyboard` methods are used to control keyboard visibility.
// The app demonstrates how to use the `flutter_keyboard` package to manage keyboard behavior in a Flutter app.
