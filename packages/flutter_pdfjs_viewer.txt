# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_pdfjs_viewer

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_pdfjs_viewer` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_pdfjs_viewer` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_pdfjs_viewer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_pdfjs_viewer).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.3' // Add this line
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple Flutter application to display a PDF.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pdfjs_viewer/flutter_pdfjs_viewer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PDF Viewer Example',
      home: PDFViewerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PDFViewerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Viewer'),
      ),
      body: PDFViewer(
        filePath: 'assets/sample.pdf', // Path to your PDF file
        // You can also use a URL to load a PDF from the web
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Main Function**: The entry point of the application, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
- **RealFlutter Class**: A stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home screen.
- **PDFViewerScreen Class**: This widget contains the PDF viewer, which loads a PDF file from the assets.

Now you can run your application, and it should display the PDF file specified in the `filePath`.

# Complete Example of flutter_pdfjs_viewer

Hereâ€™s a complete example of a Flutter application using the `flutter_pdfjs_viewer` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pdfjs_viewer/flutter_pdfjs_viewer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The main widget of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PDF Viewer Example',
      home: PDFViewerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// A stateless widget that represents the PDF viewer screen
class PDFViewerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Viewer'), // Title of the app bar
      ),
      body: PDFViewer(
        filePath: 'assets/sample.pdf', // Path to your PDF file
        // You can also use a URL to load a PDF from the web
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The home screen is PDFViewerScreen, which contains a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold has an AppBar with a title and a body that displays the PDFViewer.
// 5. The PDFViewer loads a PDF file from the specified path in the assets folder.
```

### Application Flow Explanation

- **Main Function**: This is the entry point of the application. It calls `runApp()` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
- **RealFlutter Widget**: This widget creates a `MaterialApp` with a title and sets the home screen to `PDFViewerScreen`.
- **PDFViewerScreen Widget**: This widget builds a `Scaffold` that contains an `AppBar` and a `PDFViewer`.
- **PDFViewer**: This widget is responsible for rendering the PDF file specified in the `filePath`. You can load PDFs from local assets or URLs.

In summary, this application demonstrates how to set up and use the `flutter_pdfjs_viewer` package to display PDF documents in a Flutter app. The code is structured to provide a clear flow from the main entry point to the PDF viewing functionality, making it easy to understand and extend for additional features.
