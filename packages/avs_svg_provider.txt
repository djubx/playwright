# avs_svg_provider Flutter Package

The `avs_svg_provider` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) images into their applications. SVGs are widely used for their scalability and resolution independence, making them ideal for responsive designs. This package simplifies the process of loading and rendering SVG images, allowing developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about image quality across different screen sizes.

## When to Use `avs_svg_provider`

- **Responsive UI**: When building applications that require a responsive design, SVGs can adapt to different screen sizes without losing quality.
- **Iconography**: For applications that rely heavily on icons, SVGs provide a clean and scalable solution.
- **Animations**: SVGs can be animated, making them suitable for applications that require dynamic visual elements.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for loading SVG images from assets or network sources.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance, ensuring smooth rendering of SVG graphics.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of SVG properties, such as color and size, directly within the Flutter widget tree.

Overall, the `avs_svg_provider` package is an essential tool for Flutter developers who want to leverage the benefits of SVG graphics in their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using avs_svg_provider

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `avs_svg_provider` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `avs_svg_provider` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  avs_svg_provider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of SVG images by adding the following to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using avs_svg_provider

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:avs_svg_provider/avs_svg_provider.dart';
```

2. Use the `SvgProvider` widget to display an SVG image:

```dart
SvgProvider(
  asset: 'assets/images/example.svg', // Path to your SVG asset
  width: 100, // Set the desired width
  height: 100, // Set the desired height
)
```

3. You can also load SVGs from a network source:

```dart
SvgProvider(
  url: 'https://example.com/image.svg', // URL of the SVG image
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
)
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate SVG images into your Flutter application using the `avs_svg_provider` package.

# Complete Example of avs_svg_provider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:avs_svg_provider/avs_svg_provider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AVS SVG Provider Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('AVS SVG Provider Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying an SVG from assets
              SvgProvider(
                asset: 'assets/images/example.svg', // Path to your SVG asset
                width: 100, // Set the desired width
                height: 100, // Set the desired height
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between SVGs
              // Displaying an SVG from a network source
              SvgProvider(
                url: 'https://example.com/image.svg', // URL of the SVG image
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "AVS SVG Provider Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, two SvgProvider widgets are used to display SVG images:
//    - The first SvgProvider loads an SVG from the local assets.
//    - The second SvgProvider loads an SVG from a network URL.
// 6. A SizedBox is used to add space between the two SVG images for better visual separation.
```
