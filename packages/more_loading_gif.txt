# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using more_loading_gif

## Installation
To add the `more_loading_gif` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  more_loading_gif: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/more_loading_gif).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the following in your `Info.plist` to allow for network requests if your GIFs are loaded from the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `more_loading_gif` package, you can create a simple widget that displays a loading GIF. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:more_loading_gif/more_loading_gif.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Loading GIF Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: MoreLoadingGif(
          gifPath: 'assets/loading.gif', // Path to your GIF
          width: 100, // Width of the GIF
          height: 100, // Height of the GIF
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a centered loading GIF. You can customize the `gifPath`, `width`, and `height` as needed.

# Complete Example of more_loading_gif

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:more_loading_gif/more_loading_gif.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Loading GIF Example',
      home: LoadingScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class LoadingScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Loading GIF Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: MoreLoadingGif(
          gifPath: 'assets/loading.gif', // Path to your loading GIF
          width: 100, // Set the width of the GIF
          height: 100, // Set the height of the GIF
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The LoadingScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 4. Inside LoadingScreen, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a centered MoreLoadingGif widget.
// 5. The MoreLoadingGif widget takes a gifPath, width, and height as parameters to display the loading GIF.
// 6. This setup allows for a simple and effective loading indicator in the center of the screen.
