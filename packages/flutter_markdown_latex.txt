# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_markdown_latex

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_markdown_latex` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_markdown_latex` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_markdown_latex: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_markdown_latex).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Podfile` and ensure that the platform is set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_markdown_latex/flutter_markdown_latex.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `Markdown` widget provided by the package to render Markdown content with LaTeX support. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
Markdown(
  data: r"""
  # Hello, Flutter!
  
  Here is a LaTeX equation: 
  $$E = mc^2$$
  """,
)
```

This will render a header and a LaTeX equation in your Flutter app.

# Complete Example: A Flutter Application Using flutter_markdown_latex

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_markdown_latex/flutter_markdown_latex.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Markdown LaTeX Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Markdown with LaTeX'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Markdown(
            data: r"""
            # Welcome to RealFlutter
            
            This is a simple example of using the `flutter_markdown_latex` package.
            
            Here is a LaTeX equation:
            $$E = mc^2$$
            
            You can also include lists:
            - Item 1
            - Item 2
            - Item 3
            
            And more complex equations:
            $$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$
            """,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code defines a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the flutter_markdown_latex package.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Markdown with LaTeX".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a Padding widget that adds some space around the Markdown content.
// 5. The Markdown widget is used to render the Markdown text, which includes headers, LaTeX equations, and lists.
// 6. The LaTeX equations are rendered correctly, showcasing the package's capabilities to handle both Markdown and LaTeX syntax.
```
