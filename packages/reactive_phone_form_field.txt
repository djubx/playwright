# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Reactive Phone Form Field

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `reactive_phone_form_field` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  reactive_phone_form_field: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/reactive_phone_form_field).

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:reactive_phone_form_field/reactive_phone_form_field.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet if you plan to validate phone numbers against an API.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file to allow for network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `ReactivePhoneFormField` widget in your forms. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
ReactiveForm(
  formGroup: form,
  child: Column(
    children: [
      ReactivePhoneFormField(
        formControlName: 'phone',
        decoration: InputDecoration(
          labelText: 'Phone Number',
          hintText: 'Enter your phone number',
        ),
      ),
      ReactiveFormConsumer(
        builder: (context, form, child) {
          return ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: form.valid ? () => submitForm(form) : null,
            child: Text('Submit'),
          );
        },
      ),
    ],
  ),
);
```

In this example, we create a reactive form with a phone number input field. The button is enabled only when the form is valid.

## Step 5: Submitting the Form

You can handle form submission as follows:

```dart
void submitForm(FormGroup form) {
  // Handle form submission logic here
  print('Phone Number: ${form.control('phone').value}');
}
```

This function prints the phone number entered by the user.

By following these steps, you can easily integrate the `reactive_phone_form_field` package into your Flutter application, providing a robust solution for phone number input.

# Complete Example of Reactive Phone Form Field

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reactive_forms/reactive_forms.dart';
import 'package:reactive_phone_form_field/reactive_phone_form_field.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Reactive Phone Form Field Example',
      home: PhoneFormScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PhoneFormScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Step 1: Create a FormGroup to manage form state
  final FormGroup form = fb.group({
    'phone': FormControl<String>(validators: [Validators.required]),
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Phone Form Example'),
      ),
      body: ReactiveForm(
        formGroup: form,
        child: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Step 2: Add the ReactivePhoneFormField
              ReactivePhoneFormField(
                formControlName: 'phone',
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  labelText: 'Phone Number',
                  hintText: 'Enter your phone number',
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Step 3: Add a submit button
              ReactiveFormConsumer(
                builder: (context, form, child) {
                  return ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: form.valid ? () => submitForm(form) : null,
                    child: Text('Submit'),
                  );
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Step 4: Handle form submission
  void submitForm(FormGroup form) {
    // Print the phone number to the console
    print('Phone Number: ${form.control('phone').value}');
  }
}

// Step 5: Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// The PhoneFormScreen class contains a ReactiveForm with a FormGroup to manage the state of the form.
// The ReactivePhoneFormField widget is used to create a phone number input field.
// The form is validated, and the submit button is enabled only when the form is valid.
// Upon clicking the submit button, the phone number is printed to the console.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this complete example, we have created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `reactive_phone_form_field` package. The application consists of a single screen with a phone number input field and a submit button. 

### Application Flow Summary

- The app starts with the `MyApp` class, which initializes the `MaterialApp`.
- The `PhoneFormScreen` class contains a `ReactiveForm` that manages the form state using a `FormGroup`.
- The `ReactivePhoneFormField` widget is used to create a phone number input field, which automatically formats and validates the input.
- The submit button is enabled only when the form is valid, ensuring that users cannot submit invalid data.
- When the button is pressed, the entered phone number is printed to the console, demonstrating how to handle form submission.

This structured approach provides a comprehensive understanding of how to implement and utilize the `reactive_phone_form_field` package in a Flutter application.
