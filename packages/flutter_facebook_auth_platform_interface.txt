// This is the main file that demonstrates the usage of the flutter_facebook_auth_platform_interface package.
// It creates a simple Flutter app with two buttons: "Login with Facebook" and "Logout".
// When the "Login with Facebook" button is pressed, it calls the login method of the FacebookAuth instance to perform the login.
// If the login is successful, it prints the access token to the console.
// When the "Logout" button is pressed, it calls the logOut method of the FacebookAuth instance to perform the logout.
// The app uses the Material theme and has a basic layout with a centered column of buttons.

// To use this code, create a new Flutter project and replace the contents of the lib/main.dart file with this code.
// Make sure to add the flutter_facebook_auth_platform_interface package to your pubspec.yaml file and run flutter pub get to install it.
// Also, make sure to configure the Facebook app ID and secret in the Info.plist file (for iOS) or the AndroidManifest.xml file (for Android).

// Note: This code is just a demonstration and you should handle the errors and exceptions properly in a real-world app.
// Also, you should use the access token to authenticate with your server and not print it to the console.
