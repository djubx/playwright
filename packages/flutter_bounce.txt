# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_bounce

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_bounce` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_bounce: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using flutter_bounce

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a bounce effect on a button:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bounce/flutter_bounce.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Bounce Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Bounce(
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 150),
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: Colors.blue,
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
              ),
              child: Text(
                'Bounce Me!',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple button that bounces when pressed. The `Bounce` widget wraps around a `Container`, and we specify the duration of the bounce effect.

# Complete Example of flutter_bounce

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bounce/flutter_bounce.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Bounce Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Bounce(
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 150), // Duration of the bounce effect
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Button Pressed!'); // Log message on button press
            },
            child: Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(20), // Padding around the text
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the button
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10), // Rounded corners
              ),
              child: Text(
                'Bounce Me!', // Text displayed on the button
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20), // Text style
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center, a Bounce widget wraps a Container.
// 5. The Bounce widget has a duration of 150 milliseconds for the bounce effect.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback, printing 'Button Pressed!' to the console.
// 7. The Container has padding, a blue background, and rounded corners, displaying the text 'Bounce Me!'.
```

In summary, the `flutter_bounce` package provides an easy way to add engaging bounce animations to your Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, you can enhance the interactivity of your UI elements, making your app feel more responsive and lively.
