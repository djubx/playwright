# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Wolt Responsive Layout Grid Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `wolt_responsive_layout_grid` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wolt_responsive_layout_grid: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a responsive grid layout using the `wolt_responsive_layout_grid` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wolt_responsive_layout_grid/wolt_responsive_layout_grid.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Wolt Responsive Layout Grid Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Responsive Grid Example'),
        ),
        body: ResponsiveLayoutGrid(
          // Define the number of columns for different screen sizes
          columns: {
            Breakpoint.xs: 2, // Extra small devices
            Breakpoint.sm: 3, // Small devices
            Breakpoint.md: 4, // Medium devices
            Breakpoint.lg: 5, // Large devices
          },
          children: List.generate(20, (index) {
            return Container(
              margin: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
              color: Colors.blueAccent,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Item $index',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            );
          }),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a responsive grid layout that adjusts the number of columns based on the screen size. The `ResponsiveLayoutGrid` widget takes a map of breakpoints and the corresponding number of columns for each breakpoint.

# Complete Example: Main File

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wolt_responsive_layout_grid/wolt_responsive_layout_grid.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Wolt Responsive Layout Grid Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Responsive Grid Example'),
        ),
        body: ResponsiveLayoutGrid(
          // Define the number of columns for different screen sizes
          columns: {
            Breakpoint.xs: 2, // Extra small devices
            Breakpoint.sm: 3, // Small devices
            Breakpoint.md: 4, // Medium devices
            Breakpoint.lg: 5, // Large devices
          },
          children: List.generate(20, (index) {
            return Container(
              margin: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
              color: Colors.blueAccent,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Item $index',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            );
          }),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The application starts by running the main function, which calls runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold.
// Inside the scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Responsive Grid Example'.
// The body of the scaffold contains a ResponsiveLayoutGrid widget.
// The ResponsiveLayoutGrid defines the number of columns for different screen sizes using breakpoints.
// It generates a list of 20 items, each represented by a Container with a blue background and centered text.
// The layout automatically adjusts the number of columns based on the screen size, providing a responsive design.
