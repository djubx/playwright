<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# flutter_env_native Package Overview

The `flutter_env_native` package is a powerful tool for managing environment variables in Flutter applications. It allows developers to define and access environment-specific configurations seamlessly, making it easier to manage different settings for development, staging, and production environments. This package is particularly useful for applications that require different API endpoints, feature flags, or any other configuration that varies across environments.

## When to Use `flutter_env_native`

- **Environment-Specific Configurations**: When your application needs to switch configurations based on the environment (development, staging, production).
- **Sensitive Information Management**: To manage sensitive information like API keys without hardcoding them into your source code.
- **Simplified Configuration Management**: When you want to avoid cluttering your code with multiple configuration checks.

## Features

- **Native Environment Variable Access**: Access environment variables defined in native code (Android and iOS).
- **Easy Setup**: Simple integration with existing Flutter projects.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

By leveraging the `flutter_env_native` package, developers can ensure that their applications are flexible and maintainable, adapting easily to different deployment scenarios.

# Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_env_native` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_env_native` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_env_native: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Add the following lines to define your environment variables:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    buildTypes {
        debug {
            buildConfigField "String", "API_URL", "\"https://dev.api.example.com\""
        }
        release {
            buildConfigField "String", "API_URL", "\"https://api.example.com\""
        }
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
2. Go to the `Info.plist` file and add your environment variables:

```xml
<key>API_URL</key>
<string>https://api.example.com</string>
```

For different configurations, you can create separate `.xcconfig` files for Debug and Release configurations.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to access the environment variables:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_env_native/flutter_env_native.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Access the API_URL environment variable
    final apiUrl = FlutterEnvNative.get('API_URL');

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Environment Variable Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('API URL: $apiUrl'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the `flutter_env_native` package and use the `FlutterEnvNative.get` method to retrieve the `API_URL` environment variable. This value is then displayed in the app's UI.

# Complete Example of flutter_env_native

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_env_native/flutter_env_native.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Access the API_URL environment variable
    final apiUrl = FlutterEnvNative.get('API_URL');

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Environment Variable Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('API URL: $apiUrl'), // Display the API URL
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // Initialize the Flutter environment
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. It calls runApp() with an instance of RealFlutter.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp.
// 4. Inside the build method, we retrieve the API_URL environment variable using FlutterEnvNative.get().
// 5. The retrieved API URL is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 6. The app's UI consists of a simple AppBar and a centered Text widget showing the API URL.
```
