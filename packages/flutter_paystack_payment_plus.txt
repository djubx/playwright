# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_paystack_payment_plus

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_paystack_payment_plus` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `flutter_paystack_payment_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_paystack_payment_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_paystack_payment_plus).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode and your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0.

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_paystack_payment_plus/flutter_paystack_payment_plus.dart';
```

2. Initialize the Paystack SDK with your public key:

```dart
PaystackPlugin.initialize(publicKey: 'your_public_key');
```

3. Create a payment method:

```dart
void startPayment() async {
  final response = await PaystackPlugin.checkout(
    context,
    publicKey: 'your_public_key',
    currency: 'NGN',
    amount: 10000, // Amount in kobo
    email: 'customer@example.com',
  );

  if (response.status) {
    // Payment was successful
    print('Payment successful: ${response.reference}');
  } else {
    // Payment failed
    print('Payment failed: ${response.message}');
  }
}
```

With these steps, you can successfully integrate Paystack payment processing into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example: A Functional Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_paystack_payment_plus/flutter_paystack_payment_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Paystack Payment Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Paystack with your public key
    PaystackPlugin.initialize(publicKey: 'your_public_key');
  }

  void startPayment() async {
    // Start the payment process
    final response = await PaystackPlugin.checkout(
      context,
      publicKey: 'your_public_key',
      currency: 'NGN',
      amount: 10000, // Amount in kobo
      email: 'customer@example.com',
    );

    // Check if the payment was successful
    if (response.status) {
      // Payment was successful
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Payment successful: ${response.reference}')),
      );
    } else {
      // Payment failed
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Payment failed: ${response.message}')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Paystack Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: startPayment, // Trigger payment on button press
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (PaymentScreen).
// 3. In the PaymentScreen, we initialize the Paystack SDK with the public key in initState.
// 4. When the user presses the "Pay Now" button, the startPayment method is called.
// 5. The startPayment method triggers the Paystack checkout process, passing the necessary parameters.
// 6. If the payment is successful, a success message is shown; otherwise, a failure message is displayed.
