# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Carousel Images Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `carousel_images` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  carousel_images: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:carousel_images/carousel_images.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Carousel
You can now use the `CarouselImages` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
CarouselImages(
  images: [
    'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
  ],
  height: 200,
  autoPlay: true,
  indicatorBgPadding: 5.0,
  dotBgColor: Colors.transparent,
  dotColor: Colors.white,
),
```

This code snippet creates a carousel that automatically plays through three images, with a height of 200 pixels.

# Complete Example of Carousel Images in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:carousel_images/carousel_images.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Carousel Images Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Carousel Images Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CarouselImages(
            // List of image URLs to display in the carousel
            images: [
              'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
              'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
              'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
            ],
            height: 200, // Height of the carousel
            autoPlay: true, // Enable auto-play feature
            indicatorBgPadding: 5.0, // Padding around the indicator
            dotBgColor: Colors.transparent, // Background color of the indicator
            dotColor: Colors.white, // Color of the indicator dots
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Carousel Images Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers the CarouselImages widget.
// 5. The CarouselImages widget takes a list of image URLs, sets the height, enables auto-play, and customizes the indicator's appearance.
// 6. When the app runs, users will see a carousel of images that automatically transitions between them, providing an engaging visual experience.
```
