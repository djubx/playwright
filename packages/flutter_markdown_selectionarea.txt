# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_markdown_selectionarea

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_markdown_selectionarea` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_markdown_selectionarea` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_markdown_selectionarea: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_markdown_selectionarea).

## Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if you plan to use features like sharing. Add the following lines to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to share images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take pictures.</string>
```

// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Markdown Selection Area".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Padding widget that adds space around the content.
// 5. Inside the Padding, we use the MarkdownSelectionArea widget to display Markdown content.
// 6. The data property contains the Markdown text to be rendered.
// 7. The styleSheet property allows customization of the text styles for headers and paragraphs.
