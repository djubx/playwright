# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Dual Screen Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **dual_screen** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dual_screen: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dual_screen).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions to support dual-screen features:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

3. Ensure your app's theme supports dual-screen layouts by adding the following to your `styles.xml`:

```xml
<item name="android:windowMultiWindowStyle">@style/Theme.AppCompat.NoActionBar</item>
```

### iOS

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to support multitasking:

```xml
<key>UISupportedInterfaceOrientations</key>
<array>
    <string>UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait</string>
    <string>UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft</string>
    <string>UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a dual-screen layout.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dual_screen/dual_screen.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: DualScreenView(
        builder: (context, screen) {
          return Scaffold(
            appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dual Screen Example')),
            body: Row(
              children: [
                Expanded(
                  child: Container(
                    color: Colors.blue,
                    child: Center(child: Text('Screen 1')),
                  ),
                ),
                if (screen.isDualScreen)
                  Expanded(
                    child: Container(
                      color: Colors.green,
                      child: Center(child: Text('Screen 2')),
                    ),
                  ),
              ],
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple dual-screen application that displays different content on each screen if the device supports dual screens.

# Complete Example of a Dual Screen Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dual_screen/dual_screen.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: DualScreenView(
        builder: (context, screen) {
          return Scaffold(
            appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dual Screen Example')),
            body: Row(
              children: [
                // First screen container
                Expanded(
                  child: Container(
                    color: Colors.blue,
                    child: Center(child: Text('Screen 1')),
                  ),
                ),
                // Check if the device is dual-screen
                if (screen.isDualScreen)
                  Expanded(
                    child: Container(
                      color: Colors.green,
                      child: Center(child: Text('Screen 2')),
                    ),
                  ),
              ],
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. Inside the build method, we create a MaterialApp that hosts a DualScreenView.
// 3. The DualScreenView provides a builder function that gives us access to the current screen configuration.
// 4. We use a Row widget to arrange the content horizontally.
// 5. The first screen is always displayed with a blue background and the text "Screen 1".
// 6. If the device is dual-screen (checked using screen.isDualScreen), we display a second screen with a green background and the text "Screen 2".
// 7. This layout allows for a responsive design that adapts to the device's capabilities, enhancing user experience.
```
