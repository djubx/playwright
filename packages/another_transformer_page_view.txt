  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  another_transformer_page_view: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:another_transformer_page_view/another_transformer_page_view.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `AnotherTransformerPageView` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AnotherTransformerPageView(
  itemCount: 3,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return Container(
      color: index.isEven ? Colors.blue : Colors.red,
      child: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Page $index',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
        ),
      ),
    );
  },
  transformer: PageTransformerBuilder(
    // Define your custom transformer here
  ),
)
```

This code snippet creates a page view with three pages, alternating between blue and red backgrounds.

# Complete Example of Another Transformer Page View

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:another_transformer_page_view/another_transformer_page_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Another Transformer Page View Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Transformer Page View'),
        ),
        body: AnotherTransformerPageView(
          itemCount: 3, // Total number of pages
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            // Building each page
            return Container(
              color: index.isEven ? Colors.blue : Colors.red, // Alternate colors
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Page $index', // Display page number
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
            );
          },
          transformer: PageTransformerBuilder(
            // Define the page transition effect
            // For example, you can use a zoom effect
            transitionBuilder: (child, value) {
              return Transform.scale(
                scale: 1 - (value.abs() * 0.2), // Scale effect
                child: child,
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Transformer Page View'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains the AnotherTransformerPageView widget.
// 5. The itemCount is set to 3, indicating three pages will be displayed.
// 6. The itemBuilder function constructs each page, alternating colors between blue and red.
// 7. The transformer property is set to a PageTransformerBuilder, which defines a custom transition effect.
// 8. The transitionBuilder applies a scale transformation to create a zoom effect as the pages transition.
