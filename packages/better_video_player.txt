```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:better_video_player/better_video_player.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Better Video Player Example',
      home: VideoPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoPlayerScreenState createState() => _VideoPlayerScreenState();
}

class _VideoPlayerScreenState extends State<VideoPlayerScreen> {
  late BetterVideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the video player controller with a video URL
    _controller = BetterVideoPlayerController.network(
      'https://www.example.com/video.mp4',
      // Optional: Set additional configurations
      betterVideoPlayerConfiguration: BetterVideoPlayerConfiguration(
        autoPlay: true, // Automatically play the video
        looping: true, // Loop the video
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Better Video Player'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Use BetterVideoPlayer widget to display the video
        child: BetterVideoPlayer(controller: _controller),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The VideoPlayerScreen widget is created, which manages the video player state.
// 4. In the initState method, a BetterVideoPlayerController is initialized with a video URL.
// 5. The controller is configured to auto-play and loop the video.
// 6. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing the BetterVideoPlayer.
// 7. When the widget is disposed, the controller is also disposed to free up resources.
```

### Summary of Application Flow

The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget. The `RealFlutter` widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with a title and a home screen that displays the `VideoPlayerScreen`. In the `VideoPlayerScreen`, the `BetterVideoPlayerController` is created in the `initState` method, pointing to a video URL. The video is set to auto-play and loop. The `BetterVideoPlayer` widget is then rendered in the center of the screen. Finally, when the screen is removed, the controller is disposed of to prevent memory leaks.
