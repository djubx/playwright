# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Proste Route Animation

## Installation
To get started with `proste_route_animation`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  proste_route_animation: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/proste_route_animation).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
To use `proste_route_animation`, you will need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:proste_route_animation/proste_route_animation.dart';
```

You can then use the `ProsteRouteAnimation` class to create custom route transitions. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to navigate between two screens with a fade transition:

```dart
Navigator.of(context).push(
  ProsteRouteAnimation(
    page: SecondScreen(),
    animationType: AnimationType.fade,
  ),
);
```

This will push `SecondScreen` onto the navigation stack with a fade animation.

# Complete Example: Using Proste Route Animation in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:proste_route_animation/proste_route_animation.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Proste Route Animation Demo',
      home: FirstScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FirstScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('First Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the second screen with a fade animation
            Navigator.of(context).push(
              ProsteRouteAnimation(
                page: SecondScreen(),
                animationType: AnimationType.fade,
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate back to the first screen with a slide animation
            Navigator.of(context).pop();
          },
          child: Text('Back to First Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home screen is FirstScreen, which contains a button to navigate to SecondScreen.
// 3. When the button is pressed, it triggers a navigation event using ProsteRouteAnimation with a fade effect.
// 4. SecondScreen is displayed, which has a button to return to FirstScreen.
// 5. Pressing the back button pops the current screen off the stack, returning to FirstScreen.
