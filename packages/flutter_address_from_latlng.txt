# flutter_address_from_latlng Package Overview

The `flutter_address_from_latlng` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows you to convert latitude and longitude coordinates into human-readable addresses. This functionality is particularly useful in applications that require location-based services, such as ride-sharing apps, delivery services, or any app that needs to display user locations on a map.

## When to Use This Package
- **Location-Based Services**: When you need to display addresses based on user location.
- **Geocoding**: For applications that require reverse geocoding to convert coordinates into addresses.
- **Mapping Applications**: When integrating with mapping services to provide users with address information.

## Key Features
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API to convert latitude and longitude to addresses.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Customizable**: Allows for customization of the address format and components.

Overall, this package simplifies the process of obtaining address information from geographic coordinates, making it an essential tool for many Flutter applications.

# Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To use the `flutter_address_from_latlng` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_address_from_latlng: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_address_from_latlng).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide address information.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide address information.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you can create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and call the method to get the address from latitude and longitude.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_address_from_latlng/flutter_address_from_latlng.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Address from LatLng')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Example coordinates
              double latitude = 37.4219983;
              double longitude = -122.084;
              
              // Fetch address from coordinates
              String address = await AddressFromLatLng.getAddressFromLatLng(latitude, longitude);
              print(address); // Display the address
            },
            child: Text('Get Address'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application that retrieves an address based on specified latitude and longitude when a button is pressed.

# Complete Example of flutter_address_from_latlng

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_address_from_latlng/flutter_address_from_latlng.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Address from LatLng')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the latitude and longitude
              double latitude = 37.4219983; // Example latitude
              double longitude = -122.084; // Example longitude
              
              // Fetch the address using the package
              String address = await AddressFromLatLng.getAddressFromLatLng(latitude, longitude);
              
              // Display the address in a dialog
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) {
                  return AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Address'),
                    content: Text(address), // Show the fetched address
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () {
                          Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                        },
                        child: Text('OK'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  );
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Get Address'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers an asynchronous function to fetch the address.
// 5. The latitude and longitude are defined as example coordinates.
// 6. The getAddressFromLatLng method is called to retrieve the address.
// 7. Once the address is fetched, an AlertDialog is displayed showing the address.
// 8. The user can dismiss the dialog by pressing the 'OK' button.
