```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bootstrap_icons/bootstrap_icons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bootstrap Icons Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Bootstrap Icons Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display a heart icon
              Icon(BootstrapIcons.heart, size: 48),
              SizedBox(height: 16),
              // Display a star icon
              Icon(BootstrapIcons.star, size: 48),
              SizedBox(height: 16),
              // Display a bell icon
              Icon(BootstrapIcons.bell, size: 48),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and the `RealFlutter` widget is displayed.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a `MaterialApp` with a `Scaffold` as its home.
// 3. The `Scaffold` has an `AppBar` with a title and a body that displays a column of icons.
// 4. Each icon is displayed using the `Icon` widget and the `BootstrapIcons` class.
// 5. The user can view the icons and interact with the app as needed.

// Final summary: This code demonstrates how to use the `bootstrap_icons` package in a Flutter app.
// It displays a column of icons using the `Icon` widget and the `BootstrapIcons` class.
