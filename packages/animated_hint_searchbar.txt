# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using animated_hint_searchbar

```yaml
dependencies:
  animated_hint_searchbar: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/animated_hint_searchbar).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for any necessary permissions, depending on your app's requirements.

## Basic Usage
To use the `animated_hint_searchbar`, you can create a simple widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_hint_searchbar/animated_hint_searchbar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Hint Search Bar Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedHintSearchBar(
            hintText: 'Search...',
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Handle search logic here
              print('Search query: $value');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with an `AppBar` and a centered `AnimatedHintSearchBar`. The `onChanged` callback allows you to handle the search input dynamically.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `animated_hint_searchbar` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of animated_hint_searchbar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_hint_searchbar/animated_hint_searchbar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Hint Search Bar Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedHintSearchBar(
            hintText: 'Search...',
            onChanged: (value) {
              // This callback is triggered whenever the text in the search bar changes.
              // You can implement your search logic here.
              print('Search query: $value');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function calls runApp, which initializes the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Animated Hint Search Bar Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, we center the AnimatedHintSearchBar widget.
// 5. The AnimatedHintSearchBar displays a hint text 'Search...' and listens for changes in the input.
// 6. Whenever the user types in the search bar, the onChanged callback is triggered, printing the current search query to the console.
