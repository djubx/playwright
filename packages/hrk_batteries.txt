# hrk_batteries Flutter Package

The `hrk_batteries` package is a powerful utility designed to simplify battery management in Flutter applications. It provides developers with an easy way to access battery information, monitor battery status, and respond to changes in battery state. This package is particularly useful for applications that require battery level awareness, such as mobile games, fitness trackers, or any app that needs to optimize performance based on battery conditions.

## When to Use hrk_batteries
- **Battery Monitoring**: If your app needs to display the current battery level or status (charging, discharging, etc.).
- **Performance Optimization**: To adjust app behavior based on battery conditions, such as reducing background activity when the battery is low.
- **User Notifications**: To inform users about battery status changes, enhancing user experience.

## Features
- **Real-time Battery Level**: Get the current battery level as a percentage.
- **Battery State Monitoring**: Listen for changes in battery state (charging, discharging, full, etc.).
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for quick setup and usage.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using hrk_batteries

## Installation
To add the `hrk_batteries` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hrk_batteries: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/hrk_batteries).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions to access battery information. Add the following line within the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BATTERY_STATS"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, no additional configuration is required. The package works out of the box as long as you have the necessary Flutter setup.

## Using hrk_batteries
To use the `hrk_batteries` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:hrk_batteries/hrk_batteries.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class to start monitoring battery status.

```dart
void main() {
  RealFlutter().init();
}
```

This will initialize the battery monitoring and allow you to access battery information.

# Complete Example of hrk_batteries

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hrk_batteries/hrk_batteries.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Battery Status App',
      home: BatteryStatusScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class BatteryStatusScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BatteryStatusScreenState createState() => _BatteryStatusScreenState();
}

class _BatteryStatusScreenState extends State<BatteryStatusScreen> {
  int _batteryLevel = 0; // Variable to hold the battery level
  String _batteryState = 'Unknown'; // Variable to hold the battery state

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the battery monitoring
    RealFlutter().init();
    // Listen for battery level changes
    RealFlutter().onBatteryLevelChanged.listen((level) {
      setState(() {
        _batteryLevel = level; // Update the battery level
      });
    });
    // Listen for battery state changes
    RealFlutter().onBatteryStateChanged.listen((state) {
      setState(() {
        _batteryState = state; // Update the battery state
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Battery Status'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Battery Level: $_batteryLevel%'), // Display battery level
            Text('Battery State: $_batteryState'), // Display battery state
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (BatteryStatusScreen).
// 3. BatteryStatusScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages battery information.
// 4. In the initState method, we initialize the battery monitoring using RealFlutter().init().
// 5. We set up listeners for battery level and state changes, updating the state variables accordingly.
// 6. The build method displays the current battery level and state in the center of the screen.
