# Setting Up and Using the "layoutr" Package

## Installation
To get started with the `layoutr` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  layoutr: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package. After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter and the `layoutr` package. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a responsive layout using `layoutr`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:layoutr/layoutr.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Layoutr Example')),
        body: LayoutBuilder(
          builder: (context, constraints) {
            return ResponsiveLayout(
              mobile: MobileLayout(),
              tablet: TabletLayout(),
              desktop: DesktopLayout(),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MobileLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(child: Text('Mobile Layout'));
  }
}

class TabletLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(child: Text('Tablet Layout'));
  }
}

class DesktopLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(child: Text('Desktop Layout'));
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ResponsiveLayout` widget automatically selects the appropriate layout based on the screen size.

# Complete Example of Using the "layoutr" Package

import 'package:layoutr/layoutr.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Layoutr Example')),
        body: LayoutBuilder(
          builder: (context, constraints) {
            // Using ResponsiveLayout to determine which layout to show
            return ResponsiveLayout(
              mobile: MobileLayout(), // Layout for mobile devices
              tablet: TabletLayout(), // Layout for tablet devices
              desktop: DesktopLayout(), // Layout for desktop devices
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MobileLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Simple mobile layout with centered text
    return Center(child: Text('Mobile Layout'));
  }
}

class TabletLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Simple tablet layout with centered text
    return Center(child: Text('Tablet Layout'));
  }
}

class DesktopLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Simple desktop layout with centered text
    return Center(child: Text('Desktop Layout'));
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the app's visual structure, including an AppBar.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold uses a LayoutBuilder to determine the available constraints.
// 5. Based on the constraints, the ResponsiveLayout widget selects the appropriate layout:
//    - MobileLayout for small screens
//    - TabletLayout for medium screens
//    - DesktopLayout for large screens
// 6. Each layout class (MobileLayout, TabletLayout, DesktopLayout) returns a simple centered text widget indicating the current layout type.
