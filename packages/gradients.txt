# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Gradients Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the Gradients package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gradients: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Gradients Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a gradient background for your main screen:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gradients/gradients.dart'; // Import the gradients package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: GradientHome(),
    );
  }
}

class GradientHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Container(
        // Use the GradientContainer widget from the package
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          gradient: LinearGradient(
            colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
            begin: Alignment.topLeft,
            end: Alignment.bottomRight,
          ),
        ),
        child: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Hello, Gradients!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application with a gradient background. You can customize the colors and gradient types as needed.

# Complete Example of Using the Gradients Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gradients/gradients.dart'; // Import the gradients package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the app with the main class RealFlutter
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gradients Example',
      home: GradientHome(), // Set the home to the GradientHome widget
    );
  }
}

class GradientHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Gradients in Flutter'), // Title of the app bar
      ),
      body: Container(
        // Container to hold the gradient background
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          gradient: LinearGradient(
            colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple], // Define gradient colors
            begin: Alignment.topLeft, // Start point of the gradient
            end: Alignment.bottomRight, // End point of the gradient
          ),
        ),
        child: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Welcome to RealFlutter!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white), // Text style
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between text and button
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action when button is pressed
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Press Me'), // Button text
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter class.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. The GradientHome widget is displayed as the home screen, which contains a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold has an AppBar with a title and a body that contains a Container.
// 5. The Container has a linear gradient background defined by two colors: blue and purple.
// 6. Inside the Container, a Center widget is used to align its children in the center.
// 7. A Column widget holds a welcome text and a button.
// 8. When the button is pressed, a SnackBar is displayed at the bottom of the screen.
```
