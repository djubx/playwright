In this code, we first load the PyTorch model from the asset using the `PyTorchModel.fromAsset` method. Then, we run the PyTorch model using the `run` method and process the output. The application flow is controlled by two buttons: "Load Model" and "Run Model". When the user clicks the "Load Model" button, the PyTorch model is loaded from the asset. When the user clicks the "Run Model" button, the PyTorch model is run, and the output is processed.
