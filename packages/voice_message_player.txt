# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Voice Message Player

## Installation
To get started with the `voice_message_player` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  voice_message_player: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/voice_message_player).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

2. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21.

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to record voice messages.</string>
<key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your music library to play audio messages.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `voice_message_player` package in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:voice_message_player/voice_message_player.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late VoiceMessagePlayer _player;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _player = VoiceMessagePlayer();
  }

  void _playVoiceMessage(String url) {
    _player.play(url);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _player.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Voice Message Player')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => _playVoiceMessage('https://example.com/voice.mp3'),
          child: Text('Play Voice Message'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple UI with a button that plays a voice message when pressed. The `VoiceMessagePlayer` instance is initialized in `initState` and disposed of in `dispose` to free up resources.

# Complete Example of Voice Message Player

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:voice_message_player/voice_message_player.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late VoiceMessagePlayer _player; // Declare the voice message player

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _player = VoiceMessagePlayer(); // Initialize the player
  }

  // Function to play the voice message from a given URL
  void _playVoiceMessage(String url) {
    _player.play(url); // Call the play method on the player
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _player.dispose(); // Dispose of the player to free resources
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Voice Message Player')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => _playVoiceMessage('https://example.com/voice.mp3'), // Play voice message on button press
          child: Text('Play Voice Message'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget being created.
// 2. In the initState method, we initialize the VoiceMessagePlayer instance.
// 3. When the user presses the "Play Voice Message" button, the _playVoiceMessage method is called with a URL.
// 4. The VoiceMessagePlayer plays the audio from the provided URL.
// 5. When the widget is disposed, we ensure to call dispose on the player to release resources.
