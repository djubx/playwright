# Setting Up and Using `image_picker_web`

In this section, we'll walk through the setup process for the `image_picker_web` package and demonstrate how to integrate it into a Flutter web project.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `image_picker_web` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     image_picker_web: ^2.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package to use its functionalities.

   ```dart
   import 'package:image_picker_web/image_picker_web.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Web

- The `image_picker_web` package is specifically designed for web applications, so no additional platform-specific setup is required for web.

### Android and iOS

- Since `image_picker_web` is tailored for web, it is not intended for use in Android or iOS applications. For mobile platforms, consider using the `image_picker` package instead.

## Basic Usage

To use the `image_picker_web` package, you can call its methods to open a file picker dialog and handle the selected image.

```dart
Future<void> pickImage() async {
  final image = await ImagePickerWeb.getImageAsBytes();
  if (image != null) {
    // Handle the selected image
  }
}
```

# Complete Example Using `image_picker_web`

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `image_picker_web` package. This example demonstrates how to pick an image and display it on the screen.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_picker_web/image_picker_web.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Picker Web Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ImagePickerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class ImagePickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImagePickerDemoState createState() => _ImagePickerDemoState();
}

class _ImagePickerDemoState extends State<ImagePickerDemo> {
  // Variable to store the selected image
  Image? _selectedImage;

  // Function to pick an image
  Future<void> _pickImage() async {
    // Use the image_picker_web package to pick an image
    final imageBytes = await ImagePickerWeb.getImageAsBytes();
    if (imageBytes != null) {
      // If an image is selected, update the state to display it
      setState(() {
        _selectedImage = Image.memory(imageBytes);
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Picker Web Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the selected image or a placeholder
            _selectedImage ?? Text('No image selected.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to trigger image picking
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImage,
              child: Text('Pick Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// `RealFlutter` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a home page of `ImagePickerDemo`.
// `ImagePickerDemo` is a stateful widget that manages the state of the selected image.
// The `_pickImage` function uses `ImagePickerWeb.getImageAsBytes()` to open a file picker and select an image.
// If an image is selected, it updates the `_selectedImage` state to display the image using `Image.memory`.
// The UI consists of a column with the selected image (or a placeholder) and a button to pick an image.
// When the button is pressed, `_pickImage` is called to allow the user to select an image.
