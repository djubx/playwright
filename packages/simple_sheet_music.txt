# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using simple_sheet_music

## Installation
To get started with the `simple_sheet_music` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_sheet_music: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/simple_sheet_music).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow for any necessary permissions, especially if you plan to access device features.

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to render sheet music.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_sheet_music/simple_sheet_music.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sheet Music Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SheetMusic(
            sheet: 'path/to/your/sheet/music/file', // Path to your sheet music file
            width: 300, // Width of the sheet music display
            height: 400, // Height of the sheet music display
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays sheet music using the `SheetMusic` widget from the `simple_sheet_music` package. Make sure to replace `'path/to/your/sheet/music/file'` with the actual path to your sheet music file.

# Complete Example of simple_sheet_music

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_sheet_music/simple_sheet_music.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sheet Music Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the SheetMusic widget
          child: SheetMusic(
            sheet: 'assets/sheet_music/example_sheet.musicxml', // Path to your sheet music file
            width: 300, // Width of the sheet music display
            height: 400, // Height of the sheet music display
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, we create a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the app.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. The SheetMusic widget is used to render the sheet music, where we specify the path to the music file and its dimensions.
// 7. Finally, the runApp function is called to launch the app.
