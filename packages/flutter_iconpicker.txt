# Setting Up and Using Flutter IconPicker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `flutter_iconpicker` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup

1. **Add Dependency**

   First, add the `flutter_iconpicker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_iconpicker: ^3.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**

   Run the following command to install the new package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

No additional configuration is required for Android. Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your `ios/Podfile` has platform set to at least 11.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

## Using the Package

To use the `flutter_iconpicker`, you need to import it and then call the icon picker function within your widget. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_iconpicker/flutter_iconpicker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  IconData _icon;

  void _pickIcon() async {
    IconData icon = await FlutterIconPicker.showIconPicker(context);
    setState(() {
      _icon = icon;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Icon Picker Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            IconButton(
              icon: Icon(_icon ?? Icons.add),
              onPressed: _pickIcon,
              iconSize: 50.0,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Tap the icon to pick a new one'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_iconpicker/flutter_iconpicker.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() => runApp(MyApp());

// Root widget of the application
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter IconPicker Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

// Stateful widget to manage the icon picking functionality
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

// State class for RealFlutter widget
class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  IconData _icon; // Variable to store the selected icon

  // Function to open the icon picker and update the selected icon
  void _pickIcon() async {
    IconData icon = await FlutterIconPicker.showIconPicker(context);
    setState(() {
      _icon = icon; // Update the state with the new icon
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Icon Picker Example')), // App bar with title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            IconButton(
              icon: Icon(_icon ?? Icons.add), // Display the selected icon or a default one
              onPressed: _pickIcon, // Trigger icon picker on button press
              iconSize: 50.0, // Size of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between icon and text
            Text('Tap the icon to pick a new one'), // Instructional text
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The application starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is the home screen, which is a stateful widget.
// 3. The _RealFlutterState manages the state of the icon picker.
// 4. When the IconButton is pressed, the _pickIcon function is called.
// 5. The _pickIcon function uses FlutterIconPicker to show the icon picker dialog.
// 6. Once an icon is selected, the state is updated, and the selected icon is displayed.
// 7. The UI updates automatically to reflect the new icon selection.
```
