# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Preferences Local Storage Inspector

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `preferences_local_storage_inspector` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `preferences_local_storage_inspector` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  preferences_local_storage_inspector: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow local storage access. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. The following sections will demonstrate how to implement the package in a simple Flutter app.

# Complete Example of Preferences Local Storage Inspector

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:preferences_local_storage_inspector/preferences_local_storage_inspector.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Preferences Local Storage Inspector',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Initialize the inspector
  final PreferencesLocalStorageInspector inspector = PreferencesLocalStorageInspector();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start the inspector to monitor local storage
    inspector.start();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop the inspector when the widget is disposed
    inspector.stop();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Local Storage Inspector'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Example of setting a preference
            inspector.setString('example_key', 'example_value');
            // Show a snackbar to confirm the action
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Preference set!')),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Set Preference'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is set as the home of the app.
// 4. In the HomeScreen state, we create an instance of PreferencesLocalStorageInspector.
// 5. The inspector is started in the initState method, allowing it to monitor local storage.
// 6. When the button is pressed, a preference is set using the inspector, and a snackbar confirms the action.
// 7. The inspector is stopped in the dispose method to clean up resources when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
