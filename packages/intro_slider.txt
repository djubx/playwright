# Introduction to the "intro_slider" Flutter Package

The `intro_slider` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create engaging onboarding experiences for their applications. This package allows you to create a series of slides that can introduce users to the app's features, guiding them through the initial setup or highlighting key functionalities.

## When to Use `intro_slider`

You should consider using the `intro_slider` package in scenarios such as:
- **Onboarding New Users**: When you want to provide a guided introduction to your app's features.
- **Feature Highlights**: To showcase new features after an update.
- **User Engagement**: To improve user retention by making the first-time experience more interactive.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Slides**: You can easily customize the appearance of each slide, including images, text, and buttons.
- **Skip and Next Buttons**: Built-in navigation options allow users to skip or proceed through the slides.
- **Page Indicators**: Visual indicators show users their current position in the onboarding process.
- **Full-Screen Support**: Slides can be displayed in full-screen mode for a more immersive experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `intro_slider` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `intro_slider` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  intro_slider: ^3.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for full-screen presentations. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>UIRequiresPersistentWiFi</key>
<true/>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `intro_slider` in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:intro_slider/intro_slider.dart';
```

2. Create a new class that extends `StatefulWidget` and implement the `IntroSlider` widget.

3. Define your slides with images, titles, and descriptions.

4. Use the `onDonePress` callback to navigate to the main part of your app after the user completes the onboarding.

This will be demonstrated in the complete example section below.

# Complete Example of Using the `intro_slider` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:intro_slider/intro_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List to hold the slides
  List<Slide> slides = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the slides with images, titles, and descriptions
    slides.add(
      Slide(
        title: "Welcome to RealFlutter",
        description: "This is an amazing app that helps you learn Flutter.",
        pathImage: "assets/images/slide1.png",
        backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
      ),
    );
    slides.add(
      Slide(
        title: "Learn Flutter",
        description: "Explore various widgets and packages.",
        pathImage: "assets/images/slide2.png",
        backgroundColor: Colors.green,
      ),
    );
    slides.add(
      Slide(
        title: "Get Started",
        description: "Let's dive into the world of Flutter!",
        pathImage: "assets/images/slide3.png",
        backgroundColor: Colors.red,
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to navigate to the main app after onboarding
  void onDonePress() {
    // Navigate to the main application screen
    Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
      MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => MainAppScreen()),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: IntroSlider(
        slides: slides,
        onDonePress: onDonePress, // Callback for when done is pressed
        colorDoneBtn: Colors.blue,
        colorSkipBtn: Colors.grey,
        colorNextBtn: Colors.blue,
        // Customize the appearance of buttons
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Main application screen after onboarding
class MainAppScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Main App")),
      body: Center(child: Text("Welcome to the Main App!")),
    );
  }
}

/*
  Application Flow Explanation:
  1. The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
  2. In the `RealFlutter` state, we initialize a list of slides in the `initState` method.
  3. Each slide contains a title, description, and an image path, along with a background color.
  4. The `IntroSlider` widget is built in the `build` method, displaying the slides.
  5. When the user presses the "Done" button, the `onDonePress` method is called, navigating to the `MainAppScreen`.
  6. The `MainAppScreen` displays a simple welcome message, indicating that the user has completed the onboarding process.
