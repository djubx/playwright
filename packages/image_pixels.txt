# Overview of the `image_pixels` Flutter Package

The `image_pixels` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for easy manipulation and analysis of image pixel data. This package is particularly useful in applications that require image processing, such as photo editing apps, image analysis tools, or any application that needs to work with raw image data.

## When to Use `image_pixels`

You might consider using the `image_pixels` package in scenarios such as:
- **Image Editing**: When you need to apply filters or effects to images by manipulating pixel data.
- **Image Analysis**: For applications that require analyzing images for features, colors, or patterns.
- **Custom Image Rendering**: When you want to create custom image rendering logic based on pixel manipulation.

## Features

- **Pixel Access**: Direct access to pixel data for reading and writing.
- **Image Manipulation**: Functions to manipulate pixel data, such as changing colors, applying filters, and more.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Efficient algorithms for handling large images without significant performance hits.

With these features, the `image_pixels` package provides a robust solution for developers looking to integrate image processing capabilities into their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `image_pixels` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `image_pixels` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_pixels: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing images from the gallery or camera. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take pictures.</string>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to load an image, manipulate its pixels, and display the result.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_pixels/image_pixels.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Pixels Example',
      home: ImagePixelsExample(),
    );
  }
}

class ImagePixelsExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImagePixelsExampleState createState() => _ImagePixelsExampleState();
}

class _ImagePixelsExampleState extends State<ImagePixelsExample> {
  // Variable to hold the processed image
  Image? processedImage;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load and process the image when the widget is initialized
    _loadAndProcessImage();
  }

  Future<void> _loadAndProcessImage() async {
    // Load an image from assets
    final image = await loadImage('assets/sample_image.png');

    // Process the image pixels
    final pixels = await image.getPixels();

    // Manipulate pixels (e.g., invert colors)
    for (int i = 0; i < pixels.length; i++) {
      pixels[i] = 0xFFFFFFFF - pixels[i]; // Invert colors
    }

    // Create a new image from the manipulated pixels
    final newImage = await createImageFromPixels(pixels, image.width, image.height);

    // Update the state with the new image
    setState(() {
      processedImage = newImage;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Pixels Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: processedImage != null
            ? processedImage // Display the processed image
            : CircularProgressIndicator(), // Show loading indicator while processing
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. The `ImagePixelsExample` widget is a stateful widget that processes an image.
// 4. In the `initState` method, the `_loadAndProcessImage` function is called to load and manipulate the image.
// 5. The image is loaded from assets, and its pixels are accessed and manipulated (inverted in this case).
// 6. A new image is created from the manipulated pixels and set to the state.
// 7. The `build` method displays the processed image or a loading indicator while the image is being processed.
