# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `pip_view`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `pip_view` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pip_view: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a pip view.

# Complete Example of Using `pip_view`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pip_view/pip_view.dart'; // Import the pip_view package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pip View Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Pip View Example'),
        ),
        body: PipViewExample(), // Use the PipViewExample widget
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PipViewExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: PipView(
        // Create a PipView widget
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('This is a pip view!'), // Display a text in the pip view
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'), // Button to trigger action
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of the PipViewExample widget.
// 5. PipViewExample builds a PipView containing a Column with a Text widget and a Button.
// 6. When the button is pressed, a SnackBar is displayed at the bottom of the screen.
```
