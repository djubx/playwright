  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application and is presented with a spinning wheel.
// 2. The user can select a section on the wheel by tapping on it.
// 3. When a section is selected, the wheel rotates to the selected section.
// 4. The selected section is displayed below the wheel.
// 5. The user can repeat the process to select a different section.

// In summary, the code creates a spinning wheel with three sections, each representing a different option.
// The user can select a section by tapping on it, and the wheel rotates to the selected section.
// The selected section is displayed below the wheel.
