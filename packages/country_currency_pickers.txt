# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `country_currency_pickers` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `country_currency_pickers` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  country_currency_pickers: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file to ensure proper localization support:

```xml
<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
<array>
    <string>en</string>
    <string>es</string>
    <string>fr</string>
    <!-- Add other languages as needed -->
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the country and currency picker.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:country_currency_pickers/country_currency_pickers.dart';
```

2. Use the `CountryPicker` and `CurrencyPicker` widgets in your UI:

```dart
CountryPicker(
  onChanged: (Country country) {
    print("Selected country: ${country.name}");
  },
),
CurrencyPicker(
  onChanged: (Currency currency) {
    print("Selected currency: ${currency.name}");
  },
);
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `country_currency_pickers` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the `country_currency_pickers` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_currency_pickers/country_currency_pickers.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Country Currency Picker Example',
      home: CountryCurrencyPickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CountryCurrencyPickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountryCurrencyPickerScreenState createState() => _CountryCurrencyPickerScreenState();
}

class _CountryCurrencyPickerScreenState extends State<CountryCurrencyPickerScreen> {
  Country? selectedCountry; // Variable to hold the selected country
  Currency? selectedCurrency; // Variable to hold the selected currency

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Country and Currency Picker'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Country Picker
            CountryPicker(
              onChanged: (Country country) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedCountry = country; // Update the selected country
                });
              },
              selectedCountry: selectedCountry,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between the pickers
            // Currency Picker
            CurrencyPicker(
              onChanged: (Currency currency) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedCurrency = currency; // Update the selected currency
                });
              },
              selectedCurrency: selectedCurrency,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space for better UI
            // Display selected country and currency
            Text(
              selectedCountry != null
                  ? 'Selected Country: ${selectedCountry!.name}'
                  : 'No Country Selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
            Text(
              selectedCurrency != null
                  ? 'Selected Currency: ${selectedCurrency!.name}'
                  : 'No Currency Selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The CountryCurrencyPickerScreen is a stateful widget that maintains the selected country and currency.
// 4. The UI consists of two pickers: CountryPicker and CurrencyPicker.
// 5. When a user selects a country or currency, the onChanged callback updates the respective state variable.
// 6. The selected country and currency are displayed below the pickers, providing immediate feedback to the user.
