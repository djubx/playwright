# Tutorial: Setting Up the Country List Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `country_list` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  country_list: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/country_list).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for network requests if your app requires internet access for fetching country data.

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:country_list/country_list.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `CountryList` widget to display a list of countries. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it in your app:

```dart
CountryList(
  onChanged: (country) {
    print("Selected Country: ${country.name}");
  },
);
```

This widget will display a dropdown of countries, and when a user selects a country, it will print the selected country's name to the console.

With these steps, you are now ready to integrate the `country_list` package into your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the Country List Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_list/country_list.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Country List Example',
      home: CountrySelectionScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CountrySelectionScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CountrySelectionScreenState createState() => _CountrySelectionScreenState();
}

class _CountrySelectionScreenState extends State<CountrySelectionScreen> {
  String? selectedCountry; // Variable to hold the selected country

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Select Your Country'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected country or a prompt
            Text(
              selectedCountry != null
                  ? 'Selected Country: $selectedCountry'
                  : 'Please select a country',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Country list dropdown
            CountryList(
              onChanged: (country) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedCountry = country.name; // Update the selected country
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The home screen is CountrySelectionScreen, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. Inside CountrySelectionScreen, we maintain the state of the selected country.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 6. The Column displays either the selected country or a prompt to select one.
// 7. The CountryList widget is used to display a dropdown of countries.
// 8. When a country is selected, the onChanged callback updates the selectedCountry state, which triggers a rebuild to display the selected country.
```
