# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `obscure_widget`

## Installation
To add the `obscure_widget` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  obscure_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific privacy settings.

## Basic Usage
To use the `obscure_widget`, you can create a simple password input field. Hereâ€™s how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:obscure_widget/obscure_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Obscure Widget Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ObscureTextField(
            labelText: 'Password',
            obscureText: true, // Set to true to obscure the text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, `ObscureTextField` is a widget provided by the `obscure_widget` package that automatically handles text obscuring.

# Complete Example of Using `obscure_widget`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:obscure_widget/obscure_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Obscure Widget Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // ObscureTextField widget for password input
              ObscureTextField(
                labelText: 'Password',
                obscureText: true, // This will obscure the text input
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adds space between the fields
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action to perform on button press
                  // For example, validate the password
                },
                child: Text('Submit'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title 'Obscure Widget Example'.
// 4. The body contains a Padding widget to add space around the content.
// 5. A Column widget is used to arrange the ObscureTextField and ElevatedButton vertically.
// 6. The ObscureTextField is configured to obscure the text input, making it suitable for password entry.
// 7. An ElevatedButton is provided for submitting the password, with a placeholder for the action to be defined.
// 8. The layout is centered, providing a clean and user-friendly interface for password input.
