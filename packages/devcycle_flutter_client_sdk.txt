# Overview of the devcycle_flutter_client_sdk Package

The `devcycle_flutter_client_sdk` is a powerful Flutter package designed to facilitate feature flagging and remote configuration in mobile applications. This package allows developers to manage feature flags dynamically, enabling or disabling features without requiring a new app release. This is particularly useful for A/B testing, gradual rollouts, and managing different environments (e.g., staging vs. production).

## When to Use This Package
- **Feature Flagging**: Control the visibility of features for different user segments.
- **A/B Testing**: Test different versions of features to determine which performs better.
- **Remote Configuration**: Change app behavior and appearance without redeploying the app.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Feature Management**: Enable or disable features in real-time.
- **User Segmentation**: Target specific user groups with tailored features.
- **Remote Configuration**: Adjust app settings remotely based on user behavior or other criteria.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process with clear API for managing flags and configurations.

Overall, the `devcycle_flutter_client_sdk` package is an essential tool for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with dynamic feature management capabilities.

# Setting Up and Using devcycle_flutter_client_sdk

## Installation
To get started with the `devcycle_flutter_client_sdk`, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  devcycle_flutter_client_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/devcycle_flutter_client_sdk).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions and configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add any necessary configurations, such as permissions or settings required by the SDK.

## Basic Usage
To use the `devcycle_flutter_client_sdk`, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:devcycle_flutter_client_sdk/devcycle_flutter_client_sdk.dart';

void main() async {
  // Initialize the SDK with your client key
  await DevCycle.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_KEY');
  
  // Now you can use the SDK to manage feature flags
}
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_CLIENT_KEY` with your actual client key from the DevCycle dashboard.

## Example Usage
Once initialized, you can check feature flags and remote configurations as follows:

```dart
bool isFeatureEnabled = await DevCycle.isFeatureEnabled('feature_key');
```

This will return a boolean indicating whether the feature is enabled for the current user.

# Complete Example of Using devcycle_flutter_client_sdk

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:devcycle_flutter_client_sdk/devcycle_flutter_client_sdk.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure Flutter is initialized before running the app
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize the DevCycle SDK with your client key
  await DevCycle.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_KEY');
  
  // Run the Flutter app
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'DevCycle Example',
      home: FeatureHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class FeatureHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FeatureHomePageState createState() => _FeatureHomePageState();
}

class _FeatureHomePageState extends State<FeatureHomePage> {
  bool _isFeatureEnabled = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _checkFeatureFlag();
  }

  // Method to check if a feature is enabled
  Future<void> _checkFeatureFlag() async {
    // Check if the feature is enabled using its key
    bool isEnabled = await DevCycle.isFeatureEnabled('new_feature');
    
    // Update the state with the feature flag result
    setState(() {
      _isFeatureEnabled = isEnabled;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('DevCycle Feature Flag Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _isFeatureEnabled
            ? Text('New Feature is Enabled!')
            : Text('New Feature is Disabled.'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing the DevCycle SDK with a client key.
// 2. The main widget, MyApp, is created, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The FeatureHomePage widget is displayed as the home page.
// 4. In the FeatureHomePage, the _checkFeatureFlag method is called during initState.
// 5. This method checks if the feature with the key 'new_feature' is enabled.
// 6. The state is updated based on the result, and the UI reflects whether the feature is enabled or disabled.
```
