import 'package:flutter_document_reader_core_doctype/flutter_document_reader_core_doctype.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Document Reader Example')),
        body: DocumentViewer(
          filePath: 'path/to/your/document.pdf', // Specify the document path
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a document viewer that displays a PDF file. Make sure to replace `'path/to/your/document.pdf'` with the actual path to your document.

# Complete Example of flutter_document_reader_core_doctype

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_document_reader_core_doctype/flutter_document_reader_core_doctype.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Document Reader Example',
      home: DocumentHome(),
    );
  }
}

class DocumentHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Document Reader'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the document viewer when the button is pressed
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(
                builder: (context) => DocumentViewerScreen(),
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Open Document'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DocumentViewerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Viewing Document'),
      ),
      body: DocumentViewer(
        filePath: 'path/to/your/document.pdf', // Specify the document path
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. DocumentHome is displayed, which contains a button to open the document viewer.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it navigates to DocumentViewerScreen.
// 5. DocumentViewerScreen displays the document specified by the filePath.
// 6. The user can view the document within the app.
