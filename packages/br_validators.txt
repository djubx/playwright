# Overview of the br_validators Flutter Package

The `br_validators` package is a powerful and flexible validation library for Flutter applications. It provides a set of pre-defined validators that can be easily integrated into your forms, ensuring that user input meets specific criteria. This package is particularly useful when building applications that require robust data validation, such as registration forms, login screens, or any input fields where data integrity is crucial.

## When to Use `br_validators`
- **Form Validation**: When you need to validate user input in forms.
- **Data Integrity**: To ensure that the data collected from users meets certain standards.
- **User Experience**: To provide immediate feedback to users about their input.

## Key Features
- **Pre-defined Validators**: Includes common validators like email, password strength, and required fields.
- **Custom Validators**: Allows developers to create their own validation rules.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to use with Flutter's form widgets.
- **Comprehensive Error Messages**: Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs.

Overall, `br_validators` is an essential tool for any Flutter developer looking to enhance their application's data validation capabilities.

# Setting Up and Using br_validators

## Installation
To use the `br_validators` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  br_validators: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `br_validators` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional configurations required for either platform, making it easy to integrate into your existing Flutter applications.

## Basic Usage
To use the validators provided by the `br_validators` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:br_validators/br_validators.dart';
```

You can then use the validators in your form fields. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it in a Flutter form:

```dart
final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();

String? _email;
String? _password;

void _submit() {
  if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) {
    // Process data
  }
}
```

In your form fields, you can apply the validators like this:

```dart
TextFormField(
  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
  validator: EmailValidator(errorText: 'Enter a valid email'),
  onSaved: (value) => _email = value,
),
TextFormField(
  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Password'),
  validator: PasswordValidator(errorText: 'Password must be at least 6 characters'),
  onSaved: (value) => _password = value,
),
```

This setup will ensure that the email and password fields are validated according to the rules defined in the `br_validators` package.

# Complete Example of br_validators in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:br_validators/br_validators.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'br_validators Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Form Validation Example'),
        ),
        body: MyForm(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyFormState createState() => _MyFormState();
}

class _MyFormState extends State<MyForm> {
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>(); // Key to identify the form
  String? _email; // Variable to hold email input
  String? _password; // Variable to hold password input

  void _submit() {
    if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) { // Validate the form
      _formKey.currentState!.save(); // Save the form data
      // Process the data (e.g., send to server)
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Processing Data')),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0), // Padding around the form
      child: Form(
        key: _formKey, // Assign the form key
        child: Column(
          children: <Widget>[
            TextFormField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'), // Email field
              validator: EmailValidator(errorText: 'Enter a valid email'), // Email validation
              onSaved: (value) => _email = value, // Save email input
            ),
            TextFormField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Password'), // Password field
              validator: PasswordValidator(errorText: 'Password must be at least 6 characters'), // Password validation
              onSaved: (value) => _password = value, // Save password input
              obscureText: true, // Hide password input
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between fields and button
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _submit, // Submit button
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold containing an AppBar and MyForm.
// 3. MyForm is a StatefulWidget that manages the form state.
// 4. The form is created with a GlobalKey to manage its state and validate inputs.
// 5. Two TextFormFields are created for email and password, each with their respective validators from br_validators.
// 6. When the submit button is pressed, the _submit method is called.
// 7. The form is validated, and if valid, the data is saved and a SnackBar is shown indicating processing.
// 8. This flow ensures that user inputs are validated before any further processing.
