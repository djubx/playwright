In summary, the code flows as follows:

1. The user enters their CPF, CNPJ, CEI, credit card, and phone number in the respective fields.
2. When the user submits the form, the `validate` method is called on each field to check if the input is valid.
3. If any of the fields are invalid, an error message is displayed to the user.
4. If all fields are valid, the `save` method is called on each field to save the input values.
5. The saved values are then used to submit the form.
6. The form is submitted and the user is redirected to a success page.
