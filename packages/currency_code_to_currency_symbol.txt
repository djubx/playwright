import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:currency_code_to_currency_symbol/currency_code_to_currency_symbol.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {

      home: CurrencyConverterScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CurrencyConverterScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Example currency codes
    List<String> currencyCodes = ['USD', 'EUR', 'JPY', 'GBP'];

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Currency Code to Symbol'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: currencyCodes.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          // Convert currency code to symbol
          String code = currencyCodes[index];
          String symbol = CurrencyCodeToCurrencySymbol.convert(code);

          // Display the currency code and its symbol
          return ListTile(
            title: Text('Currency Code: $code'),
            subtitle: Text('Currency Symbol: $symbol'),
          );
        },

    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. CurrencyConverterScreen is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 4. A list of currency codes is defined.
// 5. A ListView.builder is used to create a scrollable list of currency codes and their symbols.
// 6. For each currency code, the convert method is called to get the corresponding symbol.
// 7. Each currency code and its symbol are displayed in a ListTile widget.
