# Setting Up the vietmap_flutter_navigation Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `vietmap_flutter_navigation` package, including platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `vietmap_flutter_navigation` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vietmap_flutter_navigation: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/vietmap_flutter_navigation).

## Step 2: Android Configuration

For Android, you need to ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

Additionally, ensure that you have the correct API keys and configurations set up for the mapping service you are using.

## Step 3: iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to modify the `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`. Add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide navigation services.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide navigation services.</string>
```

## Step 4: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, you need to initialize the `vietmap_flutter_navigation` package. This is typically done in the `main()` function of your application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vietmap_flutter_navigation/vietmap_flutter_navigation.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  VietMapNavigation.initialize(); // Initialize the navigation service
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

With these steps completed, you are now ready to use the `vietmap_flutter_navigation` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of vietmap_flutter_navigation

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `vietmap_flutter_navigation` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vietmap_flutter_navigation/vietmap_flutter_navigation.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  VietMapNavigation.initialize(); // Initialize the navigation service
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'VietMap Navigation Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: NavigationHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class NavigationHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NavigationHomePageState createState() => _NavigationHomePageState();
}

class _NavigationHomePageState extends State<NavigationHomePage> {
  // Variables to hold the start and end locations
  String startLocation = "Start Point";
  String endLocation = "End Point";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('VietMap Navigation'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Start Location: $startLocation'),
            Text('End Location: $endLocation'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startNavigation,
              child: Text('Start Navigation'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to start navigation
  void _startNavigation() {
    // Start navigation using the VietMapNavigation package
    VietMapNavigation.startNavigation(
      startLocation: startLocation,
      endLocation: endLocation,
      mode: NavigationMode.driving, // Set navigation mode
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing the VietMapNavigation service.
// 2. The RealFlutterApp widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The NavigationHomePage widget is displayed, showing the start and end locations.
// 4. When the user presses the "Start Navigation" button, the _startNavigation function is called.
// 5. This function triggers the navigation process using the VietMapNavigation package, providing the start and end locations along with the navigation mode.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we have created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates how to use the `vietmap_flutter_navigation` package. The application allows users to start navigation from a predefined start location to an end location. 

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application initializes the `vietmap_flutter_navigation` service.
- It displays a home page with the start and end locations.
- Upon pressing the "Start Navigation" button, the app invokes the navigation feature, providing the necessary parameters for routing.

This structure provides a comprehensive overview, setup guide, and practical example of using the `vietmap_flutter_navigation` package in a Flutter application.
