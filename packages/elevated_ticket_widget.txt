# Complete Example of Elevated Ticket Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:elevated_ticket_widget/elevated_ticket_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Elevated Ticket Widget Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: TicketHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class TicketHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Ticket Widget Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedTicketWidget(
          title: 'Concert Ticket',
          subtitle: 'Live at the Arena',
          date: '2024-09-30',
          price: '\$50',
          onTap: () {
            // Handle ticket tap
            print('Ticket tapped!');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to TicketHomePage.
// 4. TicketHomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedTicketWidget is created with properties like title, subtitle, date, and price.
// 6. The onTap property is defined to handle user interaction when the ticket is tapped, printing a message to the console.
