WarpedBloc Flutter Package
==========================

The WarpedBloc package is a state management solution for Flutter applications. It is designed to help developers manage the complexity of their app's state by providing a simple and efficient way to handle business logic and data flow.

When to Use WarpedBloc
--------------------

WarpedBloc is suitable for medium to large-scale applications with complex business logic. It is particularly useful when you need to manage multiple states, handle side effects, and optimize performance.

Features
--------

*   **Reactive State Management**: WarpedBloc uses a reactive approach to manage state, making it easy to handle changes and updates.
*   **Business Logic Separation**: WarpedBloc separates business logic from the UI, making it easier to test, maintain, and scale your app.
*   **Optimized Performance**: WarpedBloc is designed to optimize performance, reducing the number of unnecessary rebuilds and improving overall app efficiency.

Setting Up WarpedBloc
---------------------

To use WarpedBloc, you need to add the following dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  warped_bloc: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the dependencies.

Platform-Specific Configurations
--------------------------------

WarpedBloc works on both Android and iOS platforms without requiring any specific configurations.

Using WarpedBloc
----------------

To use WarpedBloc, you need to create a `Bloc` class that extends the `WarpedBloc` class. This class will handle the business logic and state management for your app.

Here is an example of a simple `Bloc` class:

```dart
class RealFlutterBloc extends WarpedBloc {
  RealFlutterBloc() : super(InitialState()) {
    on<LoadDataEvent>((event, emit) async {
      // Load data from API or database
      final data = await loadData();
      emit(LoadedState(data));
    });
  }
}
```

In this example, the `RealFlutterBloc` class extends the `WarpedBloc` class and overrides the `on` method to handle the `LoadDataEvent`. When the `LoadDataEvent` is triggered, the `on` method is called, and it loads the data from the API or database. Once the data is loaded, it emits the `LoadedState` with the loaded data.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:warped_bloc/warped_bloc.dart';

// Define the states
class InitialState extends WarpedState {}

class LoadedState extends WarpedState {
  final String data;

  LoadedState(this.data);
}

// Define the events
class LoadDataEvent extends WarpedEvent {}

class RealFlutterBloc extends WarpedBloc {
  RealFlutterBloc() : super(InitialState()) {
    // Handle the LoadDataEvent
    on<LoadDataEvent>((event, emit) async {
      // Load data from API or database
      final data = await loadData();
      emit(LoadedState(data));
    });
  }

  // Load data from API or database
  Future<String> loadData() async {
    // Simulate loading data
    await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 2));
    return 'Loaded data';
  }
}

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('WarpedBloc Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: BlocBuilder<RealFlutterBloc, WarpedState>(
            bloc: RealFlutterBloc(),
            builder: (context, state) {
              if (state is InitialState) {
                // If the state is InitialState, return a button to load data
                return ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Trigger the LoadDataEvent
                    context.read<RealFlutterBloc>().add(LoadDataEvent());
                  },
                  child: const Text('Load data'),
                );
              } else if (state is LoadedState) {
                // If the state is LoadedState, return the loaded data
                return Text(state.data);
              } else {
                // If the state is neither InitialState nor LoadedState, return an error message
                return const Text('Error');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The app starts, and the RealFlutterBloc is created with the InitialState.
// 2. The BlocBuilder is used to build the UI based on the current state.
// 3. If the state is InitialState, a button is displayed to load data.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the LoadDataEvent is triggered.
// 5. The RealFlutterBloc handles the LoadDataEvent and loads the data from the API or database.
// 6. Once the data is loaded, the RealFlutterBloc emits the LoadedState with the loaded data.
// 7. The BlocBuilder rebuilds the UI based on the new state.
// 8. If the state is LoadedState, the loaded data is displayed.
