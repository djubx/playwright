# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Focus Widget

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **focus_widget** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  focus_widget: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/focus_widget).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Focus Widget

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the **focus_widget** in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:focus_widget/focus_widget.dart';
```

2. Wrap your widgets with `FocusWidget` to manage their focus states.

```dart
FocusWidget(
  onFocusChange: (hasFocus) {
    // Handle focus change
    print('Focus changed: $hasFocus');
  },
  child: TextField(
    decoration: InputDecoration(
      labelText: 'Enter your name',
    ),
  ),
);
```

This setup allows you to manage focus changes effectively and respond to user interactions.

# Complete Example of Focus Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:focus_widget/focus_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Focus Widget Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Focus Widget Demo'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // FocusWidget to manage focus for the first TextField
              FocusWidget(
                onFocusChange: (hasFocus) {
                  // Print focus state to console
                  print('First TextField focus: $hasFocus');
                },
                child: TextField(
                  decoration: InputDecoration(
                    labelText: 'First Name',
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between fields
              // FocusWidget to manage focus for the second TextField
              FocusWidget(
                onFocusChange: (hasFocus) {
                  // Print focus state to console
                  print('Last TextField focus: $hasFocus');
                },
                child: TextField(
                  decoration: InputDecoration(
                    labelText: 'Last Name',
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Focus Widget Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Padding widget to provide space around the content.
// 5. A Column widget is used to arrange the TextFields vertically.
// 6. Each TextField is wrapped in a FocusWidget to manage its focus state.
// 7. The onFocusChange callback is used to print the focus state to the console whenever the focus changes.
// 8. The SizedBox widget adds space between the two TextFields for better UI layout.
