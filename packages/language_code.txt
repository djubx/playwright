# Language Code Flutter Package

The `language_code` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers manage and utilize language codes in their applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to handle language localization, making it easier to create multilingual applications. This package is particularly useful when you need to support multiple languages and want to ensure that your app can adapt to different locales seamlessly.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `language_code` package in scenarios such as:

- **Multilingual Applications**: If your app needs to support multiple languages, this package can help you manage language codes effectively.
- **Localization**: When you want to provide localized content based on the user's language preference.
- **Dynamic Language Switching**: If your app allows users to switch languages dynamically, this package simplifies the process.

## Features

- **Language Code Management**: Easily manage and retrieve language codes.
- **Locale Support**: Supports various locales, making it easy to adapt your app to different regions.
- **User-Friendly API**: The package provides a straightforward API that simplifies language code handling.

Overall, the `language_code` package is an essential tool for Flutter developers looking to create robust, multilingual applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Language Code Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `language_code` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `language_code` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  language_code: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the correct configurations. You may need to set the minimum SDK version to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable localization in your project settings. Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following entries for supported languages:

```xml
<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
<array>
    <string>en</string>
    <string>es</string>
    <string>fr</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to retrieve and display the current language code.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:language_code/language_code.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Retrieve the current language code
    String currentLanguageCode = LanguageCode.getCurrentLanguageCode();

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Language Code Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Current Language Code: $currentLanguageCode'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we import the `language_code` package and use it to get the current language code, which is then displayed in the app's UI.

# Complete Example of Using the Language Code Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:language_code/language_code.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Retrieve the current language code
    String currentLanguageCode = LanguageCode.getCurrentLanguageCode();

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Language Code Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Current Language Code: $currentLanguageCode'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function initializes the app and takes the RealFlutter widget as an argument.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 4. Inside the build method, we call LanguageCode.getCurrentLanguageCode() to get the current language code.
// 5. The MaterialApp widget is created, which provides the app structure.
// 6. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 7. The Center widget contains a Text widget that displays the current language code.
// 8. When the app runs, it shows the current language code in the center of the screen.
```
