Here's a detailed technical blog on the "sample_statistics" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Sample Statistics Flutter Package

The `sample_statistics` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed for developers who need to perform statistical analysis on sample data within their Flutter applications. This package provides a variety of statistical functions that can be easily integrated into any Flutter project, making it ideal for applications that require data analysis, such as educational apps, data visualization tools, or any app that needs to process and analyze numerical data.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `sample_statistics` package in scenarios such as:
- Analyzing user data to provide insights or recommendations.
- Performing statistical tests in educational applications.
- Visualizing data trends in business applications.

## Key Features

- **Mean, Median, Mode**: Calculate central tendency measures.
- **Standard Deviation and Variance**: Assess data dispersion.
- **Percentiles and Quartiles**: Understand data distribution.
- **Data Visualization**: Integrate with Flutter's UI to display statistical results.

The package is designed to be user-friendly, with a straightforward API that allows developers to focus on building their applications without getting bogged down in complex statistical calculations.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Sample Statistics Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `sample_statistics` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sample_statistics: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using it:

```dart
import 'package:sample_statistics/sample_statistics.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the various statistical functions provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a list of numbers:

```dart
void main() {
  List<double> data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

  // Calculate mean
  double mean = Statistics.mean(data);
  print('Mean: $mean');

  // Calculate standard deviation
  double stdDev = Statistics.standardDeviation(data);
  print('Standard Deviation: $stdDev');
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a dataset using the `sample_statistics` package.

# Complete Example of Using Sample Statistics

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sample_statistics/sample_statistics.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample Statistics Demo',
      home: StatisticsHome(),
    );
  }
}

class StatisticsHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _StatisticsHomeState createState() => _StatisticsHomeState();
}

class _StatisticsHomeState extends State<StatisticsHome> {
  List<double> data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
  double mean = 0.0;
  double stdDev = 0.0;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Calculate statistics when the widget is initialized
    calculateStatistics();
  }

  void calculateStatistics() {
    // Calculate mean and standard deviation
    mean = Statistics.mean(data);
    stdDev = Statistics.standardDeviation(data);
    // Update the UI
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Sample Statistics'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Data: $data'),
            Text('Mean: $mean'),
            Text('Standard Deviation: $stdDev'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. StatisticsHome is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the statistics calculations.
// 4. In the initState method, we call calculateStatistics to compute the mean and standard deviation of the data.
// 5. The calculateStatistics method uses the sample_statistics package to compute the mean and standard deviation.
// 6. The setState method is called to update the UI with the calculated values.
// 7. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the data, mean, and standard deviation in a column.
```
