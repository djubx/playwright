// This is the main entry point of the app.
// The MyApp widget is the root of the app.
// The MyHomePage widget is the home page of the app.
// The PermissionRequestPage widget is used to request permissions.
// The onGranted callback is called when all permissions are granted.
// The onDenied callback is called when any permission is denied.
// The app uses the Material Design theme.
// The app has a single button to request permissions.

// When the button is pressed, the PermissionRequestPage widget is pushed onto the navigator.
// The PermissionRequestPage widget requests the specified permissions.
// If all permissions are granted, the onGranted callback is called.
// If any permission is denied, the onDenied callback is called.

// This is a basic example of how to use the permission_request_page package.
// You can customize the PermissionRequestPage widget to fit your needs.
// You can also add more permissions to the permissions list.
