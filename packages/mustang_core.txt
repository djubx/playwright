# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `mustang_core`

## Installation

To get started with `mustang_core`, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mustang_core: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/mustang_core).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter and the `mustang_core` package. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using `mustang_core` in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a basic state management feature using the `RealFlutter` class.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mustang_core/mustang_core.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Mustang Core Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _data = "Initial Data";

  void _fetchData() {
    // Simulating a network call
    setState(() {
      _data = "Fetched Data from Mustang Core";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mustang Core Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(_data),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _fetchData,
              child: Text('Fetch Data'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that demonstrates how to use the `mustang_core` package for state management and networking.

# Complete Example of `mustang_core`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mustang_core/mustang_core.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Mustang Core Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _data = "Initial Data"; // Initial state of the data

  void _fetchData() {
    // Simulating a network call
    setState(() {
      _data = "Fetched Data from Mustang Core"; // Update state with fetched data
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mustang Core Example')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(_data), // Display the current state of data
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _fetchData, // Fetch data when button is pressed
              child: Text('Fetch Data'), // Button label
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 3. The HomeScreen maintains a state (_data) that is initially set to "Initial Data".
// 4. When the user presses the "Fetch Data" button, the _fetchData method is called.
// 5. The _fetchData method updates the state with new data, triggering a rebuild of the UI.
// 6. The updated data is displayed on the screen, demonstrating the state management capabilities of the mustang_core package.
