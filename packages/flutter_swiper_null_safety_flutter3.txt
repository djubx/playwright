# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_swiper_null_safety_flutter3

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_swiper_null_safety_flutter3` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_swiper_null_safety_flutter3: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_swiper_null_safety_flutter3/flutter_swiper.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

You can use the `Swiper` widget to create a swipeable interface. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
Swiper(
  itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
    return Image.network(
      'https://example.com/image$index.jpg',
      fit: BoxFit.fill,
    );
  },
  itemCount: 5,
  pagination: SwiperPagination(),
  control: SwiperControl(),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android
Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for internet access if you are loading images from the web:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

#### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Customization Options

The `Swiper` widget comes with various customization options, such as:
- **Pagination**: Control how pagination indicators are displayed.
- **Control**: Add navigation controls for swiping.
- **Autoplay**: Enable automatic swiping through items.

Example of a customized Swiper:

```dart
Swiper(
  itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
    return Image.network(
      'https://example.com/image$index.jpg',
      fit: BoxFit.fill,
    );
  },
  itemCount: 5,
  pagination: SwiperPagination(
    alignment: Alignment.bottomCenter,
    builder: DotSwiperPaginationBuilder(
      color: Colors.grey,
      activeColor: Colors.blue,
    ),
  ),
  control: SwiperControl(color: Colors.white),
  autoplay: true,
)
```

This setup provides a visually appealing and functional swipeable interface for your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_swiper_null_safety_flutter3

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_swiper_null_safety_flutter3/flutter_swiper.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Swiper Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Swiper Example'),
        ),
        body: Swiper(
          // The Swiper widget is used to create a swipeable interface
          itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
            // This function builds each item in the swiper
            return Image.network(
              'https://example.com/image$index.jpg', // Load images from the web
              fit: BoxFit.fill, // Fill the space of the container
            );
          },
          itemCount: 5, // Total number of items to display
          pagination: SwiperPagination(
            // Pagination indicators at the bottom
            alignment: Alignment.bottomCenter,
            builder: DotSwiperPaginationBuilder(
              color: Colors.grey, // Color of inactive dots
              activeColor: Colors.blue, // Color of active dot
            ),
          ),
          control: SwiperControl(color: Colors.white), // Navigation controls
          autoplay: true, // Enable automatic swiping
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Flutter Swiper Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a Swiper widget that displays a series of images.
// 5. The itemBuilder function constructs each image widget based on the index.
// 6. The Swiper has pagination indicators and navigation controls for user interaction.
// 7. The autoplay feature allows the swiper to automatically transition between images.
