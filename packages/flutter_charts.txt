## Part 2: Tutorial

<!-- START_TUTORIAL -->
# Setting Up flutter_charts

To get started with the `flutter_charts` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `flutter_charts` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_charts: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_charts).

### Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `flutter_charts` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_charts/flutter_charts.dart';
```

### Step 5: Basic Usage

You can now start using the `flutter_charts` package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a line chart:

```dart
LineChart(
  data: [
    ChartData(x: 'Jan', y: 30),
    ChartData(x: 'Feb', y: 50),
    ChartData(x: 'Mar', y: 20),
  ],
  title: 'Monthly Sales',
);
```

This code snippet creates a line chart displaying sales data for the first three months of the year.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of flutter_charts

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_charts/flutter_charts.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Charts Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Charts Example'),
        ),
        body: ChartScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ChartScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for the chart
    final data = [
      ChartData(x: 'Jan', y: 30),
      ChartData(x: 'Feb', y: 50),
      ChartData(x: 'Mar', y: 20),
      ChartData(x: 'Apr', y: 70),
      ChartData(x: 'May', y: 40),
    ];

    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          // Displaying a line chart
          Expanded(
            child: LineChart(
              data: data,
              title: 'Monthly Sales',
              xAxisLabel: 'Months',
              yAxisLabel: 'Sales',
              lineColor: Colors.blue,
              pointColor: Colors.red,
              showGrid: true,
            ),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          // Displaying a bar chart
          Expanded(
            child: BarChart(
              data: data,
              title: 'Monthly Sales (Bar Chart)',
              xAxisLabel: 'Months',
              yAxisLabel: 'Sales',
              barColor: Colors.green,
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body that displays the ChartScreen widget.
// 4. ChartScreen is another StatelessWidget that builds a column with two charts: a LineChart and a BarChart.
// 5. The LineChart displays monthly sales data with specified colors and labels.
// 6. The BarChart displays the same data in a bar format, allowing for easy comparison.
// 7. The charts are responsive and will adjust to the screen size, providing a user-friendly experience.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

### Summary of Application Flow

The application starts with the `main()` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget. This widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with a title and a `Scaffold` containing an `AppBar` and a body. The body consists of the `ChartScreen` widget, which displays two types of charts: a line chart and a bar chart, both visualizing monthly sales data. The charts are customizable and responsive, providing a clear and interactive way to present data to users.
