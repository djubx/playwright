# Exploring the "whois" Flutter Package

The "whois" Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to perform WHOIS lookups directly within their Flutter applications. WHOIS is a query and response protocol used for querying databases that store registered users or assignees of a domain name or an IP address. This package is particularly useful for applications that require domain information, such as domain registrars, web hosting services, or cybersecurity tools.

## When to Use the "whois" Package
- **Domain Registration Services**: To check the availability of a domain name.
- **Cybersecurity Applications**: To gather information about a domain for security assessments.
- **Web Hosting Services**: To provide users with information about their domains.

## Key Features
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for performing WHOIS lookups.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking calls for better performance.
- **Customizable Queries**: Ability to specify different types of WHOIS queries.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "whois" Package

## Installation
To use the "whois" package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  whois: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
To perform a WHOIS lookup, you can use the following code snippet in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:whois/whois.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('WHOIS Lookup')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Perform a WHOIS lookup for a domain
              String domain = 'example.com';
              var result = await Whois.lookup(domain);
              // Display the result
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('WHOIS Result for $domain'),
                  content: Text(result),
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                      child: Text('Close'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Lookup WHOIS'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application with a button that, when pressed, performs a WHOIS lookup for the specified domain and displays the result in a dialog.

# Complete Example of the "whois" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:whois/whois.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('WHOIS Lookup')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the domain to look up
              String domain = 'example.com';
              // Perform the WHOIS lookup asynchronously
              var result = await Whois.lookup(domain);
              // Show the result in a dialog
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  title: Text('WHOIS Result for $domain'),
                  content: Text(result), // Display the WHOIS result
                  actions: [
                    TextButton(
                      onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(), // Close the dialog
                      child: Text('Close'),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Lookup WHOIS'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the application
}
```

// The application starts by running the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple UI containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton that triggers a WHOIS lookup when pressed.
// The domain to be looked up is hardcoded as 'example.com'.
// When the button is pressed, the `Whois.lookup` method is called asynchronously to fetch the WHOIS information.
// Once the result is obtained, it is displayed in an AlertDialog, allowing the user to view the information.
// The dialog can be closed by pressing the 'Close' button, which dismisses the dialog.

In summary, the "whois" package provides a straightforward way to perform WHOIS lookups in Flutter applications. The example above demonstrates how to set up the package, perform a lookup, and display the results in a user-friendly manner. This package is ideal for applications that require domain information, making it a valuable addition to your Flutter toolkit.
