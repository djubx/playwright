# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Easy Count Timer

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the **easy_count_timer** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_count_timer: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:easy_count_timer/easy_count_timer.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
You can create a timer by instantiating the `CountTimer` class. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
CountTimer(
  duration: Duration(seconds: 60), // Set the duration for the timer
  onTick: (remaining) {
    print('Time remaining: $remaining seconds');
  },
  onComplete: () {
    print('Timer completed!');
  },
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow background execution if you want the timer to run while the app is in the background. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

## Step 4: Customizing the Timer
You can customize the timer by changing its properties, such as the duration, tick interval, and callbacks. Here’s an example of a customizable timer:

```dart
CountTimer(
  duration: Duration(minutes: 2),
  tickInterval: Duration(seconds: 1),
  onTick: (remaining) {
    // Update UI with remaining time
  },
  onComplete: () {
    // Notify user that the timer has completed
  },
);
```

With these steps, you can easily set up and use the easy_count_timer package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Easy Count Timer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_count_timer/easy_count_timer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Count Timer Example',
      home: TimerPage(),
    );
  }
}

class TimerPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TimerPageState createState() => _TimerPageState();
}

class _TimerPageState extends State<TimerPage> {
  // Timer duration set to 1 minute
  final Duration timerDuration = Duration(minutes: 1);
  late CountTimer countTimer;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the CountTimer
    countTimer = CountTimer(
      duration: timerDuration,
      onTick: (remaining) {
        // Update the UI with the remaining time
        setState(() {
          // This will trigger a rebuild to show the updated time
        });
      },
      onComplete: () {
        // Show a dialog when the timer completes
        showDialog(
          context: context,
          builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
            title: Text('Timer Completed!'),
            content: Text('The countdown has finished.'),
            actions: [
              TextButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                },
                child: Text('OK'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Easy Count Timer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the remaining time
            Text(
              'Time Remaining: ${countTimer.remaining.inSeconds} seconds',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Start the timer
                countTimer.start();
              },
              child: Text('Start Timer'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Stop the timer
                countTimer.stop();
              },
              child: Text('Stop Timer'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The TimerPage widget is displayed, which contains the timer functionality.
// 3. In the initState method, a CountTimer instance is created with a duration of 1 minute.
// 4. The onTick callback updates the UI with the remaining time every second.
// 5. When the timer completes, an AlertDialog is shown to notify the user.
// 6. The UI consists of a text widget displaying the remaining time and buttons to start and stop the timer.
// 7. Pressing the "Start Timer" button starts the countdown, while the "Stop Timer" button stops it.
