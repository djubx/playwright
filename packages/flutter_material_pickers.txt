# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_material_pickers

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_material_pickers` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_material_pickers: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a date picker and a color picker.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_material_pickers/flutter_material_pickers.dart';
```

2. Create a simple UI with buttons to trigger the pickers:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Material Pickers Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Trigger the date picker
                  showMaterialDatePicker(
                    context: context,
                    title: 'Select Date',
                    onChanged: (date) {
                      // Handle the selected date
                      print('Selected date: $date');
                    },
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Pick a Date'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Trigger the color picker
                  showMaterialColorPicker(
                    context: context,
                    title: 'Select Color',
                    onChanged: (color) {
                      // Handle the selected color
                      print('Selected color: $color');
                    },
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Pick a Color'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run your application to see the pickers in action!

                  // Trigger the color picker
                  showMaterialColorPicker(
                    context: context,
                    title: 'Select Color',
                    onChanged: (color) {
                      // Handle the selected color
                      print('Selected color: $color');
                    },
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Pick a Color'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a body.
// 3. In the body, a Center widget is used to center the content vertically and horizontally.
// 4. A Column widget arranges two buttons vertically.
// 5. The first button triggers a date picker when pressed, allowing the user to select a date.
// 6. The selected date is printed to the console.
// 7. The second button triggers a color picker, allowing the user to select a color.
// 8. The selected color is also printed to the console.
// 9. The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for selecting dates and colors.
