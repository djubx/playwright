// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user is presented with a series of steps, starting from Step 1.
// 2. The user can navigate through the steps using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
// 3. As the user navigates through the steps, the current step is updated and the corresponding content is displayed.
// 4. The user can complete the steps in any order, but the "Next" button will only be enabled if the current step is completed.
// 5. Once the user completes all the steps, they can review the steps and their corresponding content.

// The code flow is as follows:
// 1. The `RealFlutter` widget is created and initialized with a list of steps.
// 2. The `Steps` widget is used to display the steps and their corresponding content.
// 3. The `StepIndicator` widget is used to display the step indicators.
// 4. The `StepNavigation` widget is used to display the navigation buttons.
// 5. The `onPrevious` and `onNext` callbacks are used to update the current step and navigate through the steps.
