```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fan_carousel_image_slider/fan_carousel_image_slider.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {

      title: 'Fan Carousel Image Slider Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Fan Carousel Image Slider'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FanCarouselImageSlider(
            // List of image URLs to display in the slider
            images: [
              'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
              'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
              'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
            ],
            // Configuration options
            height: 300, // Height of the slider
            width: double.infinity, // Full width
            radius: 20, // Radius for the fan effect
            spacing: 10, // Spacing between images
            animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Animation duration
            // Optional: Add a callback for when an image is tapped
            onImageTap: (index) {
              print('Tapped on image $index');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),

// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, we use the FanCarouselImageSlider widget to display a list of images.
// 5. The slider is configured with height, width, radius, spacing, and animation duration.
// 6. An optional onImageTap callback is provided to handle image taps, printing the index of the tapped image.
