# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Learning Language Package

## Installation
To add the `learning_language` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  learning_language: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
2. Add any necessary permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` if your app requires internet access or other features.

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add any required permissions, such as for network access.
2. Ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0.

## Basic Usage
To use the `learning_language` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:learning_language/learning_language.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the main class, `RealFlutter`, and start utilizing its features.

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Language Learning App',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using the Learning Language Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:learning_language/learning_language.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Language Learning App',
      home: RealFlutter(), // Main class for the language learning app
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize a list to hold vocabulary words
  List<String> vocabulary = ['Hello', 'Goodbye', 'Please', 'Thank you'];
  int currentIndex = 0; // Track the current word index

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Language Learning'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Current Word: ${vocabulary[currentIndex]}', // Display current word
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _nextWord, // Move to the next word
              child: Text('Next Word'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _takeQuiz, // Start a quiz
              child: Text('Take Quiz'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _nextWord() {
    // Move to the next word in the vocabulary list
    setState(() {
      currentIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % vocabulary.length; // Loop back to start
    });
  }

  void _takeQuiz() {
    // Logic to start a quiz can be implemented here
    // For now, we will just show a simple dialog
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return AlertDialog(
          title: Text('Quiz'),
          content: Text('This is where the quiz will be implemented.'),
          actions: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
              child: Text('Close'),
            ),
          ],
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// `MyApp` sets up the MaterialApp and specifies `RealFlutter` as the home widget.
// In `RealFlutter`, we maintain a list of vocabulary words and track the current index.
// The UI displays the current word and provides buttons to navigate to the next word or take a quiz.
// The `_nextWord` method updates the current index to show the next word, looping back to the start.
// The `_takeQuiz` method currently shows a dialog, but this is where quiz logic can be implemented.
// Overall, this simple app demonstrates the basic functionality of the `learning_language` package.
