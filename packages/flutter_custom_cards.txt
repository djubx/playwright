# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_custom_cards

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_custom_cards` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_custom_cards: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a custom card using the `flutter_custom_cards` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_custom_cards/flutter_custom_cards.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom Cards Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomCard(
            title: 'Card Title',
            description: 'This is a description of the card.',
            imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
            onTap: () {
              // Handle card tap
              print('Card tapped!');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple application that displays a custom card with a title, description, and image. The `onTap` callback allows you to define what happens when the card is tapped.

# Complete Example of flutter_custom_cards

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_custom_cards/flutter_custom_cards.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom Cards Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomCard(
            title: 'Card Title', // Title of the card
            description: 'This is a description of the card.', // Description text
            imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg', // Image URL for the card
            onTap: () {
              // Handle card tap
              print('Card tapped!'); // Action on tap
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a CustomCard is created with a title, description, and image URL.
// 4. When the card is tapped, the onTap callback is triggered, printing 'Card tapped!' to the console.
// 5. This structure allows for easy customization and integration of cards into any Flutter application.
```
