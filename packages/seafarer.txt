# Setting Up Seafarer

To get started with the Seafarer package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the Seafarer package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  seafarer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

### Step 2: Configure for Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` is set up to handle deep links. Add the following intent filter inside the `<activity>` tag:

```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="your_scheme" android:host="your_host" />
</intent-filter>
```

Replace `your_scheme` and `your_host` with your desired values.

### Step 3: Configure for iOS

For iOS, you need to update your `Info.plist` file to support URL schemes. Add the following:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>your_scheme</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

Again, replace `your_scheme` with your desired scheme.

### Step 4: Initialize Seafarer

In your main Dart file, initialize Seafarer in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:seafarer/seafarer.dart';

void main() {
  Seafarer.init();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### Step 5: Define Routes

Define your routes using the Seafarer package. For example:

```dart
Seafarer.of(context).addRoute(
  '/home',
  (context) => HomeScreen(),
);
```

### Step 6: Handle Incoming Links

To handle incoming links, you can use the following code in your main widget:

```dart
Seafarer.of(context).handleIncomingLinks();
```

This will ensure that your app responds to deep links correctly.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the Seafarer package in your Flutter application effectively.

## Part 3: Complete Example

```markdown
<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example of Seafarer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:seafarer/seafarer.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Seafarer for deep linking and routing
  Seafarer.init();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Seafarer Example',
      navigatorKey: Seafarer.navigatorKey, // Set the navigator key for Seafarer
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the details screen using Seafarer
            Seafarer.of(context).navigateTo('/details');
          },
          child: Text('Go to Details'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DetailsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Details Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the Details Screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing Seafarer.
// 2. MyApp is the root widget, setting up the MaterialApp with a navigator key for Seafarer.
// 3. The HomeScreen is displayed first, with a button to navigate to the DetailsScreen.
// 4. When the button is pressed, Seafarer navigates to the '/details' route.
// 5. The DetailsScreen is displayed, showing a welcome message.
