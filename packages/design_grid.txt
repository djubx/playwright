# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "design_grid" Package

## Installation

To get started with the **design_grid** package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  design_grid: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package. After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage

Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a grid layout using the **design_grid** package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:design_grid/design_grid.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Design Grid Example')),
        body: DesignGrid(
          columns: 3, // Number of columns in the grid
          children: [
            Container(color: Colors.red, height: 100),
            Container(color: Colors.green, height: 100),
            Container(color: Colors.blue, height: 100),
            Container(color: Colors.yellow, height: 100),
            Container(color: Colors.orange, height: 100),
            Container(color: Colors.purple, height: 100),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple grid layout with three columns and six colored containers. You can customize the number of columns and the size of the items as needed.

# Complete Example of the "design_grid" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:design_grid/design_grid.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Design Grid Example')),
        body: DesignGrid(
          columns: 3, // Set the number of columns in the grid
          children: [
            // Each Container represents a grid item
            Container(color: Colors.red, height: 100), // First item
            Container(color: Colors.green, height: 100), // Second item
            Container(color: Colors.blue, height: 100), // Third item
            Container(color: Colors.yellow, height: 100), // Fourth item
            Container(color: Colors.orange, height: 100), // Fifth item
            Container(color: Colors.purple, height: 100), // Sixth item
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the app structure.
// 3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which includes an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body contains a DesignGrid widget, which is responsible for laying out the child widgets in a grid format.
// 5. The DesignGrid is configured to have 3 columns, and it contains six colored Container widgets as its children.
// 6. Each Container has a fixed height of 100, and they are displayed in a grid layout, filling the available space.
// 7. The app will display a grid of colored boxes, demonstrating the capabilities of the design_grid package.
