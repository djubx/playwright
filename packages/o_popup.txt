# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `o_popup`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `o_popup` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  o_popup: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for popups if you are using any specific permissions or features. However, for basic usage, no additional configuration is required.

## Step 3: Using `o_popup`

To use the `o_popup` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:o_popup/o_popup.dart';
```

### Basic Usage Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display a basic alert popup:

```dart
void showAlert(BuildContext context) {
  OPopup.show(
    context: context,
    title: 'Alert',
    content: 'This is an alert message.',
    onConfirm: () {
      // Action on confirm
      Navigator.of(context).pop();
    },
  );
}
```

You can call this function from a button's `onPressed` callback to display the alert.

## Conclusion

The `o_popup` package is a versatile tool for creating popups in Flutter applications. With its easy setup and customizable features, it can significantly improve user interaction and experience.

# Complete Example of Using `o_popup`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:o_popup/o_popup.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'o_popup Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('o_popup Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the alert popup when the button is pressed
            showAlert(context);
          },
          child: Text('Show Alert'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showAlert(BuildContext context) {
    // Displaying a simple alert popup using o_popup
    OPopup.show(
      context: context,
      title: 'Alert',
      content: 'This is an alert message.',
      onConfirm: () {
        // Action on confirm
        Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the popup
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a button that, when pressed, triggers the showAlert function.
// 4. The showAlert function uses OPopup to display an alert with a title and content.
// 5. When the user confirms the alert, the popup closes, returning to the HomeScreen.
```
