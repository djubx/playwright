# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `animated_folder`

## Installation
To get started with the `animated_folder` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  animated_folder: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `animated_folder` package works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms. You may need to configure the following:

### Android
- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.

### iOS
- Make sure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Basic Usage
To use the `animated_folder` package, you can wrap your content in the `AnimatedFolder` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_folder/animated_folder.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Folder Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedFolder(
          title: Text('Tap to Expand'),
          children: [
            ListTile(title: Text('Item 1')),
            ListTile(title: Text('Item 2')),
            ListTile(title: Text('Item 3')),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, tapping on the title will expand or collapse the list of items smoothly.

# Complete Example of `animated_folder`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_folder/animated_folder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Folder Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Folder Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // The AnimatedFolder widget is used here to create an expandable section
            AnimatedFolder(
              title: Text('Tap to Expand'),
              // The children of the folder that will be shown when expanded
              children: [
                ListTile(title: Text('Item 1')),
                ListTile(title: Text('Item 2')),
                ListTile(title: Text('Item 3')),
              ],
            ),
            // Another AnimatedFolder for demonstration
            AnimatedFolder(
              title: Text('Another Section'),
              children: [
                ListTile(title: Text('Item A')),
                ListTile(title: Text('Item B')),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to stack multiple AnimatedFolder widgets.
// 5. Each AnimatedFolder has a title and a list of children (ListTile widgets).
// 6. Tapping on the title of an AnimatedFolder expands or collapses the list of items smoothly.
// 7. This structure allows for easy addition of more sections, enhancing the UI interactivity.
