# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wtf_sliding_sheet/wtf_sliding_sheet.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sliding Sheet Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Sliding Sheet Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show the sliding sheet when the button is pressed
              showSlidingSheet(context);
            },
            child: Text('Open Sliding Sheet'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showSlidingSheet(BuildContext context) {
    // Show the sliding sheet using the SlidingSheet widget
    showModalBottomSheet(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return SlidingSheet(
          elevation: 8,
          cornerRadius: 16,
          builder: (context, controller, offset) {
            // Content of the sliding sheet
            return Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
              color: Colors.white,
              child: Column(
                mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
                children: [
                  Text(
                    'This is a Sliding Sheet',
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                  ),
                  SizedBox(height: 16),
                  Text(
                    'You can add any widget here!',
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
                  ),
                  SizedBox(height: 16),
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      // Close the sliding sheet
                      Navigator.of(context).pop();
                    },
                    child: Text('Close'),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            );
          },
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Sliding Sheet Demo'.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the showSlidingSheet function is called.
// 6. The showSlidingSheet function uses showModalBottomSheet to display the SlidingSheet.
// 7. The SlidingSheet contains a title, a message, and a button to close the sheet.
// 8. Pressing the close button pops the sliding sheet off the stack, returning to the main screen.
