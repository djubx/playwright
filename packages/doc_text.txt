# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `doc_text` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `doc_text` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  doc_text: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21  // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app accesses files or the internet. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select documents.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to scan documents.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `doc_text` package in your app.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:doc_text/doc_text.dart'; // Import the doc_text package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Doc Text Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DocumentViewer(), // Set the home to DocumentViewer
    );
  }
}

class DocumentViewer extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DocumentViewerState createState() => _DocumentViewerState();
}

class _DocumentViewerState extends State<DocumentViewer> {
  String documentContent = "This is a sample document content."; // Sample document content

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Document Viewer'), // AppBar title
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            Expanded(
              child: DocText(
                text: documentContent, // Display the document content
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16), // Set text style
              ),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action to edit the document
                setState(() {
                  documentContent = "Document content has been edited."; // Update document content
                });
              },
              child: Text('Edit Document'), // Button to edit document
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home widget is DocumentViewer, which displays the document content.
// 4. The DocumentViewer has a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a DocText widget that displays the document content.
// 6. An ElevatedButton allows users to edit the document content.
// 7. When the button is pressed, the document content is updated, and the UI reflects the changes.
```
