# Document Scanner Flutter Package: Overview

The `document_scanner_flutter` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate document scanning capabilities into their mobile applications. This package leverages the device's camera to capture images of documents, automatically detecting edges and enhancing the scanned image for clarity and readability. 

## When to Use

This package is ideal for applications that require document digitization, such as:
- Mobile banking apps for check deposits.
- Educational apps for scanning notes or assignments.
- Business apps for scanning receipts or invoices.

## Features

- **Edge Detection**: Automatically detects the edges of a document in the camera view.
- **Image Enhancement**: Improves the quality of the scanned document for better readability.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Customizable UI**: Allows developers to customize the scanning interface to match the app's design.

# Setting Up the Document Scanner Flutter Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `document_scanner_flutter` package in a Flutter project. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Installation

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  document_scanner_flutter: ^0.0.1
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Update your `AndroidManifest.xml` to include camera permissions.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`.

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

## iOS Configuration

1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request camera access.

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to scan documents.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save scanned documents.</string>
```

2. **Podfile**: Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0.

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package

To use the `document_scanner_flutter` package, import it into your Dart file:

import 'package:document_scanner_flutter/document_scanner_flutter.dart';
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:document_scanner_flutter/document_scanner_flutter.dart';

void main() => runApp(RealFlutterApp());

class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Document Scanner Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DocumentScannerHome(),
    );
  }
}

class DocumentScannerHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DocumentScannerHomeState createState() => _DocumentScannerHomeState();
}

class _DocumentScannerHomeState extends State<DocumentScannerHome> {
  String _scannedDocumentPath;

  // Function to initiate document scanning
  Future<void> _scanDocument() async {
    try {
      // Launch the document scanner
      final scannedDocument = await DocumentScannerFlutter.launch(context);
      if (scannedDocument != null) {
        // Update the state with the scanned document path
        setState(() {
          _scannedDocumentPath = scannedDocument;
        });
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during scanning
      print('Error scanning document: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Document Scanner'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the scanned document if available
            _scannedDocumentPath != null
                ? Image.file(File(_scannedDocumentPath))
                : Text('No document scanned yet.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to start scanning
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _scanDocument,
              child: Text('Scan Document'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app starts with the `RealFlutterApp` widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The `DocumentScannerHome` widget is the main screen, displaying a button to scan documents.
// 3. When the "Scan Document" button is pressed, `_scanDocument` is called.
// 4. `_scanDocument` uses `DocumentScannerFlutter.launch` to open the scanner interface.
// 5. If a document is successfully scanned, its path is stored in `_scannedDocumentPath`.
// 6. The scanned document is displayed using an `Image.file` widget if available.
// 7. Errors during scanning are caught and printed to the console.
