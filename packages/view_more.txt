// The app starts by running the `main` function, which creates a `MaterialApp` with a `RealFlutter` widget as its home screen.
// The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that creates a `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a `Column` of children.
// The first child is a `ViewMore` widget with a short text, which is displayed in its entirety.
// The second child is a `ViewMore` widget with a long text, which is truncated to 100 characters and can be expanded by tapping on it.
// When the user taps on the truncated text, the `ViewMore` widget expands to show the full text.
