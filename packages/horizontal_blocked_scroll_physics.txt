# Overview of the `horizontal_blocked_scroll_physics` Flutter Package

The `horizontal_blocked_scroll_physics` package is a specialized Flutter package designed to enhance the scrolling behavior of horizontal lists or pages. It provides a custom scroll physics class that can be used to block or control the horizontal scroll interactions in a Flutter application. This package is particularly useful when you want to restrict or customize the horizontal scrolling behavior in your app, such as in scenarios where you need to prevent accidental swipes or control the scroll speed.

## When to Use

- **Prevent Accidental Swipes**: In applications where horizontal swipes might interfere with user interactions, such as in forms or games.
- **Controlled Scrolling**: When you need to implement a custom scrolling experience, like snapping to specific items or pages.
- **Performance Optimization**: By controlling the scroll physics, you can potentially improve the performance of your app by reducing unnecessary scroll events.

## Features

- **Customizable Scroll Physics**: Allows developers to define how the horizontal scroll should behave.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be easily integrated into existing Flutter applications with minimal configuration.
- **Platform Agnostic**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `horizontal_blocked_scroll_physics`

In this section, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `horizontal_blocked_scroll_physics` package in a Flutter application.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     horizontal_blocked_scroll_physics: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.

3. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package.
   ```dart
   import 'package:horizontal_blocked_scroll_physics/horizontal_blocked_scroll_physics.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android
- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support all features of Flutter.

### iOS
- Make sure your `Podfile` is using platform version 9.0 or higher.

## Using the Package

To use the `horizontal_blocked_scroll_physics`, you need to apply it to a scrollable widget, such as `ListView` or `PageView`.

```dart
ListView(
  scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
  physics: RealFlutter(),
  children: <Widget>[
    // Your list items here
  ],
)
```

In this example, `RealFlutter` is the main class provided by the package that controls the horizontal scroll physics.

# Complete Example: Flutter Application Using `horizontal_blocked_scroll_physics`

Below is a complete Flutter application demonstrating the use of the `horizontal_blocked_scroll_physics` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:horizontal_blocked_scroll_physics/horizontal_blocked_scroll_physics.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Horizontal Blocked Scroll Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Horizontal Blocked Scroll'),
        ),
        body: HorizontalScrollExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HorizontalScrollExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView(
      scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
      physics: RealFlutter(), // Apply custom scroll physics
      children: <Widget>[
        Container(
          width: 200.0,
          color: Colors.red,
          child: Center(child: Text('Item 1')),
        ),
        Container(
          width: 200.0,
          color: Colors.green,
          child: Center(child: Text('Item 2')),
        ),
        Container(
          width: 200.0,
          color: Colors.blue,
          child: Center(child: Text('Item 3')),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by calling `runApp` with `MyApp`.
// 2. `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the `MaterialApp` with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The home screen is a `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a `HorizontalScrollExample` as the body.
// 4. `HorizontalScrollExample` is a stateless widget that builds a horizontal `ListView`.
// 5. The `ListView` uses `RealFlutter` as its physics, which is the custom scroll physics provided by the package.
// 6. The list contains three containers with different colors and text, demonstrating the horizontal scroll behavior.
