# Tutorial: Setting Up Better Player

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **better_player** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **better_player** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  better_player: ^0.0.75 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure you have the correct deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple video player using **better_player**.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:better_player/better_player.dart';
   ```

2. Create a `BetterPlayerController` and use it in your widget:

   ```dart
   BetterPlayerController _betterPlayerController;

   @override
   void initState() {
       super.initState();
       _betterPlayerController = BetterPlayerController(
           BetterPlayerConfiguration(
               aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
               autoPlay: true,
               looping: true,
           ),
       );
   }

   @override
   void dispose() {
       _betterPlayerController.dispose();
       super.dispose();
   }
   ```

3. Use the `BetterPlayer` widget in your build method:

   ```dart
   @override
   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
           appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Better Player Example")),
           body: Center(
               child: BetterPlayer(
                   controller: _betterPlayerController,
               ),
           ),
       );
   }
   ```

With these steps, you have successfully set up the **better_player** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Better Player

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:better_player/better_player.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Better Player Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: VideoPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoPlayerScreenState createState() => _VideoPlayerScreenState();
}

class _VideoPlayerScreenState extends State<VideoPlayerScreen> {
  BetterPlayerController _betterPlayerController;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the BetterPlayerController with a video source
    BetterPlayerDataSource dataSource = BetterPlayerDataSource(
      BetterPlayerDataSourceType.network,
      'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // Replace with your video URL
    );

    _betterPlayerController = BetterPlayerController(
      BetterPlayerConfiguration(
        aspectRatio: 16 / 9, // Set the aspect ratio for the video
        autoPlay: true, // Automatically play the video
        looping: true, // Loop the video
      ),
    );

    // Load the video data source into the controller
    _betterPlayerController.setupDataSource(dataSource);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _betterPlayerController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Better Player Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: BetterPlayer(
          controller: _betterPlayerController, // Use the controller in the widget
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to VideoPlayerScreen.
// 4. In VideoPlayerScreen, the BetterPlayerController is initialized in initState.
// 5. A video source is set up using BetterPlayerDataSource.
// 6. The video is automatically played and looped.
// 7. The BetterPlayer widget is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 8. When the widget is disposed, the controller is also disposed to free resources.
```
