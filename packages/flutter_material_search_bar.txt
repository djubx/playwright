# Flutter Material Search Bar Package

The `flutter_material_search_bar` package is a powerful and customizable search bar widget for Flutter applications. It provides a sleek and modern interface that allows users to search through lists or collections of data seamlessly. This package is particularly useful in applications that require a search functionality, such as e-commerce apps, content libraries, or any app with a large dataset.

## When to Use This Package
- When you need a search bar that integrates well with Material Design.
- If you want to enhance user experience by providing a smooth and responsive search interface.
- When you need to filter or search through lists of items dynamically.

## Key Features
- **Customizable UI**: The search bar can be styled to fit the theme of your application.
- **Debounce Search**: It supports debouncing, which helps in reducing the number of search queries sent while the user is typing.
- **Flexible Search Logic**: You can implement custom search logic to filter data based on your requirements.
- **Integration with Lists**: Easily integrates with Flutter's ListView or GridView to display search results.

# Complete Example of flutter_material_search_bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_material_search_bar/flutter_material_search_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List of items to search through
  List<String> items = [
    "Apple",
    "Banana",
    "Cherry",
    "Date",
    "Elderberry",
    "Fig",
    "Grape",
    "Honeydew"
  ];

  // List to hold search results
  List<String> filteredItems = [];

  // Search bar controller
  late SearchBar searchBar;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the search bar
    searchBar = SearchBar(
      inBar: true,
      onChanged: (value) {
        // Update the filtered items based on the search query
        setState(() {
          filteredItems = items
              .where((item) => item.toLowerCase().contains(value.toLowerCase()))
              .toList();
        });
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text("Flutter Material Search Bar Example"),
          actions: [
            // Add the search bar to the app bar
            searchBar.getSearchAction(context),
          ],
        ),
        body: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: filteredItems.isEmpty ? items.length : filteredItems.length,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            // Display the filtered items or the original list
            String item = filteredItems.isEmpty ? items[index] : filteredItems[index];
            return ListTile(
              title: Text(item),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application with a search bar.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` class is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the search results.
// 3. In `initState`, we initialize the `SearchBar` and define the `onChanged` callback to filter items based on user input.
// 4. The `build` method constructs the UI, including an AppBar with the search bar and a ListView to display items.
// 5. The ListView displays either the original list of items or the filtered results based on the search query.
// 6. The search bar updates the displayed items dynamically as the user types, providing a smooth search experience.
