# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using linkfy_text

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `linkfy_text` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  linkfy_text: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use `linkfy_text` to display a text with clickable links.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:linkfy_text/linkfy_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Linkfy Text Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: LinkfyText(
            'Check out https://flutter.dev and email us at info@example.com!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            linkStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            onTap: (link) {
              // Handle link tap
              print('Tapped on link: $link');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a text with clickable links. The `LinkfyText` widget automatically detects the URL and email address, making them interactive.

# Complete Example of linkfy_text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:linkfy_text/linkfy_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Linkfy Text Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: LinkfyText(
            'Check out https://flutter.dev and email us at info@example.com!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Set the base text style
            linkStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold), // Customize link style
            onTap: (link) {
              // Handle link tap
              print('Tapped on link: $link'); // Log the tapped link
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. The LinkfyText widget is used to display text with clickable links.
// 7. The style property sets the font size of the text.
// 8. The linkStyle property customizes the appearance of the detected links.
// 9. The onTap callback is triggered when a link is tapped, logging the link to the console.
