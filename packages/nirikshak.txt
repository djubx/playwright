# Nirikshak Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Nirikshak package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  nirikshak: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the Nirikshak package, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nirikshak/nirikshak.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Nirikshak with your application ID
  Nirikshak.initialize(appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID');
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Nirikshak Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Nirikshak Demo')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Log a custom event
            Nirikshak.logEvent('Button Pressed', {'button': 'Demo Button'});
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize Nirikshak with an application ID and log a custom event when a button is pressed. This is a simple demonstration of how to integrate the package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Nirikshak in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nirikshak/nirikshak.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Nirikshak with your application ID
  Nirikshak.initialize(appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID');
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Nirikshak Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Nirikshak Demo')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Log a custom event when the button is pressed
                Nirikshak.logEvent('Button Pressed', {'button': 'Demo Button'});
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Simulate an error for demonstration
                try {
                  throw Exception('Simulated Error');
                } catch (e, stackTrace) {
                  // Log the error with stack trace
                  Nirikshak.logError(e.toString(), stackTrace);
                }
              },
              child: Text('Simulate Error'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Nirikshak package with an application ID.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains two buttons:
//    - The first button logs a custom event when pressed.
//    - The second button simulates an error and logs it using Nirikshak's error logging feature.
// 4. When the user interacts with the buttons, the respective events or errors are logged for monitoring and debugging purposes.
