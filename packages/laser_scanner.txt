# Overview of the laser_scanner Flutter Package

The `laser_scanner` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate laser scanning capabilities into their applications. This package allows you to access and utilize laser scanning hardware, enabling functionalities such as distance measurement, object detection, and more. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the `laser_scanner` package in scenarios such as:
- Building applications for construction or architecture that require precise distance measurements.
- Developing augmented reality (AR) applications that need to detect and measure real-world objects.
- Creating inventory management systems that utilize laser scanning for quick item identification.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Scanning**: Access live data from laser scanning devices.
- **Distance Measurement**: Measure distances accurately with minimal latency.
- **Object Detection**: Identify and interact with objects in the scanning range.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

The `laser_scanner` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their applications with advanced scanning capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the laser_scanner Package

## Installation
To get started with the `laser_scanner` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  laser_scanner: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions to enable Bluetooth and location services, which are often required for laser scanning devices:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for Bluetooth and location services:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to laser scanning devices.</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires location access to function properly with laser scanning.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `laser_scanner` package, you can create a simple Flutter application that initializes the scanner and displays the scanned data.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:laser_scanner/laser_scanner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Laser Scanner Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _scanResult = "No data";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeScanner();
  }

  void _initializeScanner() async {
    // Initialize the laser scanner
    await LaserScanner.initialize();
    // Start scanning
    LaserScanner.startScan((result) {
      setState(() {
        _scanResult = result.toString();
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop scanning when the widget is disposed
    LaserScanner.stopScan();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Laser Scanner'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Scan Result: $_scanResult',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using the laser_scanner Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:laser_scanner/laser_scanner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Laser Scanner Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _scanResult = "No data"; // Variable to hold the scan result

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeScanner(); // Initialize the scanner when the widget is created
  }

  void _initializeScanner() async {
    // Initialize the laser scanner
    await LaserScanner.initialize();
    // Start scanning and listen for results
    LaserScanner.startScan((result) {
      setState(() {
        _scanResult = result.toString(); // Update the scan result
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop scanning when the widget is disposed
    LaserScanner.stopScan();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Laser Scanner'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Scan Result: $_scanResult', // Display the scan result
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with the title 'Laser Scanner Demo' and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the scanning process.
// 4. In the _RealFlutterState class, the _scanResult variable is initialized to hold the result of the scan.
// 5. The _initializeScanner method is called in initState to set up the laser scanner and start scanning.
// 6. When a scan result is received, the state is updated to reflect the new result.
// 7. The dispose method ensures that scanning stops when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
// 8. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget displaying the scan result.
