# flutter_otp_text_field Package Overview

The `flutter_otp_text_field` package is a Flutter widget designed to facilitate the input of one-time passwords (OTPs) in a user-friendly manner. This package is particularly useful in applications that require user authentication via OTPs, such as banking apps, social media platforms, and any service that implements two-factor authentication (2FA).

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `flutter_otp_text_field` package when:
- Your application requires OTP verification for user authentication.
- You want to enhance user experience by providing a clean and intuitive interface for OTP input.
- You need to handle OTP input across multiple fields, allowing users to enter their codes easily.

## Features

- **Customizable UI**: The package allows for extensive customization of the OTP input fields, including colors, borders, and text styles.
- **Automatic Focus Management**: It automatically focuses on the next input field as the user types, improving the user experience.
- **Validation**: Built-in validation to ensure that the input is numeric and adheres to the expected length.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_otp_text_field

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_otp_text_field` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_otp_text_field` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_otp_text_field: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable the appropriate permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires network access for OTP verification. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple OTP input screen using `flutter_otp_text_field`. Below is a basic implementation.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_otp_text_field/flutter_otp_text_field.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'OTP Input Example',
      home: OTPInputScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class OTPInputScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _OTPInputScreenState createState() => _OTPInputScreenState();
}

class _OTPInputScreenState extends State<OTPInputScreen> {
  // This variable will hold the OTP entered by the user
  String otp = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Enter OTP'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // OTP Text Field
            OtpTextField(
              numberOfFields: 4, // Number of OTP fields
              borderColor: Colors.blue,
              showFieldAsBox: true,
              onCodeChanged: (String code) {
                // Handle the code change
                setState(() {
                  otp = code; // Update the OTP variable
                });
              },
              onSubmit: (String verificationCode) {
                // Handle the OTP submission
                print("Entered OTP: $verificationCode");
                // Here you can add your verification logic
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Trigger OTP submission
                print("Submitted OTP: $otp");
              },
              child: Text('Submit OTP'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code creates a simple Flutter application for OTP input.
// The main function initializes the app and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and an OTPInputScreen as the home screen.

// The OTPInputScreen is a stateful widget that manages the OTP input.
// It contains an OtpTextField widget that allows users to enter a 4-digit OTP.
// The onCodeChanged callback updates the otp variable whenever the user types in the fields.
// The onSubmit callback is triggered when the user finishes entering the OTP, allowing for further verification logic.

// An ElevatedButton is provided to submit the OTP, which currently prints the entered OTP to the console.
// This is where you would typically add your logic to verify the OTP with your backend service.
```

// In summary, the application flow begins with the user launching the app, which displays the OTP input screen. 
// The user enters their OTP in the provided fields, and the app captures the input in real-time. 
// Upon submission, the entered OTP is printed to the console, where you can implement your verification logic. 
// This simple structure allows for easy integration of OTP functionality into any Flutter application.
