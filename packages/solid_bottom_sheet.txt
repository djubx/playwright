# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Solid Bottom Sheet

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **solid_bottom_sheet** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  solid_bottom_sheet: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Then, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a solid bottom sheet.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:solid_bottom_sheet/solid_bottom_sheet.dart';
```

2. Create a `SolidBottomSheet` widget in your main widget tree. You can customize it as needed.

3. Use the `show` method to display the bottom sheet when a button is pressed.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation:

```dart
// Inside your main widget
SolidBottomSheet(
  headerBar: Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
    height: 50,
    child: Center(child: Text('Header')),
  ),
  body: Center(child: Text('This is the body of the bottom sheet')),
);
```

With this setup, you can now display a solid bottom sheet in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Solid Bottom Sheet

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:solid_bottom_sheet/solid_bottom_sheet.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Solid Bottom Sheet Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create a SolidBottomSheetController to manage the bottom sheet
  final SolidBottomSheetController _controller = SolidBottomSheetController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Solid Bottom Sheet Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the bottom sheet when the button is pressed
            _controller.show();
          },
          child: Text('Show Bottom Sheet'),
        ),
      ),
      // Define the SolidBottomSheet widget
      bottomSheet: SolidBottomSheet(
        controller: _controller,
        headerBar: Container(
          color: Colors.blue,
          height: 50,
          child: Center(child: Text('Header')),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
            children: [
              Text('This is the body of the bottom sheet'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Dismiss the bottom sheet when this button is pressed
                  _controller.hide();
                },
                child: Text('Close Bottom Sheet'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains a button that, when pressed, shows the bottom sheet.
// 4. The SolidBottomSheet widget is defined in the bottomSheet property of the Scaffold.
// 5. The bottom sheet has a header and a body, which contains a text and a button to close the sheet.
// 6. Pressing the "Close Bottom Sheet" button hides the bottom sheet.
