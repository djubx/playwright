# Tutorial: Setting Up the Country State City Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **country_state_city** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  country_state_city: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` to allow location services if your app requires it. Add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:country_state_city/country_state_city.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package
You can now use the package to fetch countries, states, and cities. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it in your Flutter app:

```dart
// Fetching countries
List<Country> countries = await CountryStateCity.getCountries();
```

This will give you a list of countries that you can use in your application.

# Complete Example of Using the Country State City Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_state_city/country_state_city.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Country State City Example',
      home: LocationPicker(),
    );
  }
}

class LocationPicker extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LocationPickerState createState() => _LocationPickerState();
}

class _LocationPickerState extends State<LocationPicker> {
  List<Country> countries = [];
  List<State> states = [];
  List<City> cities = [];
  Country? selectedCountry;
  State? selectedState;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch the list of countries when the widget is initialized
    fetchCountries();
  }

  // Function to fetch countries
  void fetchCountries() async {
    countries = await CountryStateCity.getCountries();
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI after fetching countries
  }

  // Function to fetch states based on selected country
  void fetchStates(String countryCode) async {
    states = await CountryStateCity.getStates(countryCode);
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI after fetching states
  }

  // Function to fetch cities based on selected state
  void fetchCities(String stateCode) async {
    cities = await CountryStateCity.getCities(selectedCountry!.code, stateCode);
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI after fetching cities
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Select Location')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            DropdownButton<Country>(
              hint: Text('Select Country'),
              value: selectedCountry,
              onChanged: (Country? newValue) {
                setState(() {
                  selectedCountry = newValue;
                  selectedState = null; // Reset state when country changes
                  states.clear(); // Clear states when country changes
                  cities.clear(); // Clear cities when country changes
                });
                if (newValue != null) {
                  fetchStates(newValue.code); // Fetch states for selected country
                }
              },
              items: countries.map((Country country) {
                return DropdownMenuItem<Country>(
                  value: country,
                  child: Text(country.name),
                );
              }).toList(),
            ),
            if (states.isNotEmpty) // Show states dropdown if available
              DropdownButton<State>(
                hint: Text('Select State'),
                value: selectedState,
                onChanged: (State? newValue) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedState = newValue;
                    cities.clear(); // Clear cities when state changes
                  });
                  if (newValue != null) {
                    fetchCities(newValue.code); // Fetch cities for selected state
                  }
                },
                items: states.map((State state) {
                  return DropdownMenuItem<State>(
                    value: state,
                    child: Text(state.name),
                  );
                }).toList(),
              ),
            if (cities.isNotEmpty) // Show cities dropdown if available
              DropdownButton<City>(
                hint: Text('Select City'),
                onChanged: (City? newValue) {
                  // Handle city selection
                },
                items: cities.map((City city) {
                  return DropdownMenuItem<City>(
                    value: city,
                    child: Text(city.name),
                  );
                }).toList(),
              ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The LocationPicker widget is displayed, which contains dropdowns for countries, states, and cities.
// 3. On initialization, the app fetches the list of countries and populates the first dropdown.
// 4. When a country is selected, the states for that country are fetched and displayed in the second dropdown.
// 5. When a state is selected, the cities for that state are fetched and displayed in the third dropdown.
// 6. The user can select a city, and further actions can be implemented based on the selection.
```
