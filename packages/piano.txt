# Piano Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Piano package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  piano: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/piano).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable audio capabilities in your Xcode project settings. Open your project in Xcode, navigate to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab, and add "Audio" under "Background Modes".

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a basic piano interface.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:piano/piano.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Piano Example')),
        body: Piano(
          onNotePressed: (note) {
            // Handle note pressed
            print('Note pressed: $note');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple piano interface that prints the note pressed by the user. The `Piano` widget handles the rendering of the piano keys and the sound playback.

# Complete Example of the Piano Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:piano/piano.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Piano Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Piano(
            onNotePressed: (note) {
              // This callback is triggered when a piano key is pressed.
              // The 'note' parameter contains the note that was played.
              print('Note pressed: $note');
            },
            // You can customize the appearance of the piano keys here.
            keyColor: Colors.white,
            activeKeyColor: Colors.blue,
            // You can specify the number of octaves to display.
            numberOfOctaves: 2,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Piano Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Center widget that centers the Piano widget.
// 5. The Piano widget is configured to call the onNotePressed callback when a key is pressed.
// 6. The key colors and number of octaves are customizable.
// 7. When a key is pressed, the note is printed to the console.
