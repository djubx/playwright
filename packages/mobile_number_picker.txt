# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Mobile Number Picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `mobile_number_picker` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `mobile_number_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mobile_number_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions for internet access if your app requires it. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to configure your app's `Info.plist` file to allow for certain functionalities. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Mobile Number Picker

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the mobile number picker in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mobile_number_picker/mobile_number_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Mobile Number Picker Example',
      home: MobileNumberPickerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class MobileNumberPickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MobileNumberPickerDemoState createState() => _MobileNumberPickerDemoState();
}

class _MobileNumberPickerDemoState extends State<MobileNumberPickerDemo> {
  String? selectedNumber; // Variable to hold the selected mobile number

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Mobile Number Picker'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected mobile number
            Text(
              selectedNumber ?? 'No number selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open the mobile number picker
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Open the mobile number picker and wait for the result
                final number = await showDialog<String>(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) {
                    return MobileNumberPickerDialog(); // Open the picker dialog
                  },
                );
                // Update the selected number if a number was picked
                if (number != null) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedNumber = number; // Set the selected number
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick a Mobile Number'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the mobile_number_picker package.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home page.
// 3. The MobileNumberPickerDemo widget is a stateful widget that manages the selected mobile number.
// 4. In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget containing:
//    - A Text widget to display the selected mobile number or a default message.
//    - An ElevatedButton that, when pressed, opens the MobileNumberPickerDialog.
// 5. The dialog allows the user to pick a mobile number, and upon selection, the state is updated to reflect the chosen number.
// 
// This flow ensures a smooth user experience when selecting mobile numbers in the application.
