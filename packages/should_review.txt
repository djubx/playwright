# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Should Review Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **should_review** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  should_review: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request permission for in-app reviews:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to prompt users for a review.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:should_review/should_review.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Should Review Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the review prompt
              ShouldReview.requestReview();
            },
            child: Text('Rate Us'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the user taps the "Rate Us" button, the app will prompt them to leave a review.

# Complete Example of the Should Review Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:should_review/should_review.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Should Review Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the review prompt when the button is pressed
              ShouldReview.requestReview();
            },
            child: Text('Rate Us'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Should Review Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created with the text 'Rate Us'.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered, calling ShouldReview.requestReview().
// 7. This method prompts the user to leave a review for the app, enhancing user engagement and feedback collection.
