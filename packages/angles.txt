Here's a detailed technical blog on the "angles" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Angles Flutter Package

The **angles** Flutter package is a powerful library designed to simplify the manipulation and conversion of angles in various formats. It provides a set of utilities for working with angles in degrees, radians, and gradians, making it an essential tool for developers working on applications that require precise angle calculations, such as games, simulations, and graphical applications.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **angles** package when:
- You need to perform calculations involving angles, such as rotations or transformations.
- You are developing applications that require angle conversions between different units (degrees, radians, gradians).
- You want to simplify your code by using a dedicated library for angle manipulations instead of implementing your own functions.

## Features

- **Angle Conversion**: Easily convert between degrees, radians, and gradians.
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Access sine, cosine, and tangent functions directly in the desired angle format.
- **Angle Normalization**: Normalize angles to a standard range, which is useful for ensuring consistent behavior in calculations.
- **Comprehensive API**: A well-documented API that makes it easy to integrate into your Flutter applications.

With these features, the **angles** package can significantly reduce the complexity of angle-related calculations in your Flutter projects.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Angles Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **angles** package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  angles: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the **angles** package to start using it:

```dart
import 'package:angles/angles.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the **angles** package to convert angles and perform calculations:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create an angle in degrees
  Angle angleInDegrees = Angle.degrees(90);
  
  // Convert to radians
  double radians = angleInDegrees.radians;
  print('90 degrees in radians: $radians');

  // Calculate sine of the angle
  double sineValue = angleInDegrees.sin;
  print('Sine of 90 degrees: $sineValue');
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create an angle, convert it to radians, and calculate its sine value. You can expand upon this by using other features of the package as needed.

# Complete Example of Using the Angles Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:angles/angles.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Angles Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Angles Flutter Package Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AngleDisplay(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class AngleDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an angle of 45 degrees
    Angle angle = Angle.degrees(45);

    // Convert angle to radians
    double radians = angle.radians;

    // Calculate sine, cosine, and tangent of the angle
    double sineValue = angle.sin;
    double cosineValue = angle.cos;
    double tangentValue = angle.tan;

    // Display the results
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Angle: ${angle.degrees} degrees'),
        Text('Radians: $radians'),
        Text('Sine: $sineValue'),
        Text('Cosine: $cosineValue'),
        Text('Tangent: $tangentValue'),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the AngleDisplay widget.
// 4. The AngleDisplay widget creates an angle of 45 degrees and performs conversions and calculations.
// 5. The results (angle in degrees, radians, sine, cosine, and tangent) are displayed in a column format.
```
