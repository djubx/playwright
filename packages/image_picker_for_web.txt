# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Image Picker for Web

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `image_picker_for_web` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `image_picker_for_web` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_picker_for_web: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker_for_web).

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:image_picker_for_web/image_picker_for_web.dart';
```

## Step 3: Implementing the Image Picker

You can now use the `ImagePicker` class to select images. Below is a simple example of how to implement the image picker in your Flutter web application.

### Example Code Snippet

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_picker_for_web/image_picker_for_web.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String? _imageUrl;

  // Function to pick an image
  Future<void> _pickImage() async {
    // Use the ImagePicker to select an image
    final image = await ImagePickerWeb.getImageInfo;
    if (image != null) {
      setState(() {
        // Update the image URL to display the selected image
        _imageUrl = image.dataUrl;
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Picker for Web')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected image
            if (_imageUrl != null) Image.network(_imageUrl!),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImage,
              child: Text('Pick an Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

# Complete Example: RealFlutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_picker_for_web/image_picker_for_web.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String? _imageUrl; // Variable to hold the image URL

  // Function to pick an image
  Future<void> _pickImage() async {
    // Use the ImagePicker to select an image
    final image = await ImagePickerWeb.getImageInfo;
    if (image != null) {
      setState(() {
        // Update the image URL to display the selected image
        _imageUrl = image.dataUrl;
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Picker for Web')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected image if available
            if (_imageUrl != null) Image.network(_imageUrl!),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImage, // Call the image picker function
              child: Text('Pick an Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(), // Run the RealFlutter widget
  ));
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. The _RealFlutterState class manages the state of the widget.
// 4. When the user clicks the "Pick an Image" button, the _pickImage function is called.
// 5. The _pickImage function uses the ImagePickerWeb to select an image.
// 6. If an image is selected, the image URL is stored in the _imageUrl variable.
// 7. The selected image is displayed on the screen using the Image.network widget.
```
