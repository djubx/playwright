# Tutorial: Setting Up Klippa Identity Verification SDK

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `klippa_identity_verification_sdk` and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `klippa_identity_verification_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  klippa_identity_verification_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>

    <application
        android:label="your_app_name"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        <meta-data
            android:name="klippa.api_key"
            android:value="YOUR_API_KEY"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the required permissions in your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for identity verification.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library for identity verification.</string>
```

## Step 3: Initialize the SDK

In your Flutter application, you need to initialize the SDK before using it. This is typically done in the `main.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:klippa_identity_verification_sdk/klippa_identity_verification_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Klippa Identity Verification',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Using the SDK

You can now use the SDK to perform identity verification. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the verification process:

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Identity Verification')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Start the identity verification process
            final result = await KlippaIdentityVerificationSdk.startVerification();
            // Handle the result
            if (result.isSuccessful) {
              // Verification successful
              print('Verification successful: ${result.data}');
            } else {
              // Verification failed
              print('Verification failed: ${result.error}');
            }
          },
          child: Text('Verify Identity'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application with a button that initiates the identity verification process when pressed.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:klippa_identity_verification_sdk/klippa_identity_verification_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Klippa Identity Verification',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Identity Verification')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Start the identity verification process
            final result = await KlippaIdentityVerificationSdk.startVerification();
            // Handle the result
            if (result.isSuccessful) {
              // Verification successful
              print('Verification successful: ${result.data}');
            } else {
              // Verification failed
              print('Verification failed: ${result.error}');
            }
          },
          child: Text('Verify Identity'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, containing a button to initiate identity verification.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the startVerification method from the Klippa SDK is called.
// 4. The result of the verification process is awaited.
// 5. If the verification is successful, the success message and data are printed to the console.
// 6. If the verification fails, the error message is printed to the console.
```
