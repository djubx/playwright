// This code demonstrates the usage of the launch_counter package in a Flutter app.
// The app displays the launch count on the screen and provides a button to reset the launch count.
// When the app is launched, it retrieves the launch count using the getLaunchCount() function and displays it on the screen.
// When the reset button is pressed, it resets the launch count using the resetLaunchCount() function and updates the display.
// The launch count is stored locally on the device using the shared_preferences package.
