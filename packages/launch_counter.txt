# Launch Counter Flutter Package

The **launch_counter** Flutter package is a simple yet effective tool designed to track the number of times an application has been launched. This package is particularly useful for developers who want to gather analytics on app usage, implement features based on user engagement, or simply display a counter to users.

## When to Use This Package
- **User Engagement Tracking**: If you want to understand how often users are opening your app.
- **Feature Unlocking**: To unlock features based on the number of launches.
- **Analytics**: To collect data for analytics purposes.

## Features
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate and use within your Flutter application.
- **Persistent Storage**: Utilizes shared preferences to store the launch count, ensuring the data persists across app restarts.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to reset the counter or retrieve the current count easily.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Launch Counter

## Installation
To add the **launch_counter** package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  launch_counter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. The package uses shared preferences, which are supported out of the box.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the necessary permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you plan to use any features that require user data.

## Usage
To use the **launch_counter** package, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Here’s how to do it:

1. Import the package.
2. Create an instance of the `LaunchCounter` class.
3. Call the `incrementLaunchCount()` method to increase the count each time the app is launched.

Here’s a simple example of how to implement this in your Flutter app.

# Complete Example of Launch Counter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:launch_counter/launch_counter.dart'; // Import the launch_counter package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int launchCount = 0; // Variable to hold the launch count

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _incrementLaunchCount(); // Increment the launch count on app start
  }

  // Method to increment the launch count
  Future<void> _incrementLaunchCount() async {
    // Create an instance of LaunchCounter
    final launchCounter = LaunchCounter();
    
    // Increment the launch count
    launchCount = await launchCounter.incrementLaunchCount();
    
    // Update the state to reflect the new launch count
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Launch Counter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Launch Counter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'This app has been launched $launchCount times.', // Display the launch count
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code defines a simple Flutter application that tracks how many times it has been launched.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by calling `runApp` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that maintains the launch count.
// 3. In the `initState` method, we call `_incrementLaunchCount` to update the count when the app starts.
// 4. The `_incrementLaunchCount` method creates an instance of `LaunchCounter`, increments the count, and updates the state.
// 5. The `build` method constructs the UI, displaying the launch count in the center of the screen.
