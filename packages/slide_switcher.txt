```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'

# Complete Example of Slide Switcher

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:slide_switcher/slide_switcher.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Slide Switcher Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Slide Switcher Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SlideSwitcher(
            // The initial state of the switch
            value: false,
            // Callback function when the switch is toggled
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Handle the switch state change
              print('Switch is now: $value');
            },
            // Customizing the appearance
            activeColor: Colors.green,
            inactiveColor: Colors.red,
            // Optional: Adding labels for the switch states
            labels: ['Off', 'On'],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Slide Switcher Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The SlideSwitcher widget is placed in the center, initialized with a value of false (off).
// 6. The onChanged callback is triggered whenever the switch is toggled, printing the new state to the console.
// 7. The switch is styled with active and inactive colors, and labels are provided for clarity.
