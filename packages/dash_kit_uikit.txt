```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dash_kit_uikit/dash_kit_uikit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a Material app with a DashKit theme
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Real Flutter',
      theme: DashKitThemeData(),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a scaffold with a DashButton
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Real Flutter'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: DashButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Handle button press
            print('Button pressed!');
          },
          child: Text('Click me!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The app starts by creating a Material app with a DashKit theme.
// This theme is used to style the app's UI components.
// The home page is a stateless widget that creates a scaffold with a DashButton.
// When the button is pressed, it prints a message to the console.
// The app's layout is centered, with the button in the middle of the screen.
// The DashButton is a pre-built UI component provided by the dash_kit_uikit package.
// It can be customized to fit the app's unique style.

// In summary, this code creates a simple Flutter app with a DashKit theme and a DashButton.
// The app's layout is centered, and the button is styled using the DashKit theme.
// When the button is pressed, it prints a message to the console.
