# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Custom Circular Progress

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `custom_circular_progress` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `custom_circular_progress` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  custom_circular_progress: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `custom_circular_progress` widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_circular_progress/custom_circular_progress.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom Circular Progress Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Custom Circular Progress'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomCircularProgress(
            progress: 0.7, // Set progress value between 0.0 and 1.0
            strokeWidth: 8.0, // Width of the circular progress line
            backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color of the circle
            progressColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the progress line
            text: 'Loading...', // Optional text to display
            textStyle: TextStyle(
              fontSize: 20,
              color: Colors.black,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays a circular progress indicator in the center of the screen. The `CustomCircularProgress` widget is configured with a progress value, stroke width, background color, progress color, and optional text.

## Conclusion

You have now successfully set up and used the `custom_circular_progress` package in your Flutter application. This package provides a flexible way to enhance user experience by visually indicating progress during loading or processing tasks.
