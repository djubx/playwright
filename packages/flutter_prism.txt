# Setting Up and Using `flutter_prism`

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_prism`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_prism: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package. After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain capabilities in your `Info.plist` file, depending on the features you plan to use. However, for basic usage, no additional configuration is typically required.

## Using `flutter_prism`
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a gradient background with shadow effects.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_prism/flutter_prism.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Prism Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Prism(
          gradient: LinearGradient(
            colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
            begin: Alignment.topLeft,
            end: Alignment.bottomRight,
          ),
          shadow: Shadow(
            color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5),
            offset: Offset(4, 4),
            blurRadius: 10,
          ),
          child: Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 200,
            child: Center(child: Text('Hello, Prism!')),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a `Prism` widget that applies a linear gradient and a shadow effect to a container. The `Prism` widget takes care of rendering the visual effects seamlessly.

# Complete Example of `flutter_prism`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_prism/flutter_prism.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Prism Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Prism Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using the Prism widget to create a visually appealing container
          child: Prism(
            // Defining a linear gradient for the background
            gradient: LinearGradient(
              colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
              begin: Alignment.topLeft,
              end: Alignment.bottomRight,
            ),
            // Adding shadow effects to the Prism widget
            shadow: Shadow(
              color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5), // Shadow color
              offset: Offset(4, 4), // Shadow offset
              blurRadius: 10, // Blur radius for the shadow
            ),
            // Child widget that will be displayed inside the Prism
            child: Container(
              width: 200, // Width of the container
              height: 200, // Height of the container
              // Centering the text inside the container
              child: Center(child: Text('Hello, Prism!', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20))),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, we use the Prism widget to create a visually appealing effect.
// 5. The Prism widget applies a linear gradient and shadow to the child Container.
// 6. The Container displays centered text, creating a visually striking UI element.
