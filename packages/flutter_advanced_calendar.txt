# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_advanced_calendar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_advanced_calendar` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_advanced_calendar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_advanced_calendar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include any necessary permissions, especially if you plan to access the device's calendar. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your calendar.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `flutter_advanced_calendar` in your app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_advanced_calendar/flutter_advanced_calendar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Advanced Calendar Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CalendarHome(),
    );
  }
}

class CalendarHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CalendarHomeState createState() => _CalendarHomeState();
}

class _CalendarHomeState extends State<CalendarHome> {
  // Initialize the calendar controller
  late CalendarController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Create a new CalendarController instance
    _controller = CalendarController();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Advanced Calendar'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Display the calendar widget
          Expanded(
            child: AdvancedCalendar(
              controller: _controller,
              onDateSelected: (date) {
                // Handle date selection
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Selected date: $date')),
                );
              },
              // Customize the calendar appearance
              calendarStyle: CalendarStyle(
                todayColor: Colors.blueAccent,
                selectedColor: Colors.green,
                weekendColor: Colors.red,
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The CalendarHome widget is created, which manages the state of the calendar.
// 4. A CalendarController is initialized in the initState method to control the calendar's behavior.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and an AdvancedCalendar widget.
// 6. The AdvancedCalendar widget displays the calendar and handles date selection.
// 7. When a date is selected, a SnackBar shows the selected date to the user.
// 8. The controller is disposed of in the dispose method to free up resources when the widget is removed.
```
