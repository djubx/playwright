    sdk: flutter
  flutter_country_state: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_country_state).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

## Using the Package
To use the `flutter_country_state` package, you can follow these steps:

1. **Import the Package**:
   At the top of your Dart file, import the package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_country_state/flutter_country_state.dart';
   ```

2. **Create a Stateful Widget**:
   You will need a stateful widget to manage the selected country and state.

3. **Initialize the Country and State Data**:
   Use the provided methods to fetch the list of countries and states.

4. **Build the UI**:

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_country_state/flutter_country_state.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String? selectedCountry; // Variable to hold the selected country
  String? selectedState; // Variable to hold the selected state
  List<String> countries = []; // List to store country names
  List<String> states = []; // List to store state names

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch the list of countries when the widget is initialized
    countries = CountryState.getCountries();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Country and State Selector')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Dropdown for selecting country
              DropdownButton<String>(
                hint: Text('Select Country'),
                value: selectedCountry,
                onChanged: (String? newValue) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedCountry = newValue; // Update selected country
                    states = CountryState.getStates(newValue!); // Fetch states for the selected country
                    selectedState = null; // Reset selected state
                  });
                },
                items: countries.map<DropdownMenuItem<String>>((String country) {
                  return DropdownMenuItem<String>(
                    value: country,
                    child: Text(country),
                  );
                }).toList(),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Dropdown for selecting state
              DropdownButton<String>(
                hint: Text('Select State'),
                value: selectedState,
                onChanged: (String? newValue) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedState = newValue; // Update selected state
                  });
                },
                items: states.map<DropdownMenuItem<String>>((String state) {
                  return DropdownMenuItem<String>(
                    value: state,
                    child: Text(state),
                  );
                }).toList(),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we define two variables to hold the selected country and state.
// 3. The initState method is overridden to fetch the list of countries when the widget is initialized.
// 4. The build method creates a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing two dropdowns.
// 5. The first dropdown allows users to select a country. When a country is selected, the corresponding states are fetched.
// 6. The second dropdown allows users to select a state based on the selected country.
// 7. The UI updates dynamically as users make selections, providing a seamless experience.
