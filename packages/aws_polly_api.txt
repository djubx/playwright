# Overview of the aws_polly_api Flutter Package

The `aws_polly_api` package is a Flutter plugin that provides a simple interface to interact with Amazon Polly, a service that turns text into lifelike speech. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to add text-to-speech capabilities to their applications, enhancing accessibility and user engagement.

## When to Use This Package
- **Accessibility**: To make applications more accessible for users with visual impairments.
- **Interactive Applications**: For apps that require voice feedback or narration, such as educational tools or games.
- **Content Consumption**: To allow users to listen to articles, books, or other text content.

## Key Features
- **Multiple Voices**: Supports various languages and voices, allowing for a personalized user experience.
- **Custom Speech Parameters**: Adjust speech rate, pitch, and volume to suit user preferences.
- **Streamed Audio**: Provides the ability to stream audio directly from the service, reducing latency and improving performance.

Overall, the `aws_polly_api` package is a powerful tool for developers looking to integrate advanced text-to-speech functionalities into their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using aws_polly_api

## Installation
To add the `aws_polly_api` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  aws_polly_api: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/aws_polly_api).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions for network access.

## Using the Package
To use the `aws_polly_api` package, you need to initialize it with your AWS credentials. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:aws_polly_api/aws_polly_api.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final Polly polly;

  RealFlutter(String accessKey, String secretKey)
      : polly = Polly(
          region: 'us-east-1', // Specify your AWS region
          credentials: AwsClientCredentials(
            accessKey: accessKey,
            secretKey: secretKey,
          ),
        );

  Future<void> synthesizeSpeech(String text) async {
    final response = await polly.synthesizeSpeech(
      text: text,
      outputFormat: OutputFormat.mp3,
      voiceId: VoiceId.joanna, // Choose a voice
    );

    // Handle the audio stream here
  }
}
```

This code initializes the `Polly` client with your AWS credentials and provides a method to synthesize speech from text.

# Complete Example of Using aws_polly_api

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:aws_polly_api/aws_polly_api.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AWS Polly Example',
      home: PollyHome(),
    );
  }
}

class PollyHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PollyHomeState createState() => _PollyHomeState();
}

class _PollyHomeState extends State<PollyHome> {
  final Polly polly = Polly(
    region: 'us-east-1',
    credentials: AwsClientCredentials(
      accessKey: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY', // Replace with your access key
      secretKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY', // Replace with your secret key
    ),
  );

  String _textToSpeak = "Hello, welcome to the AWS Polly example!";
  String _audioUrl;

  // Function to synthesize speech
  Future<void> _synthesizeSpeech() async {
    try {
      final response = await polly.synthesizeSpeech(
        text: _textToSpeak,
        outputFormat: OutputFormat.mp3,
        voiceId: VoiceId.joanna,
      );

      // Assuming the response contains a URL to the audio
      setState(() {
        _audioUrl = response.audioStream; // Store the audio stream URL
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error synthesizing speech: $e");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('AWS Polly Text-to-Speech'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_textToSpeak),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _synthesizeSpeech,
              child: Text('Speak'),
            ),
            if (_audioUrl != null) ...[
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text('Audio URL: $_audioUrl'),
              // Here you would typically play the audio using an audio player
            ],
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. PollyHome is the main screen where the user can see the text and a button to synthesize speech.
// 3. When the user presses the "Speak" button, the _synthesizeSpeech function is called.
// 4. This function interacts with the AWS Polly service to convert the text into speech.
// 5. Upon successful synthesis, the audio stream URL is stored and displayed on the screen.
// 6. The user can then use this URL to play the audio (not implemented in this example).
