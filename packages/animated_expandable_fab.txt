# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Expandable FAB

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `animated_expandable_fab` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_expandable_fab: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:animated_expandable_fab/animated_expandable_fab.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

You can now use the `AnimatedExpandableFab` widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_expandable_fab/animated_expandable_fab.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Expandable FAB Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Press the FAB to expand!')),
      floatingActionButton: AnimatedExpandableFab(
        distance: 112.0, // Distance between the main FAB and the expanded buttons
        children: [
          FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action for first button
            },
            child: Icon(Icons.message),
          ),
          FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action for second button
            },
            child: Icon(Icons.share),
          ),
          FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action for third button
            },
            child: Icon(Icons.post_add),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Optimizations

- **Performance**: The package is optimized for performance, but always test on real devices to ensure smooth animations.
- **Accessibility**: Consider adding accessibility labels to your buttons for better usability.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `animated_expandable_fab` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Animated Expandable FAB

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_expandable_fab/animated_expandable_fab.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Expandable FAB Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Press the FAB to expand!')),
      // The main Floating Action Button that expands into multiple buttons
      floatingActionButton: AnimatedExpandableFab(
        distance: 112.0, // Distance between the main FAB and the expanded buttons
        children: [
          // First action button
          FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action for the first button
              print('Message button pressed');
            },
            child: Icon(Icons.message), // Icon for the first button
          ),
          // Second action button
          FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action for the second button
              print('Share button pressed');
            },
            child: Icon(Icons.share), // Icon for the second button
          ),
          // Third action button
          FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action for the third button
              print('Post button pressed');
            },
            child: Icon(Icons.post_add), // Icon for the third button
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The Scaffold widget provides the basic structure of the app, including an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body contains a Center widget with a simple text message.
// 4. The floatingActionButton property of the Scaffold is where the AnimatedExpandableFab is used.
// 5. The AnimatedExpandableFab takes a distance parameter that defines how far the buttons will be from the main FAB.
// 6. The children property contains a list of FloatingActionButtons, each with its own onPressed action.
// 7. When the main FAB is pressed, it expands to reveal the additional buttons, allowing the user to select an action.
// 8. Each button has a print statement in its onPressed callback, which can be replaced with actual functionality as needed.
```
