# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Pixel Perfect

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the pixel_perfect package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  pixel_perfect: ^1.0.0
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
To use the pixel_perfect package, you can wrap your widget tree with the `PixelPerfect` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pixel_perfect/pixel_perfect.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return PixelPerfect(
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pixel Perfect Example')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Hello, Pixel Perfect!')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This wraps your entire application in a `PixelPerfect` widget, ensuring that all child widgets are rendered with pixel-perfect accuracy.

# Complete Example of Pixel Perfect in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pixel_perfect/pixel_perfect.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pixel Perfect Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return PixelPerfect(
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Pixel Perfect Example'),
          backgroundColor: Colors.blueAccent,
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a text widget
              Text(
                'Hello, Pixel Perfect!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
              // Displaying a button
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action when button is pressed
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Press Me'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter is wrapped in a PixelPerfect widget to ensure pixel-perfect rendering.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a structure with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The AppBar displays the title 'Pixel Perfect Example'.
// 6. The body contains a Center widget that centers its children.
// 7. Inside the Center, a Column widget arranges its children vertically.
// 8. The first child is a Text widget displaying 'Hello, Pixel Perfect!'.
// 9. A SizedBox adds space between the Text and the Button.
// 10. The ElevatedButton shows a SnackBar when pressed, providing user feedback.
