# Widget Tooltip Flutter Package

The `widget_tooltip` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to enhance user experience by providing contextual information through tooltips. Tooltips are small pop-up boxes that appear when a user hovers over or taps on a widget, offering additional information about that widget's function or purpose. This package is particularly useful in applications where user guidance is essential, such as onboarding processes, complex forms, or interactive tutorials.

## When to Use

- **Onboarding**: When introducing new features to users, tooltips can guide them through the app.
- **Complex Forms**: In forms with many fields, tooltips can clarify what information is required.
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Tooltips can provide step-by-step instructions for using an app.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily customize the tooltip's appearance, including colors, shapes, and text styles.
- **Positioning Options**: The package allows you to position tooltips relative to the target widget, ensuring they are always visible.
- **Animation Support**: Tooltips can be animated for a smoother user experience.
- **Accessibility**: The package supports accessibility features, making it easier for all users to interact with your app.

By leveraging the `widget_tooltip` package, developers can create more intuitive and user-friendly applications that guide users effectively through their interactions.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Widget Tooltip Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `widget_tooltip` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  widget_tooltip: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:widget_tooltip/widget_tooltip.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

You can use the `WidgetTooltip` class to create tooltips. Here’s a simple example of how to implement a tooltip on a button:

```dart
WidgetTooltip(
  message: 'This is a tooltip message!',
  child: ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: () {},
    child: Text('Hover or Tap me!'),
  ),
);
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if your tooltips require specific functionalities. However, basic tooltips do not require additional configurations.

## Step 4: Customizing Tooltips

You can customize the tooltip's appearance and behavior. Here’s an example:

```dart
WidgetTooltip(
  message: 'Custom Tooltip',
  backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
  textStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
  child: Icon(Icons.info),
);
```

This customization allows you to match the tooltip's design with your app's theme.

## Step 5: Advanced Features

The `widget_tooltip` package also supports animations and positioning. You can specify the position of the tooltip relative to the widget:

```dart
WidgetTooltip(
  message: 'Animated Tooltip',
  preferBelow: false,
  animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
  child: Icon(Icons.help),
);
```

This example shows how to position the tooltip above the widget and add a custom animation duration.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate and utilize the `widget_tooltip` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using Widget Tooltip

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_tooltip/widget_tooltip.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Widget Tooltip Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Widget Tooltip Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Tooltip for the first button
              WidgetTooltip(
                message: 'This button does something!',
                child: ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Action for the button
                  },
                  child: Text('Button 1'),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between buttons
              // Tooltip for the second button
              WidgetTooltip(
                message: 'This button does something else!',
                child: ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Action for the button
                  },
                  child: Text('Button 2'),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Widget Tooltip Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column with two buttons.
// 5. Each button is wrapped in a WidgetTooltip, providing contextual information when hovered or tapped.
// 6. The first button has a tooltip message indicating its action, and the second button has a different tooltip message.
// 7. When the user interacts with the buttons, the corresponding actions can be defined in the onPressed callbacks.
```
