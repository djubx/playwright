<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# flutter_local_auth_invisible Package Overview

The `flutter_local_auth_invisible` package is a powerful Flutter plugin that allows developers to implement local authentication features seamlessly and invisibly. This package is particularly useful for applications that require secure user authentication without interrupting the user experience with visible prompts. 

## When to Use This Package
- **Biometric Authentication**: When you want to authenticate users using biometrics (fingerprint, face recognition) without showing any UI prompts.
- **Background Authentication**: For applications that need to perform authentication in the background, such as unlocking sensitive data or features.
- **Enhanced Security**: When you want to enhance the security of your app by ensuring that sensitive actions are only performed by authenticated users.

## Features
- **Invisible Authentication**: Authenticate users without displaying any UI, providing a seamless experience.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, leveraging the native biometric capabilities of each platform.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to customize the authentication process according to their app's needs.

This package is ideal for applications that prioritize user experience while maintaining high security standards.

# Tutorial: Setting Up flutter_local_auth_invisible

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_local_auth_invisible` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `flutter_local_auth_invisible` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_local_auth_invisible: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission for biometric authentication:

```xml
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>We use Face ID to authenticate you.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Import the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_local_auth_invisible/flutter_local_auth_invisible.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the package to authenticate users. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
void authenticateUser() async {
  final localAuth = FlutterLocalAuthInvisible();
  bool authenticated = await localAuth.authenticate();
  if (authenticated) {
    // User authenticated successfully
  } else {
    // Authentication failed
  }
}
```

This function will attempt to authenticate the user invisibly. You can call this function whenever you need to perform authentication in your app.

# Complete Example of flutter_local_auth_invisible

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_local_auth_invisible/flutter_local_auth_invisible.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Invisible Local Auth Demo',
      home: AuthHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class AuthHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AuthHomePageState createState() => _AuthHomePageState();
}

class _AuthHomePageState extends State<AuthHomePage> {
  final FlutterLocalAuthInvisible localAuth = FlutterLocalAuthInvisible();
  String _authStatus = 'Not Authenticated';

  // Function to authenticate the user
  void _authenticate() async {
    // Attempt to authenticate the user invisibly
    bool authenticated = await localAuth.authenticate();
    setState(() {
      // Update the authentication status based on the result
      _authStatus = authenticated ? 'Authenticated' : 'Authentication Failed';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Invisible Local Auth Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Authentication Status: $_authStatus',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _authenticate,
              child: Text('Authenticate'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets AuthHomePage as the home widget.
// 3. AuthHomePageState manages the authentication process.
// 4. When the user presses the "Authenticate" button, the _authenticate function is called.
// 5. _authenticate uses the FlutterLocalAuthInvisible package to attempt authentication invisibly.
// 6. The authentication status is updated based on the result and displayed on the screen.
```
