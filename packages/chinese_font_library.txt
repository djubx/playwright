# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Chinese Font Library

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `chinese_font_library` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  chinese_font_library: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Configuring for Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions and configurations in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. You may need to add custom font files to your project:

1. Place your font files in the `android/app/src/main/assets/fonts` directory.
2. Update your `AndroidManifest.xml` if necessary, but typically, no additional configuration is required for fonts.

## Step 4: Configuring for iOS
For iOS, you need to ensure that the font files are included in your project:

1. Add your font files to the `ios/Runner` directory.
2. Update your `Info.plist` file to include the fonts:

```xml
<key>UIAppFonts</key>
<array>
    <string>your_chinese_font.ttf</string>
</array>
```

## Step 5: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Here’s how to apply a Chinese font to your text widgets:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chinese_font_library/chinese_font_library.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Chinese Font Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            '你好，世界', // "Hello, World" in Chinese
            style: TextStyle(
              fontFamily: 'YourChineseFont', // Use the font you added
              fontSize: 24,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

This code demonstrates how to use the `chinese_font_library` package to display Chinese text in your Flutter application. Make sure to replace `'YourChineseFont'` with the actual name of the font you are using.

# Complete Example of Using the Chinese Font Library

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chinese_font_library/chinese_font_library.dart';

// Main class of the Flutter application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Chinese Font Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            '你好，世界', // "Hello, World" in Chinese
            style: TextStyle(
              fontFamily: 'YourChineseFont', // Specify the Chinese font
              fontSize: 24, // Set the font size
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which is the root of the application.
3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, providing a structure for the app.
4. An AppBar is added to the Scaffold, displaying the title "Chinese Font Example".
5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child widget.
6. The child of the Center widget is a Text widget that displays "你好，世界" (Hello, World) in a specified Chinese font.
7. The font size is set to 24, making the text easily readable.
8. The application is now ready to display Chinese text using the specified font, ensuring proper localization for Chinese-speaking users.
