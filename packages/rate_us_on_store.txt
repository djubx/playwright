# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Rate Us on Store Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `rate_us_on_store` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rate_us_on_store: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/rate_us_on_store).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow the app to prompt for ratings:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to implement it in your main application file.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rate_us_on_store/rate_us_on_store.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rate Us Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rate Us on Store Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Call the rate us function when the button is pressed
              RateUsOnStore.rateUs();
            },
            child: Text('Rate Us'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the user taps the "Rate Us" button, the app will prompt them to rate it on the respective app store.

# Complete Example of Rate Us on Store

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rate_us_on_store/rate_us_on_store.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rate Us Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rate Us on Store Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Call the rate us function when the button is pressed
              RateUsOnStore.rateUs();
            },
            child: Text('Rate Us'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Rate Us on Store Example".
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created with the text "Rate Us".
// 6. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered, calling the RateUsOnStore.rateUs() method.
// 7. This method prompts the user to rate the app on the respective app store, enhancing user engagement and feedback collection.
