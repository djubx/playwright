# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Shadow Overlay

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **shadow_overlay** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  shadow_overlay: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:shadow_overlay/shadow_overlay.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Shadow Overlay

You can now use the `ShadowOverlay` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to apply it to a button:

```dart
ShadowOverlay(
  shadowColor: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5),
  blurRadius: 10.0,
  offset: Offset(0, 4),
  child: ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: () {
      // Button action
    },
    child: Text('Click Me'),
  ),
);
```

This code snippet creates a button with a shadow overlay, enhancing its visibility and appeal.

# Complete Example of Shadow Overlay

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shadow_overlay/shadow_overlay.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Shadow Overlay Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Shadow Overlay Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ShadowOverlay(
            // Setting the shadow properties
            shadowColor: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5), // Shadow color
            blurRadius: 10.0, // Blur radius of the shadow
            offset: Offset(0, 4), // Offset of the shadow
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Hello!'),
                    content: Text('This is a shadow overlay example.'),
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () {
                          Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                        },
                        child: Text('Close'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Show Overlay'),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a ShadowOverlay wraps an ElevatedButton.
// 5. The ShadowOverlay applies a shadow effect to the button, enhancing its appearance.
// 6. When the button is pressed, a dialog is shown with a message and a close button.
// 7. Pressing the close button dismisses the dialog, returning to the main screen.
