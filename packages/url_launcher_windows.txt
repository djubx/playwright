# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `url_launcher_windows`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `url_launcher_windows` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  url_launcher_windows: ^0.0.1  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:url_launcher_windows/url_launcher_windows.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the `launchUrl` method to open URLs. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

### Example Code
```dart
void launchURL(String url) async {
  if (await canLaunch(url)) {
    await launch(url);
  } else {
    throw 'Could not launch $url';
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Windows**: The package uses the default web browser to open URLs.
- **Android/iOS**: The package behaves similarly, launching the default browser or application associated with the URL scheme.

## Step 5: Configurations and Optimizations
- Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to access the internet.
- For Android, make sure to add the following permission in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

- For iOS, ensure that you have the appropriate settings in your `Info.plist` to allow outgoing connections.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate and use the `url_launcher_windows` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using `url_launcher_windows`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:url_launcher_windows/url_launcher_windows.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'URL Launcher Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('URL Launcher Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Define the URL to be launched
              String url = 'https://flutter.dev';
              // Call the launchURL function to open the URL
              launchURL(url);
            },
            child: Text('Open Flutter Website'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to launch the URL
  void launchURL(String url) async {
    // Check if the URL can be launched
    if (await canLaunch(url)) {
      // Launch the URL
      await launch(url);
    } else {
      // Throw an error if the URL cannot be launched
      throw 'Could not launch $url';
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the launchURL function is called with the specified URL.
// 5. The launchURL function checks if the URL can be launched using canLaunch().
// 6. If the URL can be launched, it is opened in the default web browser using launch().
// 7. If the URL cannot be launched, an error is thrown, indicating the failure to launch the URL.
```
