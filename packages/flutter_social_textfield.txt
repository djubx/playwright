# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_social_textfield

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_social_textfield` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_social_textfield` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_social_textfield: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `SocialTextField` widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_social_textfield/flutter_social_textfield.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Social TextField Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Social TextField for entering social media handles
              SocialTextField(
                hintText: 'Enter your social media handle',
                onChanged: (value) {
                  // Handle the input value
                  print('Input: $value');
                },
                // You can customize the appearance
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  border: OutlineInputBorder(),
                  labelText: 'Social Handle',
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that includes a `SocialTextField` widget. The `onChanged` callback allows us to capture the input value in real-time.

# Complete Example of flutter_social_textfield

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_social_textfield/flutter_social_textfield.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Social TextField Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Social TextField for entering social media handles
              SocialTextField(
                hintText: 'Enter your social media handle',
                onChanged: (value) {
                  // Handle the input value
                  print('Input: $value');
                },
                // You can customize the appearance
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  border: OutlineInputBorder(),
                  labelText: 'Social Handle',
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body consists of a Padding widget that wraps a Column widget, allowing for vertical layout.
// 4. Inside the Column, we have a SocialTextField widget that prompts the user to enter their social media handle.
// 5. The onChanged callback captures the input value and prints it to the console, allowing for real-time feedback.
// 6. The decoration property customizes the appearance of the text field, including the border and label text.
```
