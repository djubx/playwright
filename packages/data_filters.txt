# Overview of the `data_filters` Flutter Package

The `data_filters` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to filter and manipulate data collections efficiently. This package is particularly useful in applications that require dynamic data handling, such as e-commerce platforms, data dashboards, and any app that deals with large datasets.

## When to Use `data_filters`
- **Dynamic Filtering**: When you need to allow users to filter data based on various criteria.
- **Data Manipulation**: When you want to sort, group, or transform data collections.
- **Performance Optimization**: When working with large datasets, this package can help optimize performance by providing efficient filtering methods.

## Key Features
- **Flexible Filtering**: Supports multiple filter conditions and logical operators.
- **Sorting and Grouping**: Easily sort and group data based on specified fields.
- **Custom Filter Functions**: Allows developers to define custom filter logic.
- **Reactive Updates**: Automatically updates the filtered data when the source data changes.

The `data_filters` package is an essential addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit, especially for applications that require robust data handling capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `data_filters`

## Installation
To add the `data_filters` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  data_filters: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `data_filters` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no specific platform configurations required for basic usage. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

## Basic Usage
To use the `data_filters` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:data_filters/data_filters.dart';
```

### Example Setup
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up and use the `data_filters` package in your Flutter application:

1. **Define Your Data Model**: Create a data model that represents the items you want to filter.
2. **Create a Filter**: Use the provided filtering methods to filter your data based on user input or predefined criteria.

This package provides a straightforward API for filtering data collections, making it easy to integrate into your existing Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using `data_filters`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:data_filters/data_filters.dart'; // Importing the data_filters package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Data Filters Example',
      home: DataFilterScreen(), // Home screen of the application
    );
  }
}

class DataFilterScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DataFilterScreenState createState() => _DataFilterScreenState();
}

class _DataFilterScreenState extends State<DataFilterScreen> {
  List<Item> items = []; // List to hold the data items
  List<Item> filteredItems = []; // List to hold filtered items

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initializing the data items
    items = [
      Item(name: 'Apple', category: 'Fruit'),
      Item(name: 'Carrot', category: 'Vegetable'),
      Item(name: 'Banana', category: 'Fruit'),
      Item(name: 'Broccoli', category: 'Vegetable'),
    ];
    filteredItems = items; // Initially, all items are displayed
  }

  // Method to filter items based on category
  void filterItems(String category) {
    // Using the data_filters package to filter items
    filteredItems = items.where((item) => item.category == category).toList();
    setState(() {}); // Updating the UI with filtered items
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Data Filters Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Dropdown for selecting category to filter
          DropdownButton<String>(
            hint: Text('Select Category'),
            onChanged: (value) {
              if (value != null) {
                filterItems(value); // Filtering items based on selected category
              }
            },
            items: ['Fruit', 'Vegetable']
                .map((category) => DropdownMenuItem(
                      value: category,
                      child: Text(category),
                    ))
                .toList(),
          ),
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: filteredItems.length, // Count of filtered items
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(filteredItems[index].name), // Displaying item name
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Data model for items
class Item {
  final String name;
  final String category;

  Item({required this.name, required this.category});
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp and points to the DataFilterScreen.
3. In the DataFilterScreen, we initialize a list of items and a filtered list.
4. The filterItems method filters the items based on the selected category from the dropdown.
5. The UI consists of a dropdown for category selection and a list view to display filtered items.
6. When a category is selected, the filterItems method is called, updating the filteredItems list.
7. The ListView.builder displays the filtered items dynamically based on user selection.
