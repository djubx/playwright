# Overview of the Signal Flutter Package

The **Signal** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed for real-time communication in Flutter applications. It provides a robust framework for building chat applications, notifications, and any feature that requires instant data exchange between users. The package leverages the Signal Protocol, which is known for its strong encryption and security features, making it an excellent choice for applications that prioritize user privacy.

## When to Use Signal
- **Chat Applications**: Ideal for building secure messaging apps.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Useful for applications that need to push notifications instantly.
- **Collaborative Tools**: Great for apps that require real-time updates, such as collaborative document editing.

## Key Features
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensures that messages are secure and can only be read by the intended recipients.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows developers to quickly implement real-time features.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a large number of users and messages efficiently.

# Setting Up the Signal Flutter Package

To get started with the Signal package, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     signal: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

2. **Run Flutter Packages Get**: Execute the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
- Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions for internet access:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
- For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow for network requests:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Basic Usage

To use the Signal package, you will need to initialize it and set up listeners for incoming messages. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:signal/signal.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  Signal signal;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    signal = Signal();
    signal.initialize();
    
    // Listen for incoming messages
    signal.onMessageReceived.listen((message) {
      // Handle incoming message
      print("New message: $message");
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Signal Example")),
      body: Center(child: Text("Signal is set up!")),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the Signal package and sets up a listener for incoming messages.

# Complete Example of Using the Signal Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:signal/signal.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  Signal signal; // Declare the Signal instance
  String message = ""; // Variable to hold the message

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    signal = Signal(); // Initialize the Signal instance
    signal.initialize(); // Set up the Signal connection

    // Listen for incoming messages
    signal.onMessageReceived.listen((incomingMessage) {
      // Update the state with the new message
      setState(() {
        message = incomingMessage; // Store the incoming message
      });
      print("New message: $incomingMessage"); // Log the incoming message
    });
  }

  // Function to send a message
  void sendMessage(String msg) {
    signal.sendMessage(msg); // Use the Signal instance to send a message
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Signal Example")),
        body: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text("Received Message: $message"), // Display the received message
            TextField(
              onSubmitted: (text) {
                sendMessage(text); // Send the message when submitted
              },
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: "Type a message"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The application starts with the `main()` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. In the `initState()` method, an instance of the Signal class is created and initialized.
// 4. A listener is set up to listen for incoming messages. When a message is received, the state is updated to display the new message.
// 5. The `build()` method constructs the UI, which includes a TextField for user input and a Text widget to display the received message.
// 6. When the user submits a message in the TextField, the `sendMessage()` function is called, which sends the message using the Signal instance.
// 7. The application continuously listens for incoming messages and updates the UI accordingly.
