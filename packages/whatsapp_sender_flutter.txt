# Complete Example of WhatsApp Sender Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:whatsapp_sender_flutter/whatsapp_sender_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'WhatsApp Sender Example',
      home: WhatsAppSenderScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class WhatsAppSenderScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final TextEditingController _phoneController = TextEditingController();
  final TextEditingController _messageController = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('WhatsApp Sender'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              controller: _phoneController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Phone Number'),
              keyboardType: TextInputType.phone,
            ),
            TextField(
              controller: _messageController,
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Message'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Retrieve the phone number and message from the text fields
                String phoneNumber = _phoneController.text;
                String message = _messageController.text;

                // Call the sendMessage function to send the message via WhatsApp
                WhatsAppSender.sendMessage(phoneNumber, message);
              },
              child: Text('Send Message'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets WhatsAppSenderScreen as the home.
// 3. WhatsAppSenderScreen contains two text fields for the user to input the phone number and message.
// 4. When the user presses the "Send Message" button, the app retrieves the input values.
// 5. The WhatsAppSender.sendMessage function is called with the phone number and message, opening WhatsApp with the pre-filled message ready to send.
```
