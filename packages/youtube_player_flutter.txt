# Tutorial: Setting Up youtube_player_flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `youtube_player_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `youtube_player_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  youtube_player_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/youtube_player_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 16:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 16
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key to allow for YouTube video playback:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a YouTube player.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:youtube_player_flutter/youtube_player_flutter.dart';
   ```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the player:

   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
   }

   class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
     late YoutubePlayerController _controller;

     @override
     void initState() {
       super.initState();
       _controller = YoutubePlayerController(
         initialVideoId: 'dQw4w9WgXcQ', // Replace with your video ID
         flags: YoutubePlayerFlags(
           autoPlay: true,
           mute: false,
         ),
       );
     }

     @override
     void dispose() {
       _controller.dispose();
       super.dispose();
     }

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(
           title: Text('YouTube Player Example'),
         ),
         body: Column(
           children: [
             YoutubePlayer(
               controller: _controller,
               showVideoProgressIndicator: true,
             ),
           ],
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

This code sets up a basic YouTube player that plays a video automatically when the app starts. The player is embedded within a `Scaffold` widget, which provides a basic app structure.

Now you can run your application, and you should see the YouTube video playing within your Flutter app!

# Complete Example of youtube_player_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:youtube_player_flutter/youtube_player_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'YouTube Player Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late YoutubePlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the YoutubePlayerController with a video ID
    _controller = YoutubePlayerController(
      initialVideoId: 'dQw4w9WgXcQ', // Replace with your video ID
      flags: YoutubePlayerFlags(
        autoPlay: true, // Automatically play the video
        mute: false, // Start with sound on
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('YouTube Player Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Embed the YoutubePlayer widget
          YoutubePlayer(
            controller: _controller,
            showVideoProgressIndicator: true, // Show progress indicator
          ),
          // Additional UI elements can be added here
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a stateful widget.
// 3. In the initState method, the YoutubePlayerController is initialized with a video ID.
// 4. The YoutubePlayer widget is embedded in the Scaffold's body, displaying the video.
// 5. The controller is disposed of when the widget is removed to free up resources.
```
