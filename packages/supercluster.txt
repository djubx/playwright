# Supercluster Flutter Package

The **supercluster** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement clustering for large sets of geographical data points on maps. It is particularly useful in applications that require the visualization of numerous markers, such as location-based services, real estate apps, or any application that displays a large number of points of interest.

## When to Use Supercluster
- **Map Visualizations**: When you need to display a large number of markers on a map without overwhelming the user.
- **Data Density**: When your data points are densely packed in certain areas, clustering helps in providing a clearer view.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces the rendering load by grouping markers, which can significantly improve performance.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Clustering**: Automatically clusters markers based on zoom level and proximity.
- **Customizable Clusters**: Allows customization of cluster appearance and behavior.
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized for performance, ensuring smooth interactions even with large datasets.
- **Integration with Flutter Maps**: Works seamlessly with popular mapping packages like `google_maps_flutter` and `flutter_map`.

The supercluster package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their map-based applications with efficient and visually appealing clustering of data points.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Supercluster

## Installation
To get started with the supercluster package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  supercluster: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` has the necessary permissions for internet access and location services:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby points of interest.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby points of interest.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the supercluster package in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the Package**:
   ```dart
   import 'package:supercluster/supercluster.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize the Supercluster**:
   Create an instance of the `Supercluster` class and provide your data points.

3. **Update Clusters**:
   Call the method to update clusters whenever the map is zoomed or panned.

4. **Render Clusters**:
   Use the clusters to render on your map widget.

This setup will allow you to effectively manage and display clustered data points on your map.

# Complete Example of Using Supercluster

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_maps_flutter/google_maps_flutter.dart';
import 'package:supercluster/supercluster.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late GoogleMapController mapController; // Controller for Google Map
  late Supercluster supercluster; // Instance of Supercluster
  List<Marker> markers = []; // List to hold markers
  List<LatLng> points = []; // List of geographical points

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the list of points (latitude and longitude)
    points = [
      LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194), // Example point 1
      LatLng(37.7849, -122.4094), // Example point 2
      // Add more points as needed
    ];
    // Initialize the Supercluster with the points
    supercluster = Supercluster(points: points);
  }

  void _onMapCreated(GoogleMapController controller) {
    mapController = controller; // Assign the map controller
    _updateClusters(); // Update clusters when the map is created
  }

  void _updateClusters() {
    // Update clusters based on the current zoom level and map bounds
    supercluster.updateClusters(mapController.cameraPosition.target, mapController.cameraPosition.zoom);
    setState(() {
      markers = supercluster.getMarkers(); // Get the updated markers
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Supercluster Example')),
        body: GoogleMap(
          onMapCreated: _onMapCreated, // Callback when the map is created
          onCameraMove: (position) => _updateClusters(), // Update clusters on camera move
          initialCameraPosition: CameraPosition(
            target: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194), // Initial position
            zoom: 10, // Initial zoom level
          ),
          markers: Set<Marker>.of(markers), // Set of markers to display
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize the Google Map and Supercluster instances.
// 3. The _onMapCreated method is called when the map is ready, where we set the map controller and update clusters.
// 4. The _updateClusters method is called to update the clusters based on the current camera position.
// 5. The Google Map widget displays the markers that are generated by the Supercluster instance.
// 6. As the user moves the camera, the onCameraMove callback triggers the _updateClusters method to refresh the markers displayed on the map.
