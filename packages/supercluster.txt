// This code creates a basic Flutter app with a button that clusters points when pressed.
// The Supercluster instance is created in the `_MyHomePageState` class and used to cluster points when the button is pressed.
// The `clusters` stream is listened to and the clusters are printed to the console when received.
// In a real-world app, you would display the clusters on a map instead of printing them to the console.
