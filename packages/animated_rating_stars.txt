# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Animated Rating Stars

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `animated_rating_stars` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_rating_stars: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the `animated_rating_stars` widget in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_rating_stars/animated_rating_stars.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Rating Stars Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedRatingStars(
            starCount: 5, // Number of stars to display
            rating: 3.5, // Initial rating
            onRatingChanged: (rating) {
              // Handle rating change
              print('New rating: $rating');
            },
            starColor: Colors.amber, // Color of the stars
            starSize: 40.0, // Size of the stars
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application with an animated star rating widget in the center of the screen. The `onRatingChanged` callback allows you to handle user interactions with the stars.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully integrate the `animated_rating_stars` package into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Animated Rating Stars

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_rating_stars/animated_rating_stars.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Rating Stars Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Rating Stars Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: AnimatedRatingStars(
            starCount: 5, // Set the number of stars to display
            rating: 3.5, // Initial rating value
            onRatingChanged: (rating) {
              // This callback is triggered when the user changes the rating
              print('New rating: $rating'); // Log the new rating to the console
            },
            starColor: Colors.amber, // Set the color of the stars
            starSize: 40.0, // Set the size of the stars
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Animated Rating Stars Example".
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, we center the AnimatedRatingStars widget.
// 5. The AnimatedRatingStars widget is configured with 5 stars, an initial rating of 3.5, and a callback for when the rating changes.
// 6. When the user interacts with the stars, the onRatingChanged callback is triggered, logging the new rating to the console.
// 7. The stars are displayed in amber color and have a size of 40.0, providing a visually appealing rating interface.
