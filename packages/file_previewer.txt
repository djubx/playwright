# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the File Previewer Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **file_previewer** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  file_previewer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/file_previewer).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions to read files. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following key to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for accessing files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to preview files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents to preview files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the file previewer.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:file_previewer/file_previewer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'File Previewer Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: FilePreviewerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class FilePreviewerDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  // This method is called when the user taps the preview button
  void _previewFile(BuildContext context) {
    // Specify the file path and type
    String filePath = 'path/to/your/file.pdf'; // Change this to your file path
    String fileType = 'application/pdf'; // Change this to your file type

    // Use the FilePreviewer to show the file
    FilePreviewer.preview(
      context: context,
      filePath: filePath,
      fileType: fileType,
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('File Previewer Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => _previewFile(context), // Call the preview method
          child: Text('Preview File'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets FilePreviewerDemo as the home widget.
// 3. FilePreviewerDemo contains a button that, when pressed, calls the _previewFile method.
// 4. The _previewFile method specifies the file path and type, then calls FilePreviewer.preview to display the file.
// 5. The FilePreviewer handles the rendering of the file based on the provided path and type, allowing users to view it seamlessly.
```
