# Overview of the `touch_mouse_behavior` Flutter Package

The `touch_mouse_behavior` Flutter package is a versatile tool designed to enhance user interaction by distinguishing between touch and mouse input. This package is particularly useful in applications that run on multiple platforms, such as mobile devices and desktops, where the input method can significantly affect user experience.

## When to Use

- **Cross-Platform Applications**: If your Flutter app targets both mobile and desktop platforms, this package helps tailor the user interface and interactions based on the input method.
- **Custom Input Handling**: Applications that require different behaviors for touch and mouse inputs, such as custom gestures or UI changes, can benefit from this package.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: By recognizing the input type, developers can optimize the app's responsiveness and feedback, providing a more intuitive experience.

## Features

- **Input Detection**: Automatically detects whether the input is from a touch screen or a mouse.
- **Customizable Behavior**: Allows developers to define specific behaviors for touch and mouse inputs.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the `touch_mouse_behavior` Package

In this section, we'll walk through the setup process for the `touch_mouse_behavior` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     touch_mouse_behavior: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command to install the package.

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Import the Package**: Import the package in your Dart file where you plan to use it.

   ```dart
   import 'package:touch_mouse_behavior/touch_mouse_behavior.dart';
   ```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support all features of the package.

  ```gradle
  defaultConfig {
      minSdkVersion 21
  }
  ```

### iOS

- No specific configuration is required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`.

  ```ruby
  platform :ios, '9.0'
  ```

## Using the Package

To use the `touch_mouse_behavior` package, wrap your widgets with `TouchMouseRegion` and define the behavior for touch and mouse inputs.

```dart
TouchMouseRegion(
  onTouch: () {
    // Define touch behavior
  },
  onMouse: () {
    // Define mouse behavior
  },
  child: RealFlutter(),
)
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:touch_mouse_behavior/touch_mouse_behavior.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Touch Mouse Behavior Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Touch vs Mouse Input'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: TouchMouseRegion(
          onTouch: () {
            // This function is called when a touch input is detected
            print('Touch input detected');
          },
          onMouse: () {
            // This function is called when a mouse input is detected
            print('Mouse input detected');
          },
          child: Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 200,
            color: Colors.blue,
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Interact with me!',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The `MyApp` widget is the root of the application, setting up a `MaterialApp`.
// 2. `RealFlutter` is the main screen, displaying a simple UI with an AppBar and a centered container.
// 3. The `TouchMouseRegion` widget wraps the container, allowing it to detect touch and mouse inputs.
// 4. When the user interacts with the container, the appropriate callback (`onTouch` or `onMouse`) is triggered, printing a message to the console.
// 5. This setup allows the app to differentiate between touch and mouse inputs, providing a tailored response for each.
