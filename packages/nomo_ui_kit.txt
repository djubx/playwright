# Nomo UI Kit: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the Nomo UI Kit and explain how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the Nomo UI Kit to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  nomo_ui_kit: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21  // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the Nomo UI Kit package:

```dart
import 'package:nomo_ui_kit/nomo_ui_kit.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Nomo UI Kit Components

You can now start using the components provided by the Nomo UI Kit. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use a button and a card from the kit:

```dart
NomoButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  child: Text('Click Me'),
)

NomoCard(
  child: Text('This is a card!'),
)
```

With these steps, you are now ready to leverage the Nomo UI Kit in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Nomo UI Kit in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nomo_ui_kit/nomo_ui_kit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Nomo UI Kit Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Nomo UI Kit Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Using a NomoCard to display some information
            NomoCard(
              child: Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                child: Text(
                  'Welcome to the Nomo UI Kit Demo!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between elements
            // Using a NomoButton to trigger an action
            NomoButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action to be performed on button press
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Button Pressed'),
                    content: Text('You clicked the button!'),
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                        child: Text('Close'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Click Me'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. HomePage contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the NomoCard and NomoButton vertically.
// 6. The NomoCard displays a welcome message, while the NomoButton shows a dialog when pressed.
// 7. The dialog contains a title, message, and a button to close it, demonstrating interaction with the UI.
