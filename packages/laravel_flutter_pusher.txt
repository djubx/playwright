# Setting Up and Using Laravel Flutter Pusher

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `laravel_flutter_pusher` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To get started, add the `laravel_flutter_pusher` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  laravel_flutter_pusher: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following lines to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

To use the package, you need to initialize it with your Pusher credentials. Here’s how you can do that:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:laravel_flutter_pusher/laravel_flutter_pusher.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final Pusher pusher;

  RealFlutter()
      : pusher = Pusher(
          appKey: 'YOUR_PUSHER_APP_KEY',
          cluster: 'YOUR_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER',
          authEndpoint: 'YOUR_LARAVEL_AUTH_ENDPOINT',
        );

  void init() {
    pusher.connect();
    pusher.subscribe('my-channel').then((channel) {
      channel.bind('my-event', (data) {
        print('Received data: $data');
      });
    });
  }
}
```

In this example, replace `YOUR_PUSHER_APP_KEY`, `YOUR_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER`, and `YOUR_LARAVEL_AUTH_ENDPOINT` with your actual Pusher credentials and Laravel endpoint.

Now, you can call the `init()` method to establish a connection and start listening for events.

# Complete Example of Using Laravel Flutter Pusher

Here’s a complete Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `laravel_flutter_pusher` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:laravel_flutter_pusher/laravel_flutter_pusher.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Laravel Flutter Pusher Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  final RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();
  String message = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Pusher connection
    realFlutter.init();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pusher Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          message.isEmpty ? 'Waiting for messages...' : message,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The following comments explain the flow of the application:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and sets MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the message received.
// 4. In the initState method, we call realFlutter.init() to establish a connection to Pusher.
// 5. The build method displays the current message or a waiting message if none has been received.
// 6. When a message is received from the Pusher channel, it will update the state and display the message.
