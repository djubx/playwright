# Setting Up and Using the `banner_image` Package

## Installation

To get started with the `banner_image` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  banner_image: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/banner_image).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions for network access in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package

Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a banner image.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:banner_image/banner_image.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Banner Image Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: BannerImage(
            imageUrl: 'https://example.com/banner.jpg',
            aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
            alignment: Alignment.center,
            placeholder: CircularProgressIndicator(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a banner image with a loading indicator while the image is being fetched.

# Complete Example of Using `banner_image`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:banner_image/banner_image.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Banner Image Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using the BannerImage widget to display an image
          child: BannerImage(
            // URL of the image to be displayed
            imageUrl: 'https://example.com/banner.jpg',
            // Setting the aspect ratio for the image
            aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
            // Aligning the image to the center
            alignment: Alignment.center,
            // Placeholder widget while the image is loading
            placeholder: CircularProgressIndicator(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the overall structure of the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout, including an AppBar.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, the BannerImage widget is used to display an image.
// 6. The image is loaded from a specified URL, with a defined aspect ratio of 16:9.
// 7. The image is aligned to the center of the available space.
// 8. A CircularProgressIndicator is shown as a placeholder while the image is loading.
