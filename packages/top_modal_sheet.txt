# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Top Modal Sheet Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **top_modal_sheet** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  top_modal_sheet: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:top_modal_sheet/top_modal_sheet.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Top Modal Sheet
You can now use the `TopModalSheet` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to display a modal sheet when a button is pressed:

```dart
void showTopModalSheet(BuildContext context) {
  showTopModalSheet(
    context: context,
    builder: (context) {
      return Container(
        height: 300,
        color: Colors.white,
        child: Center(
          child: Text('Hello from the Top Modal Sheet!'),
        ),
      );
    },
  );
}
```

## Step 5: Dismissing the Modal Sheet
The modal sheet can be dismissed by swiping down or tapping outside of it. You can also programmatically dismiss it using the `Navigator.pop(context)` method.

With these steps, you are now ready to implement the **top_modal_sheet** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the Top Modal Sheet Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:top_modal_sheet/top_modal_sheet.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Top Modal Sheet Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Top Modal Sheet Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the top modal sheet when the button is pressed
            showTopModalSheet(context);
          },
          child: Text('Show Modal Sheet'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showTopModalSheet(BuildContext context) {
    // Display the top modal sheet
    showTopModalSheet(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return Container(
          height: 300, // Set the height of the modal sheet
          color: Colors.white, // Background color of the modal sheet
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('Hello from the Top Modal Sheet!'), // Content of the modal sheet
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Dismiss the modal sheet when the button is pressed
                  Navigator.pop(context);
                },
                child: Text('Close'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, containing a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the showTopModalSheet function is called.
// 4. This function uses the showTopModalSheet method to display the modal sheet.
// 5. The modal sheet contains a message and a button to close it.
// 6. Pressing the close button dismisses the modal sheet using Navigator.pop(context).
```

### Summary of the Code Flow
The application begins with the `MyApp` class, which initializes the Flutter app. The `HomeScreen` widget is displayed, featuring a button that, when pressed, triggers the `showTopModalSheet` function. This function utilizes the `showTopModalSheet` method to present the modal sheet, which contains a message and a button to close it. The modal sheet can be dismissed either by pressing the close button or by swiping down, providing a seamless user experience.
