# Tutorial: Setting Up the Transparent Image Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `transparent_image` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  transparent_image: ^2.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `TransparentImage` widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:transparent_image/transparent_image.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Transparent Image Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FadeInImage(
            placeholder: MemoryImage(kTransparentImage),
            image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image.png'),
            fit: BoxFit.cover,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, the `FadeInImage` widget is used to display a transparent placeholder while the actual image is loading from the network.

# Complete Example of Using the Transparent Image Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:transparent_image/transparent_image.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Transparent Image Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using FadeInImage to show a placeholder while loading the image
          child: FadeInImage(
            // Placeholder image while the actual image is loading
            placeholder: MemoryImage(kTransparentImage),
            // Actual image to be loaded from the network
            image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image.png'),
            // Fit the image to cover the available space
            fit: BoxFit.cover,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // Entry point of the application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a FadeInImage widget is used to display an image.
// 4. The placeholder is set to a transparent image (kTransparentImage) while the actual image is being fetched from the network.
// 5. Once the image is loaded, it fades in, providing a smooth user experience.
```
