# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the SVG Drawing Animation Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `svg_drawing_animation` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  svg_drawing_animation: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/svg_drawing_animation).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of SVG files by adding the following to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:svg_drawing_animation/svg_drawing_animation.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `SvgDrawingAnimation` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:svg_drawing_animation/svg_drawing_animation.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('SVG Drawing Animation Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: SvgDrawingAnimation(
            svgPath: 'assets/your_svg_file.svg', // Path to your SVG file
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Animation duration
            strokeWidth: 2.0, // Width of the stroke
            color: Colors.blue, // Color of the stroke
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application that animates an SVG file over a duration of 2 seconds.

# Complete Example of SVG Drawing Animation

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:svg_drawing_animation/svg_drawing_animation.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('SVG Drawing Animation Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Center widget to align the SVG animation in the middle of the screen
          child: SvgDrawingAnimation(
            svgPath: 'assets/your_svg_file.svg', // Path to your SVG file
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Animation duration
            strokeWidth: 2.0, // Width of the stroke
            color: Colors.blue, // Color of the stroke
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget holds the SvgDrawingAnimation widget, which takes the SVG file path, animation duration, stroke width, and color as parameters.
// 6. When the app runs, the SVG animation will play for 2 seconds, drawing the SVG path in blue color with a stroke width of 2.0.
```
