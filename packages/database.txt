// This is the main entry point of the app.
// It creates a new database instance and a new table.
// It then runs the app with the database instance.

// The app has a text field to input a name and four buttons to insert, retrieve, update, and delete rows.
// Each button calls a corresponding function to perform the database operation.

// The insert function inserts a new row with the input name.
// The retrieve function retrieves all rows and prints them to the console.
// The update function updates the name of the row with id 1 to 'Jane Doe'.
// The delete function deletes the row with id 1.

// Note that this is a very basic example and does not include any error handling or security measures.
// In a real-world app, you would want to add these features to make your app more robust and secure.
