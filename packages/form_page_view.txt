# Setting Up and Using `form_page_view`

## Installation
To get started with the `form_page_view` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  form_page_view: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/form_page_view).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `form_page_view` package, you will typically create a `FormPageView` widget that contains multiple pages. Each page can have its own form fields and validation logic.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a multi-step form:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:form_page_view/form_page_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: FormPageView(
        pages: [
          // Define your form pages here
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the `pages` list, you can add your individual form pages, each represented as a widget.

# Complete Example of `form_page_view`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:form_page_view/form_page_view.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: FormPageView(
        pages: [
          // First page with name input
          FormPage(
            title: 'Personal Information',
            children: [
              TextFormField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Name'),
                validator: (value) {
                  if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
                    return 'Please enter your name';
                  }
                  return null;
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
          // Second page with email input
          FormPage(
            title: 'Contact Information',
            children: [
              TextFormField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
                validator: (value) {
                  if (value == null || !RegExp(r'^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+').hasMatch(value)) {
                    return 'Please enter a valid email';
                  }
                  return null;
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
          // Final page with confirmation
          FormPage(
            title: 'Confirmation',
            children: [
              Text('Please confirm your information.'),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle form submission
                },
                child: Text('Submit'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which initializes the MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a FormPageView is created with three pages.
// 3. The first page collects the user's name and validates the input.
// 4. The second page collects the user's email and validates it against a regex pattern.
// 5. The final page displays a confirmation message and a submit button.
// 6. When the user clicks the submit button, you can handle the form submission logic as needed.
