# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Native Video Player

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `native_video_player` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `native_video_player` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  native_video_player: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21  // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select videos.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple video player widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_video_player/native_video_player.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: VideoPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoPlayerScreenState createState() => _VideoPlayerScreenState();
}

class _VideoPlayerScreenState extends State<VideoPlayerScreen> {
  late NativeVideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the video player controller with a video URL
    _controller = NativeVideoPlayerController.network(
      'https://www.example.com/video.mp4',
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Native Video Player')),
      body: Center(
        child: NativeVideoPlayer(
          controller: _controller,
          aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
          // Add additional parameters as needed
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple video player that plays a video from a network URL. The `NativeVideoPlayer` widget takes a controller that manages the video playback.

# Complete Example of Native Video Player

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_video_player/native_video_player.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: VideoPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoPlayerScreenState createState() => _VideoPlayerScreenState();
}

class _VideoPlayerScreenState extends State<VideoPlayerScreen> {
  late NativeVideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the video player controller with a video URL
    _controller = NativeVideoPlayerController.network(
      'https://www.example.com/video.mp4', // Replace with your video URL
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Native Video Player')),
      body: Center(
        child: NativeVideoPlayer(
          controller: _controller,
          aspectRatio: 16 / 9, // Set the aspect ratio for the video
          // Add additional parameters as needed
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The VideoPlayerScreen widget is created, which manages the video playback.
// 3. In the initState method, we initialize the NativeVideoPlayerController with a video URL.
// 4. The controller is disposed of in the dispose method to free up resources.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a NativeVideoPlayer widget.
// 6. The NativeVideoPlayer widget takes the controller and displays the video with the specified aspect ratio.
