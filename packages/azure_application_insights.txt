<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Azure Application Insights Flutter Package

The `azure_application_insights` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to integrate Azure Application Insights into their Flutter applications. This package provides a way to monitor application performance, track user behavior, and diagnose issues in real-time. By leveraging Azure's robust analytics capabilities, developers can gain insights into how their applications are being used and identify areas for improvement.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `azure_application_insights` package in scenarios such as:

- **Performance Monitoring**: To track the performance of your application and identify bottlenecks.
- **Error Tracking**: To log exceptions and errors that occur in your application, allowing for quicker diagnosis and resolution.
- **User Behavior Analysis**: To understand how users interact with your application, which features are most popular, and where users may be experiencing difficulties.

## Features

- **Automatic Telemetry**: Automatically collects telemetry data such as requests, exceptions, and performance metrics.
- **Custom Events**: Allows you to log custom events and metrics to track specific user actions or application states.
- **User Tracking**: Provides insights into user sessions and engagement.
- **Integration with Azure**: Seamlessly integrates with Azure Application Insights for powerful analytics and reporting.

By using this package, developers can ensure their applications are not only functional but also optimized for user experience and performance.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Azure Application Insights in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `azure_application_insights` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `azure_application_insights` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  azure_application_insights: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/azure_application_insights).

## Step 2: Configure for Android

For Android, you need to ensure that the Internet permission is set in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

This allows your app to make network requests to Azure Application Insights.

## Step 4: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, you need to initialize the `azure_application_insights` package. Here’s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:azure_application_insights/azure_application_insights.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Azure Application Insights with your instrumentation key
  AzureApplicationInsights.initialize('YOUR_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY');
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

Replace `YOUR_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY` with your actual Azure Application Insights instrumentation key.

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the package to log events, track exceptions, and monitor performance. Here’s a simple example of logging a custom event:

```dart
AzureApplicationInsights.trackEvent('MyCustomEvent', properties: {'key': 'value'});
```

This will log a custom event to Azure Application Insights with the specified properties.

With these steps, you have successfully set up the `azure_application_insights` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Azure Application Insights in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:azure_application_insights/azure_application_insights.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Azure Application Insights with your instrumentation key
  AzureApplicationInsights.initialize('YOUR_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY');
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Azure Application Insights Demo',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Azure Application Insights Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Log a custom event when the button is pressed
            AzureApplicationInsights.trackEvent('ButtonPressed', properties: {'button': 'DemoButton'});
            // Simulate an error for demonstration
            try {
              throw Exception('This is a simulated error');
            } catch (e) {
              // Log the exception to Azure Application Insights
              AzureApplicationInsights.trackException(e);
            }
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts by initializing Azure Application Insights with the provided instrumentation key.
// 2. The main widget, RealFlutter, is created, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. The home page, MyHomePage, is displayed with a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a custom event 'ButtonPressed' is logged to Azure Application Insights.
// 5. An exception is simulated, and the error is caught and logged to Azure Application Insights as well.
// 6. This allows developers to monitor user interactions and errors in real-time.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we have created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the `azure_application_insights` package. The application initializes the package, logs a custom event when a button is pressed, and simulates an error to demonstrate error tracking.

### Summary of Application Flow

- The application initializes Azure Application Insights with the instrumentation key.
- The main widget sets up the MaterialApp and displays a home page with a button.
- When the button is pressed, a custom event is logged, and an exception is simulated and logged.
- This flow allows developers to track user interactions and errors effectively, providing valuable insights into application performance and user behavior.
