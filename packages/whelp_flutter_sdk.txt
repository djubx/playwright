void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Whelp SDK Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Whelp SDK
    Whelp.initialize(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Whelp SDK Demo')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to chat screen
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => ChatScreen()),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Start Chat'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Chat')),
      body: WhelpChatWidget(), // Whelp's chat widget
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the Whelp SDK with an API key and provide a simple interface to start a chat.
