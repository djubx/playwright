# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Animation Transition

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **simple_animation_transition** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_animation_transition: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a transition using the **simple_animation_transition** package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_animation_transition/simple_animation_transition.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to track the current state
  bool _isFirstScreen = true;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Simple Animation Transition Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Using SimpleAnimationTransition to animate between two screens
          child: SimpleAnimationTransition(
            // The child widget to animate
            child: _isFirstScreen ? FirstScreen() : SecondScreen(),
            // Duration of the transition
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
            // Animation curve
            curve: Curves.easeInOut,
            // Callback to trigger when the animation completes
            onEnd: () {
              // Toggle the screen state
              setState(() {
                _isFirstScreen = !_isFirstScreen;
              });
            },
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          // Button to trigger the transition
          onPressed: () {
            // Trigger the animation by calling setState
            setState(() {
              _isFirstScreen = !_isFirstScreen;
            });
          },
          child: Icon(Icons.swap_horiz),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// First screen widget
class FirstScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      color: Colors.blue,
      child: Center(
        child: Text(
          'First Screen',
          style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Second screen widget
class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      color: Colors.green,
      child: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Second Screen',
          style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the current screen.
// 3. The `_isFirstScreen` boolean variable determines which screen to display.
// 4. In the `build` method, a `SimpleAnimationTransition` widget is used to animate between `FirstScreen` and `SecondScreen`.
// 5. The `duration` and `curve` properties define the animation's duration and easing curve.
// 6. The `onEnd` callback is triggered when the animation completes, allowing the state to toggle between screens.
// 7. A `FloatingActionButton` is provided to manually trigger the transition by toggling the `_isFirstScreen` variable.
// 8. The `FirstScreen` and `SecondScreen` widgets display different content and colors, providing a clear visual distinction during the transition.
