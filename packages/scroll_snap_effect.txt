# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Scroll Snap Effect

## Installation
To use the `scroll_snap_effect` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scroll_snap_effect: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/scroll_snap_effect).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To implement the scroll snap effect, you can use the `ScrollSnapEffect` widget provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:scroll_snap_effect/scroll_snap_effect.dart';
```

2. Use the `ScrollSnapEffect` widget in your widget tree:

```dart
ScrollSnapEffect(
  itemCount: 10, // Number of items to display
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return Container(
      width: 200,
      height: 200,
      color: Colors.blue,
      child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
    );
  },
)
```

This will create a scrollable list of 10 items that snap into place as you scroll.

With this setup, you are ready to start using the `scroll_snap_effect` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Scroll Snap Effect

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scroll_snap_effect/scroll_snap_effect.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scroll Snap Effect Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Scroll Snap Effect'),
        ),
        body: ScrollSnapEffect(
          itemCount: 10, // Total number of items
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            // Building each item in the scrollable list
            return Container(
              width: 200, // Width of each item
              height: 200, // Height of each item
              color: Colors.blue, // Background color of each item
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Item $index', // Displaying item index
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Scroll Snap Effect'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold uses the ScrollSnapEffect widget to create a scrollable list.
// 5. The itemCount is set to 10, meaning there will be 10 items in the list.
// 6. The itemBuilder function constructs each item, which is a blue container with the item index displayed in the center.
// 7. As the user scrolls through the items, they will snap into place, providing a smooth and engaging experience.
