# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Ticker Text

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with the **ticker_text** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ticker_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:ticker_text/ticker_text.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Ticker Text Widget
You can now use the `TickerText` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
TickerText(
  'This is a scrolling text example!',
  speed: Duration(milliseconds: 100), // Speed of the scrolling
  textStyle: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 20,
    color: Colors.blue,
    fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
  ),
  repeat: true, // Set to true for infinite scrolling
)
```

This widget will display the text "This is a scrolling text example!" scrolling across the screen.

# Complete Example of Ticker Text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ticker_text/ticker_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ticker Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Ticker Text Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TickerText(
            'Welcome to the Ticker Text Demo! Enjoy scrolling text effects.',
            speed: Duration(milliseconds: 100), // Speed of the scrolling text
            textStyle: TextStyle(
              fontSize: 24, // Font size of the text
              color: Colors.green, // Color of the text
              fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, // Font weight
            ),
            repeat: true, // Enable infinite scrolling
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Ticker Text Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers the TickerText widget.
// 5. The TickerText widget displays a scrolling message with specified speed, style, and infinite repeat.
// 6. The text scrolls across the screen, providing a dynamic and engaging user experience.
