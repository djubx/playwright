# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Algolia Insights in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **algolia_insights** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **algolia_insights** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  algolia_insights: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure for Android

For Android, ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application
        android:label="Your App"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        <!-- Other configurations -->
    </application>

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
</manifest>
```

## Step 3: Configure for iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following to your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Initialize Algolia Insights

In your main application file, initialize the Algolia Insights client. You will need your Algolia Application ID and API Key.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:algolia_insights/algolia_insights.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Algolia Insights Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  late AlgoliaInsights insights;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Algolia Insights with your Application ID and API Key
    insights = AlgoliaInsights(
      applicationID: 'YourApplicationID',
      apiKey: 'YourAPIKey',
    );
  }

  // Additional methods to track events will go here
}
```

## Step 5: Track User Interactions

You can now track user interactions with search results. For example, when a user clicks on a search result, you can log that event:

```dart
void trackClick(String objectID) {
  insights.trackClick(
    eventName: 'result_click',
    objectID: objectID,
    indexName: 'your_index_name',
  );
}
```

This method can be called whenever a user interacts with a search result.

# Complete Example: Algolia Insights in Action

Hereâ€™s a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the **algolia_insights** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:algolia_insights/algolia_insights.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Algolia Insights Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  late AlgoliaInsights insights;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Algolia Insights with your Application ID and API Key
    insights = AlgoliaInsights(
      applicationID: 'YourApplicationID',
      apiKey: 'YourAPIKey',
    );
  }

  // Method to track user clicks on search results
  void trackClick(String objectID) {
    insights.trackClick(
      eventName: 'result_click',
      objectID: objectID,
      indexName: 'your_index_name',
    );
  }

  // Sample search results
  final List<String> searchResults = [
    'Result 1',
    'Result 2',
    'Result 3',
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Algolia Insights Demo'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: searchResults.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(searchResults[index]),
            onTap: () {
              // Track the click event when a result is tapped
              trackClick('objectID_$index');
              // Navigate to a detail page or perform another action
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Clicked on ${searchResults[index]}')),
              );
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, where Algolia Insights is initialized with the application ID and API key.
// 3. A list of sample search results is displayed using a ListView.
// 4. When a user taps on a search result, the trackClick method is called, logging the click event to Algolia Insights.
// 5. A SnackBar is shown to provide feedback to the user about their action.
```
