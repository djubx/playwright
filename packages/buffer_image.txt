// The RealFlutter class creates a Scaffold with a single child, a Column.
// The Column contains three BufferImage widgets, each loading an image from a different source.
// The first BufferImage widget loads an image from a URL, caching the image for better performance.
// The second BufferImage widget loads an image from an asset, resizing the image to 100x100 pixels.
// The third BufferImage widget loads an image from a file, rotating the image 90 degrees.

// The BufferImage widget is used to load and display images in a efficient and optimized way.
// The cache parameter is used to cache the image, improving performance and reducing memory usage.
// The width and height parameters are used to resize the image, while the rotation parameter is used to rotate the image.
