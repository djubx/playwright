# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Cupertino TabBar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `cupertino_tabbar` package in a Flutter application and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `cupertino_tabbar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_tabbar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the `cupertino_tabbar`, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:cupertino_tabbar/cupertino_tabbar.dart';
```

## Step 3: Basic Configuration

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that your app's deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Cupertino TabBar

Now that we have set up the package, we can create a simple application using the `CupertinoTabBar`. Below is an example of how to implement it in your Flutter app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cupertino_tabbar/cupertino_tabbar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CupertinoApp(
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  // Variable to keep track of the selected tab index
  int _selectedIndex = 0;

  // List of widgets to display for each tab
  final List<Widget> _widgetOptions = <Widget>[
    Center(child: Text('Home')),
    Center(child: Text('Search')),
    Center(child: Text('Profile')),
  ];

  // Method to handle tab selection
  void _onItemTapped(int index) {
    setState(() {
      _selectedIndex = index; // Update the selected index
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CupertinoPageScaffold(
      navigationBar: CupertinoNavigationBar(
        middle: Text('Cupertino TabBar Example'),
      ),
      child: Column(
        children: <Widget>[
          Expanded(
            child: _widgetOptions.elementAt(_selectedIndex), // Display the selected tab's widget
          ),
          CupertinoTabBar(
            items: const <BottomNavigationBarItem>[
              BottomNavigationBarItem(
                icon: Icon(CupertinoIcons.home),
                label: 'Home',
              ),
              BottomNavigationBarItem(
                icon: Icon(CupertinoIcons.search),
                label: 'Search',
              ),
              BottomNavigationBarItem(
                icon: Icon(CupertinoIcons.person),
                label: 'Profile',
              ),
            ],
            currentIndex: _selectedIndex, // Set the current index
            onTap: _onItemTapped, // Handle tab selection
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a CupertinoApp with MyHomePage as the home.
// 3. MyHomePage is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected tab index.
// 4. The _widgetOptions list contains the widgets to display for each tab.
// 5. The _onItemTapped method updates the selected index when a tab is tapped.
// 6. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the selected widget and the CupertinoTabBar.
// 7. The CupertinoTabBar allows users to switch between Home, Search, and Profile tabs seamlessly.
