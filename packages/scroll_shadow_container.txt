# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using scroll_shadow_container

## Installation
To use the `scroll_shadow_container` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scroll_shadow_container: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/scroll_shadow_container).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Basic Usage
To use the `scroll_shadow_container`, you can wrap your scrollable widget (like `ListView` or `GridView`) with the `ScrollShadowContainer` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scroll_shadow_container/scroll_shadow_container.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Scroll Shadow Container Example')),
      body: ScrollShadowContainer(
        shadowColor: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5),
        shadowBlurRadius: 10.0,
        shadowOffset: Offset(0, 4),
        child: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 20,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text('Item $index'),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a `ListView` wrapped in a `ScrollShadowContainer`, applying a shadow effect to the list.

Now you are ready to use the `scroll_shadow_container` package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of scroll_shadow_container

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scroll_shadow_container/scroll_shadow_container.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scroll Shadow Container Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Scroll Shadow Container Example')),
        body: ScrollShadowContainer(
          // Setting the shadow color to a semi-transparent black
          shadowColor: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5),
          // Defining the blur radius of the shadow
          shadowBlurRadius: 10.0,
          // Setting the offset of the shadow
          shadowOffset: Offset(0, 4),
          child: ListView.builder(
            // Building a list of 20 items
            itemCount: 20,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'), // Displaying item index
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of a ScrollShadowContainer that wraps a ListView.
// 5. The ScrollShadowContainer applies a shadow effect to the ListView.
// 6. The ListView.builder creates a scrollable list of 20 items.
// 7. Each item in the list is represented by a ListTile displaying its index.
