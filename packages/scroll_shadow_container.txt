// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a scrolling list of items.
// 2. As the user scrolls the list, a shadow appears at the top or bottom of the screen, indicating the content is scrollable.
// 3. The shadow appearance is customized using the `shadowColor`, `shadowOpacity`, `shadowRadius`, and `shadowOffset` properties.
// 4. The scrolling content is wrapped in a `ScrollShadowContainer` widget, which provides the scrolling effect and shadow appearance.
// 5. The `ScrollShadowContainer` widget is compatible with both Android and iOS platforms, and can be adjusted to match platform-specific design guidelines.
