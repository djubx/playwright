# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Metadata God

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **metadata_god** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  metadata_god: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to read files. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for accessing the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to retrieve metadata.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to capture images.</string>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve metadata from an image file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:metadata_god/metadata_god.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Metadata God Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Replace with your image file path
              String filePath = 'path/to/your/image.jpg';
              Metadata metadata = await MetadataGod.getMetadata(filePath);
              print(metadata);
            },
            child: Text('Get Metadata'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that retrieves metadata from an image file when a button is pressed.

# Complete Example of Metadata God

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:metadata_god/metadata_god.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Metadata God Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the path to the image file
              String filePath = 'path/to/your/image.jpg';
              
              // Retrieve metadata from the specified file
              Metadata metadata = await MetadataGod.getMetadata(filePath);
              
              // Display the metadata in a dialog
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) {
                  return AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Metadata'),
                    content: Text(metadata.toString()), // Display metadata as string
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                        child: Text('Close'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  );
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Get Metadata'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. The file path of the image is defined, and the getMetadata method is called to retrieve the metadata.
// 6. Once the metadata is retrieved, an AlertDialog is displayed showing the metadata information.
// 7. The user can close the dialog by pressing the 'Close' button.
```
