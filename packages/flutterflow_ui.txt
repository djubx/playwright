# Setting Up and Using FlutterFlow UI

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the **flutterflow_ui** package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter applications.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **flutterflow_ui** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutterflow_ui: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutterflow_ui).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using its features:

```dart
import 'package:flutterflow_ui/flutterflow_ui.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using FlutterFlow UI Widgets

You can now start using the widgets provided by the **flutterflow_ui** package. For example, you can create a simple button using the `FFButton` widget:

```dart
FFButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  text: 'Click Me',
);
```

This button can be customized with various properties such as color, size, and shape.

By following these steps, you can successfully set up and start using the **flutterflow_ui** package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of FlutterFlow UI

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the **flutterflow_ui** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutterflow_ui/flutterflow_ui.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'FlutterFlow UI Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('FlutterFlow UI Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: FFButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action to perform when the button is pressed
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                title: Text('Hello!'),
                content: Text('You clicked the button!'),
                actions: [
                  TextButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                    },
                    child: Text('Close'),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            );
          },
          text: 'Click Me',
          options: FFButtonOptions(
            width: 150,
            height: 50,
            color: Colors.blue,
            textStyle: TextStyle(
              color: Colors.white,
              fontSize: 18,
            ),
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 4. HomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, an FFButton is created.
// 6. When the button is pressed, a dialog is shown with a message.
// 7. The dialog contains a close button that dismisses the dialog when pressed.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

## Summary of Application Flow

The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget. This widget sets up a `MaterialApp` with a title and theme. The home page is defined by the `HomePage` widget, which contains a simple UI with an AppBar and a centered button. When the button is clicked, an alert dialog appears, demonstrating the interaction capabilities of the **flutterflow_ui** package. The dialog can be dismissed by pressing the close button, showcasing a basic user interaction flow.

By following this structure, you can effectively utilize the **flutterflow_ui** package to create beautiful and functional Flutter applications.
