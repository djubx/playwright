# flutter_loggy: A Comprehensive Logging Package for Flutter

## Overview

The `flutter_loggy` package is a powerful logging tool designed for Flutter applications. It provides a flexible and extensible logging framework that allows developers to log messages in a structured way, making it easier to debug and monitor applications. With `flutter_loggy`, you can log messages at different levels (info, debug, error, etc.), customize log outputs, and even send logs to external services.

### When to Use `flutter_loggy`

- **Debugging**: When developing applications, logging is essential for tracking down issues and understanding application flow.
- **Monitoring**: In production, logging helps monitor application performance and user interactions.
- **Analytics**: You can log user actions to analyze behavior and improve user experience.

### Features

- **Custom Log Levels**: Define your own log levels to categorize messages.
- **Log Formatting**: Customize how logs are formatted and displayed.
- **Multiple Outputs**: Send logs to different outputs, such as console, files, or remote servers.
- **Integration**: Easily integrate with existing Flutter applications.

## Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_loggy`

### Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `flutter_loggy`, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_loggy: ^0.5.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_loggy/flutter_loggy.dart';
```

### Step 3: Initializing Loggy

You need to initialize Loggy in your main application file. Here’s how to do it:

```dart
void main() {
  Loggy.initLoggy();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### Step 4: Using Loggy in Your Application

You can now use Loggy to log messages throughout your application. Here’s an example of how to log messages at different levels:

```dart
Loggy.info('This is an info message');
Loggy.warning('This is a warning message');
Loggy.error('This is an error message');
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if you plan to log to external files or services. You may need to add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your app's Info.plist to allow logging to external services or files. Ensure you have the appropriate permissions set.

### Step 5: Customizing Log Outputs

You can customize where your logs go. For example, to log to a file, you can set up a file logger:

```dart
final fileLogger = FileLoggy('logs/app.log');
Loggy.initLoggy(logPrinter: fileLogger);
```

This will direct all logs to the specified file.

### Step 6: Advanced Configuration

For advanced users, `flutter_loggy` allows you to create custom loggers and formatters. You can extend the base classes to create your own logging behavior.

```dart
class MyCustomLogger extends Loggy {
  @override
  void log(LogLevel level, String message) {
    // Custom logging behavior
  }
}
```

Now you can use `MyCustomLogger` in your application.

## Complete Example: A Flutter Application Using `flutter_loggy`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_loggy/flutter_loggy.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Loggy for logging
  Loggy.initLoggy();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Loggy Example',
      home: LoggyExampleScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class LoggyExampleScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LoggyExampleScreenState createState() => _LoggyExampleScreenState();
}

class _LoggyExampleScreenState extends State<LoggyExampleScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Log an info message when the screen is initialized
    Loggy.info('LoggyExampleScreen initialized');
  }

  void _logMessage() {
    // Log a button press event
    Loggy.info('Button pressed!');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Loggy Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            _logMessage(); // Call the log message function
          },
          child: Text('Press me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes Loggy and runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. LoggyExampleScreen is created, and an info log is generated in initState.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _logMessage function is called, logging another info message.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

### Summary of Application Flow

- The application starts by initializing the `flutter_loggy` package in the `main` function.
- The `MyApp` widget is created, which sets up the main structure of the app.
- The `LoggyExampleScreen` widget logs an initialization message when it is created.
- When the user presses the button, another log message is generated, demonstrating how to log user interactions.

This structured approach to logging with `flutter_loggy` enhances the debugging and monitoring capabilities of your Flutter applications, making it a valuable tool for developers.
