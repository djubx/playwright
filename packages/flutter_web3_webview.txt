  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_web3_webview: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add internet permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Using the Package

To use the `flutter_web3_webview` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

# Complete Example of flutter_web3_webview

Here is a complete example of a Flutter application using the `flutter_web3_webview` package. This example demonstrates how to set up a web view that connects to a Web3 provider.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_web3_webview/flutter_web3_webview.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Web3 WebView Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Web3HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class Web3HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _Web3HomePageState createState() => _Web3HomePageState();
}

class _Web3HomePageState extends State<Web3HomePage> {
  // URL of the dApp to be displayed
  final String dAppUrl = 'https://your-dapp-url.com';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Web3 WebView Example'),
      ),
      body: Web3WebView(
        // The URL of the dApp
        url: dAppUrl,
        // Callback for when the web view is loaded
        onWebViewCreated: (controller) {
          print('WebView created');
        },
        // Callback for when the page finishes loading
        onPageFinished: (url) {
          print('Page finished loading: $url');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home page is set to Web3HomePage.
// 4. Web3HomePage creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a Web3WebView that loads the specified dApp URL.
// 6. Callbacks are provided to handle events like web view creation and page loading completion.
