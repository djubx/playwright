# Speed Up Flutter Package
================================

The `speed_up` Flutter package is designed to optimize the performance of Flutter applications by reducing the time it takes to perform various tasks. It provides a set of tools and utilities that can be used to improve the overall speed and efficiency of Flutter apps.

## When to Use
--------------

The `speed_up` package is particularly useful when:

* You need to perform complex computations or data processing in your app.
* You want to improve the responsiveness of your app's UI.
* You need to optimize the performance of your app's database or network operations.

## Features
------------

The `speed_up` package provides the following features:

* **Async task management**: allows you to run tasks in the background, improving the responsiveness of your app's UI.
* **Caching**: provides a simple caching mechanism to reduce the number of database or network queries.
* **Optimized database operations**: provides optimized database operations to reduce the time it takes to perform CRUD operations.

# Setting Up the Speed Up Package
================================

To use the `speed_up` package in your Flutter app, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec File

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  speed_up: ^1.0.0
```
### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:speed_up/speed_up.dart';
```
### Step 3: Initialize the Package

Initialize the package in your app's `main` function:
```dart
void main() {
  SpeedUp.init();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```
### Platform-Specific Configurations

#### Android

To use the `speed_up` package on Android, you need to add the following configuration to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<application
    ...
    android:largeHeap="true"
    ...>
</application>
```
#### iOS

To use the `speed_up` package on iOS, you need to add the following configuration to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:speed_up/speed_up.dart';

void main() {
  SpeedUp.init();
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the SpeedUp package
  final SpeedUp _speedUp = SpeedUp();

  // Define a complex computation task
  Future<int> _computeTask() async {
    // Simulate a complex computation task
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
    return 42;
  }

  // Define a caching mechanism
  Future<int> _getCachedResult() async {
    // Check if the result is cached
    if (_speedUp.isCached('result')) {
      // Return the cached result
      return _speedUp.getCached('result');
    } else {
      // Compute the result and cache it
      final result = await _computeTask();
      _speedUp.cache('result', result);
      return result;
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Speed Up Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder(
            future: _getCachedResult(),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.hasData) {
                return Text('Result: ${snapshot.data}');
              } else {
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The SpeedUp package is initialized in the main function.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created and rendered.
// 3. The _getCachedResult function is called to retrieve the cached result.
// 4. If the result is cached, it is returned immediately.
// 5. If the result is not cached, the _computeTask function is called to compute the result.
// 6. The result is then cached using the SpeedUp package.
// 7. The cached result is returned to the FutureBuilder.
// 8. The FutureBuilder renders the result to the screen.

// In summary, the SpeedUp package is used to cache the result of a complex computation task,
// allowing the application to render the result immediately instead of waiting for the computation to complete.
