# Complete Example of Dotted Separator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dotted_separator/dotted_separator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dotted Separator Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dotted Separator Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Section 1'),
              // Adding a dotted separator between sections
              DottedSeparator(
                color: Colors.blue,
                dashLength: 8.0,
                dashThickness: 2.0,
                dashSpace: 4.0,
                direction: Axis.horizontal,
              ),
              Text('Section 2'),
              // Another dotted separator
              DottedSeparator(
                color: Colors.red,
                dashLength: 10.0,
                dashThickness: 3.0,
                dashSpace: 5.0,
                direction: Axis.horizontal,
              ),
              Text('Section 3'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the text and separators vertically.
// 5. Each section of text is separated by a DottedSeparator widget, which visually distinguishes the sections.
// 6. The properties of DottedSeparator can be customized for different appearances.
```
