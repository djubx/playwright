# Tutorial: Setting Up Zego Zimkit in Your Flutter Application

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Zego Zimkit Flutter package and demonstrate how to use it in your application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the Zego Zimkit package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  zego_zimkit: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permissions for camera and microphone:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for voice calls.</string>
```

## Step 3: Initialize Zego Zimkit

In your main Dart file, initialize the Zego Zimkit SDK. You will need to provide your App ID and App Sign, which you can obtain from the Zego dashboard.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zego_zimkit/zego_zimkit.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  ZegoZimkit.init(appId: YOUR_APP_ID, appSign: YOUR_APP_SIGN);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using Zego Zimkit

You can now use the Zego Zimkit features in your application. For example, to create a simple chat interface, you can use the following code snippet:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: ChatScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Chat')),
      body: ZegoChatView(),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic chat screen using the Zego Zimkit chat view.

# Complete Example: A Functional Flutter Application Using Zego Zimkit

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zego_zimkit/zego_zimkit.dart';

void main() {
  // Ensure Flutter bindings are initialized before using any plugins
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize Zego Zimkit with your App ID and App Sign
  ZegoZimkit.init(appId: YOUR_APP_ID, appSign: YOUR_APP_SIGN);
  
  // Run the main application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Zego Zimkit Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: ChatScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Chat')),
      body: ZegoChatView(), // Display the chat view provided by Zego Zimkit
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter application and Zego Zimkit SDK.
// 2. The RealFlutter class sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to ChatScreen, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. The ChatScreen class builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body that contains the ZegoChatView.
// 5. The ZegoChatView widget handles all the chat functionalities, allowing users to send and receive messages in real-time.
```
