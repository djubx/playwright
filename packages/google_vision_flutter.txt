# Google Vision Flutter Package

The `google_vision_flutter` package is a powerful tool that allows Flutter developers to integrate Google Cloud Vision API capabilities into their applications. This package enables developers to perform image analysis tasks such as text recognition, face detection, label detection, and more, directly from their Flutter apps. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the `google_vision_flutter` package in scenarios such as:
- Building applications that require OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from images.
- Developing apps that need to identify and analyze faces in photos.
- Creating image processing applications that require object detection and labeling.

## Features
- **Text Recognition**: Extracts text from images, supporting multiple languages.
- **Face Detection**: Identifies faces in images and provides bounding boxes and facial landmarks.
- **Label Detection**: Recognizes objects and scenes in images, providing descriptive labels.
- **Barcode Detection**: Scans and decodes barcodes from images.

This package leverages the power of Google Cloud Vision API, making it a robust choice for developers looking to implement advanced image processing features in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Google Vision Flutter

## Installation
To get started with the `google_vision_flutter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_vision_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/google_vision_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

2. **Google Cloud Vision API Key**: You will need to set up a Google Cloud project and enable the Vision API. Obtain your API key and add it to your app's configuration.

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Add the following to your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for image analysis.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the photo library for image analysis.</string>
```

2. **Google Cloud Vision API Key**: Similar to Android, ensure you have your API key set up in your iOS project.

## Using the Package
Once you have completed the installation and configuration, you can start using the package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to use the `google_vision_flutter` package to perform text recognition.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_vision_flutter/google_vision_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Google Vision Example',
      home: VisionHome(),
    );
  }
}

class VisionHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VisionHomeState createState() => _VisionHomeState();
}

class _VisionHomeState extends State<VisionHome> {
  String _result = "Scan an image to see the result";

  // Function to perform text recognition
  Future<void> _performTextRecognition() async {
    // Use the image picker to select an image
    final image = await ImagePicker().getImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
    
    if (image != null) {
      // Call the Google Vision API for text recognition
      final result = await GoogleVision.detectText(image.path);
      
      // Update the state with the recognized text
      setState(() {
        _result = result.text; // Store the recognized text
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Google Vision Flutter'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_result), // Display the recognized text
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _performTextRecognition, // Trigger text recognition
              child: Text('Scan Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
```
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home page.
// The home page is VisionHome, a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the text recognition result.
// Inside VisionHome, we define a string _result to hold the recognized text.
// The _performTextRecognition function is called when the user presses the "Scan Image" button.
// This function uses the ImagePicker to allow the user to select an image from their gallery.
// Once an image is selected, it calls the Google Vision API to perform text recognition.
// The recognized text is then stored in the _result variable, which updates the UI to display the text.
// The UI consists of a Text widget to show the recognized text and a button to initiate the scanning process.
