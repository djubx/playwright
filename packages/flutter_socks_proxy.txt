# flutter_socks_proxy: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_socks_proxy` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement SOCKS proxy support in their applications. This package allows you to route your network requests through a SOCKS proxy server, which can be useful for various scenarios, such as enhancing privacy, bypassing geo-restrictions, or testing network behavior.

## When to Use `flutter_socks_proxy`
- **Privacy and Security**: If your application requires secure communication, using a SOCKS proxy can help mask the user's IP address.
- **Bypassing Restrictions**: For applications that need to access content restricted by geographical location, a SOCKS proxy can provide a workaround.
- **Network Testing**: Developers can simulate different network conditions and behaviors by routing requests through a proxy.

## Key Features
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API to set up and use SOCKS proxies in your Flutter applications.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Customizable**: Allows for various configurations to suit different use cases.

Overall, `flutter_socks_proxy` is an essential package for developers needing advanced network capabilities in their Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using `flutter_socks_proxy`

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_socks_proxy` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the `flutter_socks_proxy` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_socks_proxy: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_socks_proxy).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to allow arbitrary loads (if necessary):

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `flutter_socks_proxy` package, you need to create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and configure it with your SOCKS proxy details.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_socks_proxy/flutter_socks_proxy.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  // Method to initialize the SOCKS proxy
  void initializeProxy(String host, int port) {
    SocksProxy.setProxy(host, port);
  }

  // Method to make a network request through the proxy
  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    final response = await SocksProxy.get('https://api.example.com/data');
    // Handle the response
  }
}
```

In this example, we define a method to initialize the SOCKS proxy and another method to fetch data through the proxy.

With this setup, you can now route your network requests through a SOCKS proxy, enhancing your application's network capabilities.

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_socks_proxy`

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `flutter_socks_proxy` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_socks_proxy/flutter_socks_proxy.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter SOCKS Proxy Example',
      home: ProxyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class ProxyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ProxyHomePageState createState() => _ProxyHomePageState();
}

class _ProxyHomePageState extends State<ProxyHomePage> {
  String _data = 'No data fetched yet';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the SOCKS proxy with host and port
    RealFlutter().initializeProxy('127.0.0.1', 1080);
    // Fetch data through the proxy
    fetchData();
  }

  // Method to fetch data from the API
  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    try {
      // Make a network request through the SOCKS proxy
      final response = await SocksProxy.get('https://api.example.com/data');
      setState(() {
        _data = response.body; // Update the state with fetched data
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _data = 'Error fetching data: $e'; // Handle errors
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SOCKS Proxy Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(_data), // Display fetched data
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets ProxyHomePage as the home widget.
// 3. In ProxyHomePage, the initState method is called when the widget is first created.
// 4. The SOCKS proxy is initialized with a specified host and port.
// 5. The fetchData method is called to make a network request through the SOCKS proxy.
// 6. If the request is successful, the fetched data is displayed on the screen.
// 7. If an error occurs, an error message is shown instead.
```
