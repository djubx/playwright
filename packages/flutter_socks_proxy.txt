// This code creates a SOCKS proxy server and configures the app to use it for all HTTP requests.
// The proxy server is started when the app is initialized, and the app's HTTP client is overridden to use the proxy server.
// The app's UI displays the host and port of the proxy server.
// When the app makes an HTTP request, the request is routed through the proxy server, which forwards the request to the destination server.
// The response from the destination server is then routed back through the proxy server and returned to the app.
