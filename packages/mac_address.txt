# Overview of the `mac_address` Flutter Package

The `mac_address` package is a Flutter plugin that allows developers to easily retrieve the MAC address of the device on which their application is running. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where device identification is necessary, such as in network applications, device management systems, or for analytics purposes.

## When to Use This Package

- **Network Applications**: When you need to identify devices on a local network.
- **Device Management**: For applications that require unique device identification for security or tracking purposes.
- **Analytics**: To gather data on device usage and behavior based on unique identifiers.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate and use within your Flutter applications.
- **Real-Time Access**: Fetches the MAC address in real-time, ensuring you have the most current data.

The `mac_address` package simplifies the process of obtaining the MAC address, making it a valuable tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance their applications with device identification capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `mac_address` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `mac_address` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  mac_address: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, you need to ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to access network state. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add a usage description in your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`. Add the following key-value pair:

```xml
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the local network to retrieve the MAC address.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve and display the MAC address.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mac_address/mac_address.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('MAC Address Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<String>(
            future: MacAddress.getMacAddress(), // Fetching MAC address
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'); // Show error message
              } else {
                return Text('MAC Address: ${snapshot.data}'); // Display MAC address
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we use a `FutureBuilder` to asynchronously fetch the MAC address and display it on the screen. The `CircularProgressIndicator` is shown while the MAC address is being retrieved.

# Complete Example of Using the `mac_address` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mac_address/mac_address.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the application with RealFlutter widget
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('MAC Address Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder<String>(
            future: MacAddress.getMacAddress(), // Fetching MAC address
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator while waiting
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}'); // Show error message if any
              } else {
                return Text('MAC Address: ${snapshot.data}'); // Display the retrieved MAC address
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a FutureBuilder is used to asynchronously fetch the MAC address using MacAddress.getMacAddress().
// 4. While the MAC address is being fetched, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed to indicate loading.
// 5. If an error occurs during the fetching process, an error message is displayed.
// 6. Once the MAC address is successfully retrieved, it is displayed in the center of the screen.
