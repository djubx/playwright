# Setting Up and Using Slang Build Runner

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **slang_build_runner** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter project.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **slang_build_runner** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  slang_build_runner: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/slang_build_runner).

## Step 2: Running the Build Runner

After adding the dependency, you need to run the build runner to generate the necessary files. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory, then execute:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This command will generate the code based on the configurations specified in your project.

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file is configured correctly. You may need to add specific configurations depending on your project requirements. Here’s a basic example:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    buildTypes {
        release {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` file is set up correctly. You might need to adjust the build settings to accommodate the generated files.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Once the setup is complete, you can start using the **slang_build_runner** package in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
import 'package:slang_build_runner/slang_build_runner.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize the build runner
  final runner = SlangBuildRunner();
  runner.start();
}
```

This code initializes the build runner and starts the build process.

By following these steps, you can effectively set up and use the **slang_build_runner** package in your Flutter projects.

# Complete Example of Slang Build Runner in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:slang_build_runner/slang_build_runner.dart';

void main() {
  // Entry point of the Flutter application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build the main application widget
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Slang Build Runner Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build the home screen widget
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Trigger the build process when the button is pressed
            final runner = SlangBuildRunner();
            runner.start();
            // Show a message indicating the build has started
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text('Build process started!')),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Start Build Process'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() to start the app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main MaterialApp widget.
// 3. The HomeScreen class is another StatelessWidget that builds the home screen with an AppBar and a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it initializes the SlangBuildRunner and starts the build process.
// 5. A SnackBar message is displayed to inform the user that the build process has started.
```
