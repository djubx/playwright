# Complete Example of Colorful Circular Progress Indicator

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:colorful_circular_progress_indicator/colorful_circular_progress_indicator.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Colorful Circular Progress Indicator Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Colorful Circular Progress Indicator'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ProgressIndicatorDemo(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ProgressIndicatorDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ProgressIndicatorDemoState createState() => _ProgressIndicatorDemoState();
}

class _ProgressIndicatorDemoState extends State<ProgressIndicatorDemo> {
  double _progress = 0.0; // Variable to track progress

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _startProgress(); // Start the progress when the widget is initialized
  }

  void _startProgress() async {
    while (_progress < 1.0) {
      await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 100)); // Delay for smooth animation
      setState(() {
        _progress += 0.1; // Increment progress
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Colorful Circular Progress Indicator
        ColorfulCircularProgressIndicator(
          duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
          colors: [Colors.red, Colors.green, Colors.blue],
          strokeWidth: 10,
          // Set the progress value
          value: _progress,
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        Text(
          'Progress: ${(_progress * 100).toStringAsFixed(0)}%', // Display progress percentage
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the Colorful Circular Progress Indicator.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app and sets up the home screen.
// 2. The `MyApp` class builds the main structure of the app, including the AppBar and body.
// 3. The `ProgressIndicatorDemo` class is a StatefulWidget that manages the progress state.
// 4. In `initState`, the `_startProgress` method is called to begin updating the progress.
// 5. The `_startProgress` method increments the `_progress` variable every 100 milliseconds until it reaches 1.0.
// 6. The `build` method returns a Column containing the Colorful Circular Progress Indicator and a Text widget displaying the current progress percentage.
// 7. The Colorful Circular Progress Indicator is customized with colors and stroke width, and it visually represents the loading state of the application.
