# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "easter" Package

## Installation
To get started with the "easter" package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to update your `ios/Podfile` to use a minimum platform version of 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create an Easter-themed screen using the "easter" package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easter/easter.dart'; // Import the easter package

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easter App',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Easter Celebration'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              EasterIcon(), // Use an Easter icon from the package
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(
                'Happy Easter!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application that displays an Easter icon and a greeting message.

        body: Center(

            children: [
              EasterIcon(), // Display an Easter-themed icon
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between the icon and text

                'Happy Easter!', // Greeting message
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold), // Text styling
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space below the text
              EasterAnimation(), // Add an Easter-themed animation
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the main MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the Easter icon, greeting text, and an animation vertically.
// 5. EasterIcon() displays a festive icon, while EasterAnimation() adds a playful animation to the UI.
// 6. The app is designed to celebrate Easter with a simple and engaging interface.
