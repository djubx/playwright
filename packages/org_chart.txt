# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `org_chart` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `org_chart` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  org_chart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `org_chart` package:

```dart
import 'package:org_chart/org_chart.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `OrgChart` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create an organizational chart:

```dart
OrgChart(
  nodes: [
    Node(
      id: '1',
      name: 'CEO',
      children: [
        Node(id: '2', name: 'CTO'),
        Node(id: '3', name: 'CFO'),
      ],
    ),
  ],
)
```

This code snippet creates a basic organizational chart with a CEO at the top and two direct reports: the CTO and CFO.

## Step 5: Customizing Nodes

You can customize the appearance of nodes by providing additional parameters such as color, shape, and size. For example:

```dart
Node(
  id: '1',
  name: 'CEO',
  color: Colors.blue,
  shape: BoxShape.rectangle,
  size: Size(100, 50),
)
```

This customization allows you to create a visually appealing chart that matches your app's design.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `org_chart` package effectively in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using the `org_chart` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:org_chart/org_chart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Org Chart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Organizational Chart'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: OrgChart(
            nodes: [
              // Creating the root node (CEO)
              Node(
                id: '1',
                name: 'CEO',
                // Adding children nodes (CTO and CFO)
                children: [
                  Node(
                    id: '2',
                    name: 'CTO',
                    // Adding children to CTO
                    children: [
                      Node(id: '4', name: 'Dev Team Lead'),
                      Node(id: '5', name: 'QA Team Lead'),
                    ],
                  ),
                  Node(
                    id: '3',
                    name: 'CFO',
                    // Adding children to CFO
                    children: [
                      Node(id: '6', name: 'Finance Manager'),
                      Node(id: '7', name: 'Accountant'),
                    ],
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Organizational Chart".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers the OrgChart widget.
// 5. The OrgChart widget is populated with a root node (CEO) and its children (CTO and CFO).
// 6. Each child node can have its own children, creating a multi-level organizational structure.
// 7. The application displays the organizational chart visually, allowing users to understand the hierarchy at a glance.
```
