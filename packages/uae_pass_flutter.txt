# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `uae_pass_flutter`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `uae_pass_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  uae_pass_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions and metadata:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application
        android:label="your_app_name"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        
        <meta-data
            android:name="uae_pass_client_id"
            android:value="YOUR_UAE_PASS_CLIENT_ID" />
        <meta-data
            android:name="uae_pass_redirect_uri"
            android:value="YOUR_UAE_PASS_REDIRECT_URI" />
        
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries:

```xml
<key>UAE_PASS_CLIENT_ID</key>
<string>YOUR_UAE_PASS_CLIENT_ID</string>
<key>UAE_PASS_REDIRECT_URI</key>
<string>YOUR_UAE_PASS_REDIRECT_URI</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have configured the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the authentication flow.

# Complete Example of `uae_pass_flutter`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:uae_pass_flutter/uae_pass_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'UAE Pass Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _userInfo = "Not logged in";

  // Function to initiate the UAE Pass login
  void _loginWithUAEPass() async {
    try {
      // Start the UAE Pass authentication process
      final result = await UAEPassFlutter.login();

      // Check if the login was successful
      if (result != null) {
        setState(() {
          _userInfo = "Logged in as: ${result.userName}"; // Display user name
        });
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors during the login process
      setState(() {
        _userInfo = "Login failed: $e"; // Display error message
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('UAE Pass Authentication'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_userInfo), // Display user information
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _loginWithUAEPass, // Trigger login on button press
              child: Text('Login with UAE Pass'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home screen is set to RealFlutter, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. In RealFlutter, we have a button that triggers the _loginWithUAEPass function when pressed.
// 4. The _loginWithUAEPass function calls the UAEPassFlutter.login() method to initiate the login process.
// 5. If the login is successful, the user's name is displayed; otherwise, an error message is shown.
```
