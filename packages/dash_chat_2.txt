# Tutorial: Setting Up Dash Chat 2

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **dash_chat_2** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **dash_chat_2** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dash_chat_2: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions for network access in your `Info.plist` file. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple chat interface. Below is a basic example of how to implement the chat UI using the **dash_chat_2** package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:dash_chat_2/dash_chat_2.dart';
```

2. Create a `RealFlutter` class that extends `StatelessWidget` or `StatefulWidget` depending on your needs.

3. Use the `DashChat` widget to create the chat interface.

### Example Code Snippet

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Chat Example")),
        body: DashChat(
          user: ChatUser(
            id: "user_id",
            name: "User Name",
            avatar: "https://example.com/avatar.png",
          ),
          messages: [], // Initialize with an empty list
          onSend: (message) {
            // Handle message sending
            print("Message sent: ${message.text}");
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic chat interface where users can send messages. The `onSend` callback is triggered when a message is sent, allowing you to handle the message as needed.

# Complete Example of Dash Chat 2

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates all key features of the **dash_chat_2** package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dash_chat_2/dash_chat_2.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List to hold messages
  List<ChatMessage> messages = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Chat Example")),
        body: DashChat(
          user: ChatUser(
            id: "user_id", // Unique user ID
            name: "User Name", // User's name
            avatar: "https://example.com/avatar.png", // User's avatar URL
          ),
          messages: messages, // Pass the list of messages
          onSend: (message) {
            // Handle message sending
            setState(() {
              messages.add(message); // Add the new message to the list
            });
            print("Message sent: ${message.text}"); // Log the sent message
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the chat messages.
// 3. The _RealFlutterState class contains a list of messages that will be displayed in the chat.
// 4. The DashChat widget is used to create the chat interface, where the user and messages are defined.
// 5. When a message is sent, the onSend callback is triggered, adding the message to the messages list and updating the UI.
// 6. The app displays the chat interface with the ability to send and receive messages in real-time.
```
