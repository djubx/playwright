# Fluent Query Builder: A Comprehensive Guide

## <-- START_DESCRIPTION -->

### Overview of `fluent_query_builder`

The `fluent_query_builder` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to construct complex SQL queries in a more readable and maintainable way. This package allows developers to build queries using a fluent interface, which can significantly reduce the boilerplate code typically associated with SQL query construction. 

### When to Use `fluent_query_builder`

You might consider using `fluent_query_builder` in scenarios such as:
- When you need to build dynamic SQL queries based on user input or application state.
- When you want to improve the readability of your SQL queries in your Flutter application.
- When you are working with databases like SQLite and want to streamline your data access layer.

### Key Features

- **Fluent Interface**: Build queries in a chainable manner, making the code more intuitive.
- **Support for Multiple SQL Operations**: Easily construct SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that the queries are type-checked at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
- **Integration with Dart's Future and Stream**: Works seamlessly with asynchronous programming in Dart.

### Setup Process

To get started with the `fluent_query_builder` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     fluent_query_builder: ^1.0.0
   ```

   Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

2. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` has the necessary permissions for database access.
   - **iOS**: Update your `Info.plist` to include any required permissions for accessing local databases.

3. **Import the Package**: In your Dart files, import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:fluent_query_builder/fluent_query_builder.dart';
   ```

### Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `fluent_query_builder` package to create a SELECT query:

```dart
void main() {
  final query = QueryBuilder()
      .select('users')
      .where('age', '>', 18)
      .orderBy('name', ascending: true)
      .build();

  print(query); // Outputs: SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18 ORDER BY name ASC
}
```

This example demonstrates how to construct a basic SQL SELECT query using the fluent interface provided by the package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fluent_query_builder/fluent_query_builder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fluent Query Builder Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Fluent Query Builder Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create a query to select users older than 18
              final query = QueryBuilder()
                  .select('users')
                  .where('age', '>', 18)
                  .orderBy('name', ascending: true)
                  .build();

              // Print the generated SQL query
              print(query); // Outputs: SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18 ORDER BY name ASC
            },
            child: Text('Generate Query'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title "Fluent Query Builder Demo".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, generates a SQL query using the fluent_query_builder package.
// 6. The generated SQL query selects users older than 18 and orders them by name in ascending order.
// 7. Finally, the generated SQL query is printed to the console.
```

### Final Summary

In this blog post, we explored the `fluent_query_builder` package, which provides a fluent interface for constructing SQL queries in Flutter applications. We walked through the setup process, including platform-specific configurations, and demonstrated how to use the package with a simple example. Finally, we provided a complete Flutter application that showcases the key features of the package, including generating a SQL query based on user interaction. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to enhance the readability and maintainability of their database queries in Flutter.
