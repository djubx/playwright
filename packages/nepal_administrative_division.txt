# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Nepal Administrative Division Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `nepal_administrative_division` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  nepal_administrative_division: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:nepal_administrative_division/nepal_administrative_division.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to access administrative divisions. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to fetch and display the provinces of Nepal:

```dart
void main() {
  List<Province> provinces = NepalAdministrativeDivision.getProvinces();
  // Use the provinces list in your application
}
```

This will give you a list of provinces that you can use in your UI.

# Complete Example of Using the Nepal Administrative Division Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nepal_administrative_division/nepal_administrative_division.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Nepal Administrative Division',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Fetching the list of provinces
    List<Province> provinces = NepalAdministrativeDivision.getProvinces();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Nepal Administrative Divisions'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: provinces.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          // Displaying each province in a ListTile
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(provinces[index].name), // Displaying province name
            subtitle: Text('Districts: ${provinces[index].districts.length}'), // Displaying number of districts
            onTap: () {
              // Navigate to the details of the selected province
              Navigator.push(
                context,
                MaterialPageRoute(
                  builder: (context) => DistrictScreen(province: provinces[index]),
                ),
              );
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DistrictScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final Province province;

  DistrictScreen({required this.province});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(province.name),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: province.districts.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          // Displaying each district in a ListTile
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(province.districts[index].name), // Displaying district name
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen fetches the list of provinces using the package.
// 4. A ListView displays each province, showing its name and the number of districts.
// 5. Tapping on a province navigates to the DistrictScreen, which shows the districts of the selected province.
// 6. The DistrictScreen displays a list of districts for the selected province.
```
