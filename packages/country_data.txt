# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Country Data Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `country_data` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  country_data: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package as follows:

```dart
import 'package:country_data/country_data.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `CountryData` class to access country information. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to fetch and display country data:

```dart
void main() {
  // Fetching country data
  var countries = CountryData.getAllCountries();
  print(countries); // This will print a list of all countries
}
```

This will give you a list of all countries available in the dataset. You can access specific details like country names, codes, and more.

## Conclusion

With these steps, you should be able to set up and start using the `country_data` package in your Flutter applications. The package is straightforward to integrate and provides a wealth of information that can enhance your app's functionality.

# Complete Example of Using the Country Data Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:country_data/country_data.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Country Data Example',
      home: CountryListScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CountryListScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Fetching all countries from the country_data package
    final countries = CountryData.getAllCountries();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Country List'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: countries.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          // Each item in the list displays the country name and code
          final country = countries[index];
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(country.name), // Display country name
            subtitle: Text(country.code), // Display country code
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The CountryListScreen widget is displayed as the home screen, which contains a list of countries.
// 4. Inside CountryListScreen, we fetch all countries using CountryData.getAllCountries().
// 5. A ListView.builder is used to create a scrollable list of countries.
// 6. Each ListTile displays the name and code of a country, making it easy for users to view country information.
