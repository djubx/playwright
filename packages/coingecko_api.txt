# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `coingecko_api` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `coingecko_api` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  coingecko_api: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle`.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

### Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart files, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:coingecko_api/coingecko_api.dart';
```

## Using the Package

Once the package is set up, you can start using it to fetch cryptocurrency data. Here’s a simple example of how to fetch the current price of Bitcoin:

```dart
void fetchBitcoinPrice() async {
  final coingecko = CoinGeckoApi();
  final price = await coingecko.simple.price(ids: ['bitcoin'], vs_currencies: ['usd']);
  print('Current Bitcoin Price: \$${price['bitcoin']['usd']}');
}
```

This function initializes the `CoinGeckoApi`, fetches the current price of Bitcoin in USD, and prints it to the console.

# Complete Example

Here’s a complete Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `coingecko_api` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:coingecko_api/coingecko_api.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Crypto Price Tracker',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CryptoPriceScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CryptoPriceScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CryptoPriceScreenState createState() => _CryptoPriceScreenState();
}

class _CryptoPriceScreenState extends State<CryptoPriceScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the current price of Bitcoin
  String _bitcoinPrice = 'Loading...';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch the Bitcoin price when the widget is initialized
    _fetchBitcoinPrice();
  }

  // Function to fetch the current price of Bitcoin
  void _fetchBitcoinPrice() async {
    final coingecko = CoinGeckoApi();
    // Fetch the price and update the state
    final price = await coingecko.simple.price(ids: ['bitcoin'], vs_currencies: ['usd']);
    setState(() {
      _bitcoinPrice = '\$${price['bitcoin']['usd']}'; // Update the price variable
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Crypto Price Tracker'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Current Bitcoin Price: $_bitcoinPrice', // Display the price
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _fetchBitcoinPrice, // Refresh price on button press
        tooltip: 'Refresh',
        child: Icon(Icons.refresh),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to CryptoPriceScreen, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In the _CryptoPriceScreenState, the _bitcoinPrice variable is initialized.
// 5. The _fetchBitcoinPrice function is called in initState to get the Bitcoin price.
// 6. The price is fetched from the CoinGecko API and the state is updated.
// 7. The build method displays the current price in the center of the screen.
// 8. A FloatingActionButton allows users to refresh the price by calling _fetchBitcoinPrice again.
```
