# Tutorial: Setting Up the Dynatrace Flutter Plugin

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `dynatrace_flutter_plugin` and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `dynatrace_flutter_plugin` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dynatrace_flutter_plugin: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Initialize Dynatrace**: In your `MainActivity.java` or `MainActivity.kt`, initialize Dynatrace in the `onCreate` method:

   ```java
   import com.dynatrace.android.sdk.Dynatrace;

   @Override
   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
       Dynatrace.start("YOUR_DYNATRACE_APP_KEY");
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Initialize Dynatrace**: In your `AppDelegate.swift`, initialize Dynatrace in the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method:

   ```swift
   import Dynatrace

   @UIApplicationMain
   class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
       override func application(
           _ application: UIApplication,
           didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
       ) -> Bool {
           Dynatrace.start("YOUR_DYNATRACE_APP_KEY")
           GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)
           return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
       }
   }
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Plugin

Now that you have set up the plugin, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to track user interactions and log custom events.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dynatrace_flutter_plugin/dynatrace_flutter_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dynatrace Flutter Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dynatrace Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Log a custom event when the button is pressed
            Dynatrace.logEvent("Button Pressed", {"button": "example"});
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we log a custom event when the button is pressed, which can be viewed in the Dynatrace dashboard.

# Complete Example: Dynatrace Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dynatrace_flutter_plugin/dynatrace_flutter_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dynatrace Flutter Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dynatrace Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Log a custom event when the button is pressed
            Dynatrace.logEvent("Button Pressed", {"button": "example"});
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen is a StatelessWidget that contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, a custom event "Button Pressed" is logged to Dynatrace with additional data.
// 6. This event can be monitored in the Dynatrace dashboard, allowing developers to analyze user interactions.
```
