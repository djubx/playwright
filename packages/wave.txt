Here's a detailed technical blog on the "wave" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Wave Flutter Package

The **wave** Flutter package is a powerful tool for creating beautiful wave animations in your Flutter applications. It allows developers to easily integrate wave effects into their UI, enhancing the visual appeal of their apps. This package is particularly useful for applications that require dynamic backgrounds, loading indicators, or any other UI elements that benefit from fluid motion.

## When to Use the Wave Package

You might consider using the wave package in scenarios such as:
- **Background Animations**: To create engaging backgrounds that capture user attention.
- **Loading Indicators**: To provide a visually appealing loading experience while data is being fetched.
- **Custom UI Elements**: To enhance buttons, cards, or any other widgets with wave effects.

## Features

- **Customizable Wave Properties**: Adjust the amplitude, frequency, and speed of the waves to fit your design needs.
- **Multiple Wave Layers**: Create complex wave animations by stacking multiple wave layers.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick implementation in any Flutter project.

With these features, the wave package can significantly enhance the user experience by adding a dynamic and interactive element to your Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Wave Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the wave package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wave: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions or configurations in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. However, the wave package does not require any specific configurations for basic usage.

## Step 3: Using the Wave Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a wave animation.

# Complete Example: Wave Animation in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wave/wave.dart';
import 'package:wave/config.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Wave Animation Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Wave Animation'),
        ),
        body: WaveAnimation(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class WaveAnimation extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Stack(
      children: [
        // Background color
        Container(
          color: Colors.blueAccent,
        ),
        // Wave animation
        WaveWidget(
          config: CustomConfig(
            gradients: [
              [Colors.lightBlue, Colors.blue],
              [Colors.blue, Colors.deepPurple],
            ],
            durations: [35000, 19440],
            heightPercentages: [0.20, 0.25],
            blur: MaskFilter.blur(BlurStyle.normal, 10),
          ),
          size: Size(double.infinity, double.infinity),
          waveAmplitude: 10,
          waveFrequency: 1.5,
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains the WaveAnimation widget.
// 5. The WaveAnimation widget uses a Stack to layer the background color and the wave animation.
// 6. The WaveWidget is configured with custom gradients, durations, and height percentages to create a dynamic wave effect.
// 7. The wave animation runs indefinitely, providing a visually appealing background for the app.
```

## Summary

In this blog, we explored the **wave** Flutter package, detailing its features and use cases. We walked through the setup process, including platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS. Finally, we provided a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates how to implement wave animations using the package. The application features a simple wave animation layered over a blue background, showcasing the ease of integrating dynamic visual elements into your Flutter apps.
