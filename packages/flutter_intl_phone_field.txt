# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_intl_phone_field

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_intl_phone_field` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_intl_phone_field` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_intl_phone_field: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions for internet access if you plan to use features that require network connectivity:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file to allow for network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the `IntlPhoneField` widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_intl_phone_field/flutter_intl_phone_field.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('International Phone Field Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: IntlPhoneField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Phone Number',
              border: OutlineInputBorder(),
            ),
            initialCountryCode: 'US', // Set the default country code
            onChanged: (phone) {
              print(phone.completeNumber); // Get the complete phone number
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with an `IntlPhoneField` widget. The user can select their country code and input their phone number. The complete phone number can be accessed via the `onChanged` callback.

# Complete Example: A Functional Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_intl_phone_field/flutter_intl_phone_field.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('International Phone Field Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: IntlPhoneField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Phone Number', // Label for the phone number field
              border: OutlineInputBorder(), // Styling the input field
            ),
            initialCountryCode: 'US', // Default country code set to US
            onChanged: (phone) {
              // Callback function that gets triggered when the phone number changes
              print(phone.completeNumber); // Print the complete phone number to the console
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body consists of an IntlPhoneField widget, which allows users to input their phone number.
// 4. The user can select their country code from a dropdown, and the input field will format the phone number accordingly.
// 5. Whenever the user changes the phone number, the onChanged callback is triggered, printing the complete phone number to the console.
```
