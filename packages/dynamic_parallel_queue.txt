# Dynamic Parallel Queue: A Flutter Package for Efficient Task Management

The `dynamic_parallel_queue` package is a powerful tool for managing asynchronous tasks in Flutter applications. It allows developers to execute multiple tasks in parallel while dynamically adjusting the number of concurrent tasks based on system resources and user-defined limits. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to handle multiple network requests, file processing, or any other asynchronous operations that can benefit from parallel execution.

## When to Use This Package
- **Network Requests**: When you need to fetch data from multiple APIs simultaneously.
- **File Processing**: For applications that require processing multiple files at once, such as image uploads or downloads.
- **Data Synchronization**: When syncing data between local storage and a remote server.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Concurrency**: Automatically adjusts the number of concurrent tasks based on system performance.
- **Task Prioritization**: Allows you to set priorities for tasks, ensuring that more important tasks are executed first.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to handle errors gracefully during task execution.
- **Progress Tracking**: Provides callbacks to track the progress of tasks, making it easier to update the UI accordingly.

Overall, `dynamic_parallel_queue` is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to optimize their applications' performance by efficiently managing asynchronous tasks.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dynamic Parallel Queue

## Installation
To add the `dynamic_parallel_queue` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dynamic_parallel_queue: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your tasks involve network requests or file access.

## Basic Usage
To use the `dynamic_parallel_queue`, you need to create an instance of the `DynamicParallelQueue` class and define your tasks. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:dynamic_parallel_queue/dynamic_parallel_queue.dart';

void main() {
  // Create an instance of DynamicParallelQueue
  final queue = DynamicParallelQueue();

  // Add tasks to the queue
  queue.addTask(() async {
    // Simulate a network request
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
    print('Task 1 completed');
  });

  queue.addTask(() async {
    // Simulate another network request
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
    print('Task 2 completed');
  });

  // Start processing the queue
  queue.start();
}
```

In this example, two tasks are added to the queue, and they will be executed in parallel. You can customize the number of concurrent tasks and handle task completion and errors as needed.

# Complete Example of Dynamic Parallel Queue in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dynamic_parallel_queue/dynamic_parallel_queue.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dynamic Parallel Queue Example',
      home: TaskManager(),
    );
  }
}

class TaskManager extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TaskManagerState createState() => _TaskManagerState();
}

class _TaskManagerState extends State<TaskManager> {
  final DynamicParallelQueue _queue = DynamicParallelQueue();
  final List<String> _results = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _setupTasks();
  }

  void _setupTasks() {
    // Adding tasks to the queue
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
      _queue.addTask(() async {
        // Simulate a network request with a delay
        await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: i));
        return 'Task $i completed'; // Return the result of the task
      });
    }

    // Start processing the queue
    _queue.start().then((results) {
      // Update the state with the results once all tasks are completed
      setState(() {
        _results.addAll(results);
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dynamic Parallel Queue Example'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: _results.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(_results[index]),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// 2. `MyApp` builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget, `TaskManager`.
// 3. In `TaskManager`, we create an instance of `DynamicParallelQueue` to manage our tasks.
// 4. In the `initState` method, we call `_setupTasks` to add tasks to the queue.
// 5. We add five tasks to the queue, each simulating a network request with a delay based on the task number.
// 6. After adding the tasks, we start processing the queue. Once all tasks are completed, we update the state with the results.
// 7. The `build` method constructs a ListView to display the results of the completed tasks.
// 8. Each task's result is displayed in a ListTile, showing the order in which they completed.
```

### Summary
In this blog post, we explored the `dynamic_parallel_queue` Flutter package, which provides an efficient way to manage asynchronous tasks in parallel. We covered the installation process, platform-specific configurations, and provided a complete example demonstrating how to set up and use the package effectively. The example application showcases how to add tasks to the queue, process them, and display the results in a user-friendly manner. This package is ideal for developers looking to optimize their Flutter applications by handling multiple tasks concurrently.
