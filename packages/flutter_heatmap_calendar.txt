# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Heatmap Calendar

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of setting up the `flutter_heatmap_calendar` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `flutter_heatmap_calendar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_heatmap_calendar: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_heatmap_calendar/flutter_heatmap_calendar.dart';
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

#### Android

Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to a compatible version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

### Step 4: Using the Heatmap Calendar

Create a widget using the `HeatMapCalendar` class. Customize it according to your needs:

```dart
HeatMapCalendar(
  input: {
    DateTime(2023, 9, 1): 5,
    DateTime(2023, 9, 2): 10,
    // Add more data points
  },
  colorThresholds: {
    1: Colors.green[100]!,
    5: Colors.green[300]!,
    10: Colors.green[500]!,
  },
  weekDaysLabels: ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"],
  monthsLabels: ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"],
  squareSize: 16.0,
  textOpacity: 0.3,
  labelTextColor: Colors.blueGrey,
  dayTextColor: Colors.blue[800],
)
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_heatmap_calendar/flutter_heatmap_calendar.dart';

void main() => runApp(RealFlutter());

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Heatmap Calendar Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HeatmapCalendarPage(),
    );
  }
}

class HeatmapCalendarPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Heatmap Calendar'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: HeatMapCalendar(
          // Input data for the heatmap
          input: {
            DateTime(2023, 9, 1): 5,
            DateTime(2023, 9, 2): 10,
            DateTime(2023, 9, 3): 2,
            // Add more data points as needed
          },
          // Define color thresholds for different data values
          colorThresholds: {
            1: Colors.green[100]!,
            5: Colors.green[300]!,
            10: Colors.green[500]!,
          },
          // Customize labels for weekdays
          weekDaysLabels: ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"],
          // Customize labels for months
          monthsLabels: ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"],
          // Set the size of each square in the heatmap
          squareSize: 16.0,
          // Set the opacity of the text within the squares
          textOpacity: 0.3,
          // Set the color of the label text
          labelTextColor: Colors.blueGrey,
          // Set the color of the day text
          dayTextColor: Colors.blue[800],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by running `RealFlutter`, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. `RealFlutter` sets up a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies `HeatmapCalendarPage` as the home widget.
// 3. `HeatmapCalendarPage` is a StatelessWidget that builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered `HeatMapCalendar` widget.
// 4. The `HeatMapCalendar` widget is configured with input data, color thresholds, and labels for days and months.
// 5. The heatmap displays data points with varying colors based on the thresholds, providing a visual representation of the data.
