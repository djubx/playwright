# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Animated Item Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **animated_item** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_item: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement animated items in a list.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:animated_item/animated_item.dart';
```

2. Use the `AnimatedItem` widget to wrap the items you want to animate. You can specify the animation duration and curve.

Here’s a basic example of how to use the `AnimatedItem` widget in a list:

```dart
ListView.builder(
  itemCount: items.length,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return AnimatedItem(
      duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
      child: ListTile(
        title: Text(items[index]),
      ),
    );
  },
);
```

This setup will animate each `ListTile` as it enters the view.

# Complete Example of Using Animated Item

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_item/animated_item.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Item Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Item Example'),
        ),
        body: AnimatedListExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class AnimatedListExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AnimatedListExampleState createState() => _AnimatedListExampleState();
}

class _AnimatedListExampleState extends State<AnimatedListExample> {
  // List to hold items
  final List<String> items = List.generate(10, (index) => 'Item $index');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: items.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        // Wrapping each item with AnimatedItem for animation
        return AnimatedItem(
          duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300), // Animation duration
          child: ListTile(
            title: Text(items[index]), // Displaying item text
            onTap: () {
              // Remove item on tap
              setState(() {
                items.removeAt(index); // Remove item from list
              });
            },
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home scaffold containing an AppBar and the AnimatedListExample widget.
// 3. AnimatedListExample is a stateful widget that maintains a list of items.
// 4. The build method creates a ListView.builder that generates a list of AnimatedItem widgets.
// 5. Each AnimatedItem wraps a ListTile, which displays the item text and has an onTap callback to remove the item from the list.
// 6. When an item is tapped, it is removed from the list, and the animation is triggered as the item exits the view.
```
