# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Google Places Picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `google_places_picker` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `google_places_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_places_picker: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/google_places_picker).

## Step 2: Obtain Google Places API Key

You will need a Google Places API key to use this package. Follow these steps to obtain one:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Navigate to the "APIs & Services" section and enable the "Places API".
4. Go to "Credentials" and create an API key.

## Step 3: Configure Android

For Android, you need to add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

Also, ensure that you add your API key in the `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
    android:value="YOUR_API_KEY"/>
```

## Step 4: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show nearby places.</string>
```

Also, ensure that you add your API key in the `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>GMSApiKey</key>
<string>YOUR_API_KEY</string>
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the Google Places Picker.

# Complete Example of Google Places Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_places_picker/google_places_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Google Places Picker Example',
      home: PlacesPickerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PlacesPickerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PlacesPickerScreenState createState() => _PlacesPickerScreenState();
}

class _PlacesPickerScreenState extends State<PlacesPickerScreen> {
  String? selectedPlace; // Variable to hold the selected place

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Google Places Picker'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected place
            Text(
              selectedPlace ?? 'No place selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Open the Google Places Picker
                final result = await showPlacesPicker(
                  context: context,
                  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY', // Your Google Places API key
                );

                // Check if a place was selected
                if (result != null) {
                  setState(() {
                    selectedPlace = result.name; // Update the selected place
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick a Place'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and the home screen.
// 3. The PlacesPickerScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the selected place.
// 4. When the user taps the "Pick a Place" button, the Google Places Picker is opened.
// 5. After the user selects a place, the result is returned and displayed on the screen.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that allows users to pick a place using the Google Places Picker. The application flow is straightforward:

1. The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
2. `RealFlutter` sets up the `MaterialApp` and the home screen, which is `PlacesPickerScreen`.
3. `PlacesPickerScreen` manages the state of the selected place.
4. When the user taps the "Pick a Place" button, the Google Places Picker is opened.
5. After the user selects a place, the result is returned and displayed on the screen.

This example demonstrates the key features of the `google_places_picker` package, providing a solid foundation for integrating location-based services into your Flutter applications.
