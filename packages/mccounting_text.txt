# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using mccounting_text

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `mccounting_text` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mccounting_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `CountingText` widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mccounting_text/mccounting_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Counting Text Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CountingText(
            count: 1000, // The final number to count to
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the animation
            curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Animation curve
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold), // Text style
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, the `CountingText` widget will animate from 0 to 1000 over 2 seconds with an ease-in-out curve.

# Complete Example of mccounting_text

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mccounting_text/mccounting_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Counting Text Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CountingText(
            count: 1000, // The final number to count to
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the animation
            curve: Curves.easeInOut, // Animation curve
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold), // Text style
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function takes the RealFlutter widget and makes it the root of the widget tree.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the basic structure for the app.
// 4. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which provides the app's basic visual layout.
// 5. An AppBar is added to the Scaffold with the title 'Counting Text Example'.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child widget.
// 7. The CountingText widget is used to display an animated counting text that counts to 1000 over 2 seconds.
// 8. The animation uses an ease-in-out curve for a smooth transition, and the text is styled to be large and bold.
```

In summary, the `mccounting_text` package provides a simple yet effective way to animate numerical values in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, you can easily integrate this package into your projects, enhancing the visual appeal and interactivity of your app.
