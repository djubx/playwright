# Setting Up and Using the Chart IQ Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `chart_iq` package and provide guidance on how to use it effectively in your Flutter applications.

## Installation

To get started, you need to add the `chart_iq` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  chart_iq: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/chart_iq).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow network requests if you are fetching data from an API. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a basic chart using the `chart_iq` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chart_iq/chart_iq.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Chart IQ Example')),
        body: ChartIQ(
          data: [
            {'x': '2023-01-01', 'y': 100},
            {'x': '2023-01-02', 'y': 110},
            {'x': '2023-01-03', 'y': 105},
            {'x': '2023-01-04', 'y': 115},
          ],
          type: ChartType.line,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple line chart with some sample data. The `ChartIQ` widget takes in a list of data points and a chart type.

Now that you have a basic understanding of how to set up and use the `chart_iq` package, let's move on to a complete example that demonstrates its capabilities in a more comprehensive manner.

# Complete Example of Chart IQ in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chart_iq/chart_iq.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Chart IQ Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ChartIQ(
            // Sample data for the chart
            data: [
              {'x': '2023-01-01', 'y': 100},
              {'x': '2023-01-02', 'y': 110},
              {'x': '2023-01-03', 'y': 105},
              {'x': '2023-01-04', 'y': 115},
              {'x': '2023-01-05', 'y': 120},
            ],
            // Specifying the type of chart
            type: ChartType.line,
            // Customizing the chart appearance
            lineColor: Colors.blue,
            lineWidth: 2.0,
            // Enabling grid lines for better readability
            showGrid: true,
            // Adding a title to the chart
            title: 'Sample Line Chart',
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title 'Chart IQ Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, we create a ChartIQ widget.
// 6. The ChartIQ widget is configured with sample data points, specifying the x and y values.
// 7. The chart type is set to 'line', and we customize its appearance with a blue line color and a width of 2.0.
// 8. Grid lines are enabled for better readability, and a title is added to the chart.
// 9. The app displays a simple line chart with the provided data, showcasing the capabilities of the chart_iq package.
