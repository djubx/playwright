# flutter_snackbar_content Package Overview

The `flutter_snackbar_content` package is a Flutter library designed to simplify the creation and customization of snackbars in your Flutter applications. Snackbars are brief messages that provide feedback about an operation in a way that doesn’t interrupt the user’s experience. This package allows developers to create snackbars with rich content, including icons, text, and actions, enhancing the user interface and experience.

## When to Use This Package
- When you need to display temporary messages to users without interrupting their workflow.
- When you want to provide feedback on user actions, such as form submissions or errors.
- When you want to customize the appearance and behavior of snackbars beyond the default Flutter implementation.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Content**: Easily create snackbars with custom widgets, including icons and buttons.
- **Flexible Design**: Control the appearance of the snackbar, including colors, shapes, and animations.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter applications.

# Setup and Usage of flutter_snackbar_content

## Installation
To use the `flutter_snackbar_content` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_snackbar_content: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_snackbar_content).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_snackbar_content` package, you can create a snackbar using the `SnackbarContent` widget. Here’s a simple example of how to display a snackbar:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_snackbar_content/flutter_snackbar_content.dart';

void showCustomSnackbar(BuildContext context) {
  final snackbar = SnackBar(
    content: SnackbarContent(
      message: 'This is a custom snackbar!',
      icon: Icon(Icons.info, color: Colors.white),
      backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
    ),
    duration: Duration(seconds: 3),
  );

  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(snackbar);
}
```

In this example, we create a snackbar with a custom message and an icon. The snackbar will be displayed for 3 seconds.

# Complete Example of flutter_snackbar_content

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_snackbar_content/flutter_snackbar_content.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Snackbar Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Snackbar Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Call the function to show the custom snackbar when the button is pressed
              showCustomSnackbar(context);
            },
            child: Text('Show Snackbar'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void showCustomSnackbar(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a snackbar with custom content
    final snackbar = SnackBar(
      content: SnackbarContent(
        message: 'This is a custom snackbar!',
        icon: Icon(Icons.info, color: Colors.white),
        backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
      ),
      duration: Duration(seconds: 3), // Set the duration for the snackbar
    );

    // Display the snackbar using the ScaffoldMessenger
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(snackbar);
  }
}
```

```
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// Inside the MaterialApp, we have a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// When the button is pressed, it triggers the showCustomSnackbar function.
// The showCustomSnackbar function creates a SnackBar with custom content using SnackbarContent.
// The snackbar includes a message, an icon, and a background color.
// Finally, the snackbar is displayed using the ScaffoldMessenger for 3 seconds.
```

## Summary
In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates how to use the `flutter_snackbar_content` package. The app features a button that, when pressed, shows a custom snackbar with a message and an icon. This showcases the package's ability to enhance user feedback in a visually appealing way.
