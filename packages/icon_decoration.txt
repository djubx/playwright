# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Icon Decoration Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `icon_decoration` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart

```

## Step 5: Using the Icon Decoration

You can now use the `IconDecoration` widget to decorate your icons. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
IconDecoration(
  icon: Icons.star,
  size: 50,
  decoration: IconDecorationStyle(
    shadow: Shadow(
      color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5),
      offset: Offset(2, 2),
      blurRadius: 5,
    ),
    gradient: LinearGradient(
      colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
    ),
    border: Border.all(color: Colors.white, width: 2),
  ),

```

This code snippet creates a star icon with a shadow, gradient, and border.

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Icon Decoration Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Icon Decoration Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Using IconDecoration to create a decorated icon
              IconDecoration(
                icon: Icons.star,
                size: 100, // Set the size of the icon
                decoration: IconDecorationStyle(
                  shadow: Shadow(
                    color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5), // Shadow color
                    offset: Offset(4, 4), // Shadow offset
                    blurRadius: 10, // Shadow blur radius
                  ),
                  gradient: LinearGradient(
                    colors: [Colors.red, Colors.orange], // Gradient colors
                  ),
                  border: Border.all(color: Colors.white, width: 4), // Border properties
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between icons
              // Another decorated icon
              IconDecoration(
                icon: Icons.favorite,
                size: 80, // Set the size of the icon
                decoration: IconDecorationStyle(
                  shadow: Shadow(
                    color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.3), // Shadow color
                    offset: Offset(2, 2), // Shadow offset
                    blurRadius: 5, // Shadow blur radius
                  ),
                  gradient: LinearGradient(
                    colors: [Colors.pink, Colors.purple], // Gradient colors
                  ),
                  border: Border.all(color: Colors.white, width: 2), // Border properties
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Icon Decoration Demo".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, two IconDecoration widgets are created:
//    - The first icon is a star with a red to orange gradient, a white border, and a shadow.
//    - The second icon is a heart with a pink to purple gradient, a white border, and a shadow.
// 6. The SizedBox provides spacing between the two icons for better visual separation.
