# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Drag Select Grid View

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `drag_select_grid_view` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `drag_select_grid_view` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  drag_select_grid_view: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/drag_select_grid_view).

## Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `DragSelectGridView`.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:drag_select_grid_view/drag_select_grid_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Drag Select Grid View Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Drag Select Grid View'),
        ),
        body: DragSelectGridViewExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DragSelectGridViewExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DragSelectGridViewExampleState createState() => _DragSelectGridViewExampleState();
}

class _DragSelectGridViewExampleState extends State<DragSelectGridViewExample> {
  // List to hold the selected items
  final List<int> selectedItems = [];
  
  // Sample data for the grid
  final List<String> items = List.generate(100, (index) => 'Item $index');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return DragSelectGridView(
      gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
        crossAxisCount: 4, // Number of columns in the grid
      ),
      itemCount: items.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index, isSelected) {
        return GestureDetector(
          onTap: () {
            // Toggle selection on tap
            setState(() {
              if (selectedItems.contains(index)) {
                selectedItems.remove(index);
              } else {
                selectedItems.add(index);
              }
            });
          },
          child: Container(
            margin: EdgeInsets.all(4.0),
            decoration: BoxDecoration(
              color: isSelected ? Colors.blue : Colors.grey[300],
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8.0),
            ),
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                items[index],
                style: TextStyle(
                  color: isSelected ? Colors.white : Colors.black,
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        );
      },
      onSelectionChanged: (selected) {
        // Update the selected items list
        setState(() {
          selectedItems.clear();
          selectedItems.addAll(selected);
        });
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp and Scaffold.
// 3. The DragSelectGridViewExample widget is created, which manages the state of selected items.
// 4. A grid view is built using DragSelectGridView, with a grid delegate defining the layout.
// 5. Each item in the grid is a GestureDetector that toggles selection on tap.
// 6. The onSelectionChanged callback updates the selected items list when the user drags across the grid.
// 7. The UI updates to reflect the selected state of each item, changing colors accordingly.
