# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `pincode_input_fields`

## Installation
To use the `pincode_input_fields` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pincode_input_fields: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you are using any features that require user permissions. However, for basic usage of the `pincode_input_fields`, no special configurations are needed.

## Using the Package
To use the `pincode_input_fields` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:pincode_input_fields/pincode_input_fields.dart';
```

You can then create a simple PIN input widget as follows:

```dart
PincodeInputFields(
  length: 4, // Length of the PIN
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Handle the value change
  },
)
```

This will create a basic PIN input field with a length of 4. You can customize it further by adjusting its properties.

# Complete Example of Using `pincode_input_fields`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pincode_input_fields/pincode_input_fields.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PIN Code Input Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('PIN Code Input'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: PinCodeInput(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PinCodeInput extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PinCodeInputState createState() => _PinCodeInputState();
}

class _PinCodeInputState extends State<PinCodeInput> {
  String pinCode = ''; // Variable to hold the entered PIN code

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the PIN input fields
        PincodeInputFields(
          length: 4, // Set the length of the PIN
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              pinCode = value; // Update the pinCode variable on change
            });
          },
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        // Display the entered PIN code
        Text('Entered PIN: $pinCode'),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body contains a PinCodeInput widget, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. Inside the PinCodeInput widget, we maintain a state variable `pinCode` to store the user's input.
// 5. The PincodeInputFields widget is created with a length of 4, and it updates the `pinCode` variable whenever the user inputs a digit.
// 6. Below the input fields, the entered PIN code is displayed in real-time, allowing users to see what they have entered.
