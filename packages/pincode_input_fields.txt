// This is the main entry point of the app.
// We create a new instance of the `RealFlutter` widget and run it.
// The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that contains a `PincodeInputFields` widget.
// The `PincodeInputFields` widget is used to input a pin code.
// When the user inputs a pin code, the `onChanged` callback is called with the new pin code.
// If there is an error, the `onError` callback is called with the error message.
// We use the `decoration` property to customize the look and feel of the pin code input fields.

// The app flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a pin code input field.
// 2. The user inputs a pin code and the `onChanged` callback is called.
// 3. If the pin code is valid, the app proceeds to the next step.
// 4. If the pin code is invalid, the `onError` callback is called and an error message is displayed.
// 5. The user can try again to input a valid pin code.
