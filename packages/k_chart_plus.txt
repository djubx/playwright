# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using k_chart_plus

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `k_chart_plus` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `k_chart_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  k_chart_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/k_chart_plus).

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `k_chart_plus` package:

```dart
import 'package:k_chart_plus/k_chart_plus.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `k_chart_plus` package to create charts. Below is a simple example of how to create a line chart.

```dart
// Create a list of data points
List<ChartData> data = [
  ChartData(time: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 5)), value: 100),
  ChartData(time: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 4)), value: 110),
  ChartData(time: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 3)), value: 120),
  ChartData(time: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 2)), value: 130),
  ChartData(time: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 1)), value: 140),
  ChartData(time: DateTime.now(), value: 150),
];

// Create a LineChart widget
LineChart(
  data: data,
  // Additional properties can be set here
);
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a simple line chart using the `k_chart_plus` package. You can customize the chart further by exploring the package's documentation.

# Complete Example of k_chart_plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:k_chart_plus/k_chart_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'K Chart Plus Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('K Chart Plus Example'),
        ),
        body: ChartScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ChartScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a list of data points for the chart
    List<ChartData> data = [
      ChartData(time: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 5)), value: 100),
      ChartData(time: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 4)), value: 110),
      ChartData(time: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 3)), value: 120),
      ChartData(time: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 2)), value: 130),
      ChartData(time: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 1)), value: 140),
      ChartData(time: DateTime.now(), value: 150),
    ];

    // Return a LineChart widget with the data
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: LineChart(
        data: data,
        // Customize the chart appearance
        lineColor: Colors.blue,
        pointColor: Colors.red,
        // Additional properties can be set here
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is the ChartScreen widget, which contains the chart.
// 5. In ChartScreen, we create a list of ChartData points representing the data to be displayed.
// 6. We then return a LineChart widget, passing the data and customizing its appearance.
// 7. The LineChart widget renders the chart based on the provided data and customization options.
```
