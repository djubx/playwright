# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `file_testing`

## Installation

To add the `file_testing` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  file_testing: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following lines within the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for file access:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save files.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your documents folder to save files.</string>
```

## Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the `file_testing` package in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the package**:
   ```dart
   import 'package:file_testing/file_testing.dart';
   ```

2. **Read a file**:
   ```dart
   Future<String> readFile(String path) async {
     final file = File(path);
     return await file.readAsString();
   }
   ```

3. **Write to a file**:
   ```dart
   Future<void> writeFile(String path, String content) async {
     final file = File(path);
     await file.writeAsString(content);
   }
   ```

4. **Delete a file**:
   ```dart
   Future<void> deleteFile(String path) async {
     final file = File(path);
     await file.delete();
   }
   ```

By following these steps, you can easily integrate file handling capabilities into your Flutter application using the `file_testing` package.

# Complete Example of Using `file_testing`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:file_testing/file_testing.dart'; // Importing the file_testing package
import 'dart:io'; // Importing dart:io for file operations

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the main app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'File Testing Example',
      home: FileTestScreen(), // Setting the home screen
    );
  }
}

class FileTestScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FileTestScreenState createState() => _FileTestScreenState();
}

class _FileTestScreenState extends State<FileTestScreen> {
  String _fileContent = ''; // Variable to hold file content

  // Method to read file content
  Future<void> _readFile() async {
    String path = 'example.txt'; // Define the file path
    try {
      _fileContent = await readFile(path); // Read the file
      setState(() {}); // Update the UI
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error reading file: $e'); // Handle errors
    }
  }

  // Method to write content to a file
  Future<void> _writeFile() async {
    String path = 'example.txt'; // Define the file path
    String content = 'Hello, Flutter!'; // Content to write
    try {
      await writeFile(path, content); // Write to the file
      print('File written successfully'); // Success message
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error writing file: $e'); // Handle errors
    }
  }

  // Method to delete a file
  Future<void> _deleteFile() async {
    String path = 'example.txt'; // Define the file path
    try {
      await deleteFile(path); // Delete the file
      print('File deleted successfully'); // Success message
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error deleting file: $e'); // Handle errors
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('File Testing Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('File Content: $_fileContent'), // Display file content
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _writeFile, // Write file button
              child: Text('Write to File'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _readFile, // Read file button
              child: Text('Read from File'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _deleteFile, // Delete file button
              child: Text('Delete File'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (FileTestScreen).
// 3. FileTestScreen is a stateful widget that manages the file content and operations.
// 4. The UI consists of buttons to write, read, and delete a file, and a text widget to display the file content.
// 5. When the user presses the "Write to File" button, the _writeFile method is called, which writes "Hello, Flutter!" to 'example.txt'.
// 6. Pressing the "Read from File" button calls the _readFile method, which reads the content of 'example.txt' and updates the UI.
// 7. The "Delete File" button calls the _deleteFile method, which deletes 'example.txt' from the file system.
// 8. The app handles errors gracefully by printing error messages to the console.
