# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the at_contact Package

## Installation

To get started with the `at_contact` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  at_contact: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/at_contact).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow access to contacts:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CONTACTS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission to access contacts:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your contacts.</string>
```

## Basic Usage

Once you have installed the package and configured the necessary permissions, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to retrieve and display contacts.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:at_contact/at_contact.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Contact Management App',
      home: ContactListScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ContactListScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ContactListScreenState createState() => _ContactListScreenState();
}

class _ContactListScreenState extends State<ContactListScreen> {
  List<AtContact> contacts = []; // List to hold contacts

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchContacts(); // Fetch contacts when the screen initializes
  }

  // Function to fetch contacts
  Future<void> _fetchContacts() async {
    try {
      // Retrieve contacts using the at_contact package
      contacts = await AtContact.getContacts();
      setState(() {}); // Update the UI with the fetched contacts
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error fetching contacts: $e"); // Handle any errors
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Contacts'),
      ),
      body: contacts.isEmpty // Check if the contacts list is empty
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: contacts.length, // Number of contacts
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                final contact = contacts[index]; // Get the contact
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(contact.displayName ?? 'No Name'), // Display contact name
                  subtitle: Text(contact.phoneNumber ?? 'No Phone Number'), // Display phone number
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets ContactListScreen as the home.
// 3. ContactListScreen initializes an empty list of contacts and fetches contacts in initState.
// 4. _fetchContacts() retrieves contacts using the at_contact package and updates the state.
// 5. The UI displays a loading indicator while contacts are being fetched.
// 6. Once contacts are retrieved, they are displayed in a ListView, showing the name and phone number.
```
