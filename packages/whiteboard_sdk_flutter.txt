# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using whiteboard_sdk_flutter

## Installation
To get started with the `whiteboard_sdk_flutter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  whiteboard_sdk_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/whiteboard_sdk_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the whiteboard in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:whiteboard_sdk_flutter/whiteboard_sdk_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Whiteboard Example')),
        body: Whiteboard(
          onDrawingChanged: (drawing) {
            // Handle drawing changes
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a whiteboard widget. The `onDrawingChanged` callback allows you to respond to drawing events.

# Complete Example of whiteboard_sdk_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:whiteboard_sdk_flutter/whiteboard_sdk_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Whiteboard SDK Flutter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Collaborative Whiteboard'),
        ),
        body: Whiteboard(
          onDrawingChanged: (drawing) {
            // This callback is triggered whenever the drawing changes
            print('Drawing updated: $drawing');
          },
          // You can customize the whiteboard's appearance here
          backgroundColor: Colors.white,
          penColor: Colors.black,
          penWidth: 2.0,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Collaborative Whiteboard'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold includes the Whiteboard widget.
// 5. The Whiteboard widget has an onDrawingChanged callback that prints the updated drawing to the console.
// 6. The whiteboard is customizable with properties like backgroundColor, penColor, and penWidth.
