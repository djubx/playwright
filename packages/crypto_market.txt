# Setting Up the `crypto_market` Package

## Installation
To use the `crypto_market` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  crypto_market: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access the internet:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Using the Package
Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:crypto_market/crypto_market.dart';
```

You can then create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class to access the features of the package.

# Complete Example of Using the `crypto_market` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:crypto_market/crypto_market.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Crypto Market',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Declare a variable to hold the cryptocurrency data
  List<CryptoCurrency> _cryptoData = [];
  bool _isLoading = true;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Fetch cryptocurrency data when the widget is initialized
    _fetchCryptoData();
  }

  // Function to fetch cryptocurrency data
  Future<void> _fetchCryptoData() async {
    try {
      // Use the crypto_market package to get the data
      final data = await CryptoMarket.getMarketData();
      setState(() {
        _cryptoData = data; // Store the fetched data
        _isLoading = false; // Update loading state
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during data fetching
      print('Error fetching data: $e');
      setState(() {
        _isLoading = false; // Update loading state even on error
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Crypto Market Data'),
      ),
      body: _isLoading
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: _cryptoData.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                final crypto = _cryptoData[index];
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(crypto.name), // Display cryptocurrency name
                  subtitle: Text('Price: \$${crypto.price}'), // Display price
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// 2. `MyApp` sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as `RealFlutter`.
// 3. In `RealFlutter`, we declare a stateful widget to manage the state of the app.
// 4. The `_fetchCryptoData` function is called in `initState` to fetch cryptocurrency data when the widget is initialized.
// 5. The data is fetched using the `CryptoMarket.getMarketData()` method, and the state is updated accordingly.
// 6. While data is being fetched, a loading indicator is displayed.
// 7. Once the data is loaded, a ListView is built to display the names and prices of the cryptocurrencies.
// 8. Each cryptocurrency is displayed as a ListTile in the ListView.
