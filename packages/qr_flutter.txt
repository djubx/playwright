# Setting Up and Using `qr_flutter`

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `qr_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  qr_flutter: ^5.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to use the camera for scanning QR codes. However, for generating QR codes, no additional configuration is required.

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the `qr_flutter` package:

```dart
import 'package:qr_flutter/qr_flutter.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `QrImage` widget to generate and display QR codes. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
QrImage(
  data: "https://www.example.com", // The data to encode
  version: QrVersions.auto, // Automatically choose the version
  size: 200.0, // Size of the QR code
  gapless: false, // Whether to have gaps between the QR code modules
)
```

This widget will generate a QR code that encodes the URL "https://www.example.com".

With these steps, you are now ready to implement QR code generation in your Flutter application using the `qr_flutter` package.

# Complete Example of Using `qr_flutter`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:qr_flutter/qr_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'QR Flutter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('QR Code Generator'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: QrImage(
            data: "https://www.example.com", // The data to encode in the QR code
            version: QrVersions.auto, // Automatically choose the QR code version
            size: 200.0, // Size of the QR code
            gapless: false, // Whether to have gaps between the QR code modules
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget sets up the app with a title and a home page.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The AppBar displays the title "QR Code Generator" at the top of the screen.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 7. Inside the Center widget, the QrImage widget generates a QR code with the specified data (URL).
// 8. The QR code is displayed in the center of the screen with a size of 200.0 pixels.
```
