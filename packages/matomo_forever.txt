# Matomo Forever Flutter Package

## Overview
The **matomo_forever** package is a powerful tool for integrating Matomo analytics into your Flutter applications. Matomo, formerly known as Piwik, is an open-source web analytics platform that provides detailed insights into your website or application's traffic and user behavior. This package allows developers to track user interactions, events, and sessions seamlessly within their Flutter apps.

### When to Use
You should consider using the **matomo_forever** package when:
- You want to implement analytics in your Flutter application without relying on third-party services like Google Analytics.
- You need to maintain user privacy and control over your data, as Matomo can be self-hosted.
- You want to track user behavior, events, and sessions to improve user experience and application performance.

### Features
- **Event Tracking**: Track custom events to understand user interactions better.
- **User Tracking**: Monitor user sessions and behaviors over time.
- **Custom Dimensions**: Set up custom dimensions to segment your data.
- **Self-Hosting**: Host your Matomo instance for complete data control.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS platforms.

## Tutorial: Setting Up Matomo Forever in Flutter

### Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the **matomo_forever** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  matomo_forever: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add internet permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

#### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

### Step 3: Initialize Matomo
In your main application file, initialize the Matomo tracker. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:matomo_forever/matomo_forever.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize Matomo with your Matomo URL and Site ID
    MatomoTracker.initialize(
      url: 'https://your-matomo-instance.com',
      siteId: 1,
    );
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Matomo Forever Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Track Events and User Actions
You can now track events and user actions throughout your app. For example:

```dart
MatomoTracker.trackEvent(
  category: 'Button',
  action: 'Click',
  name: 'Start Button',
);
```

### Step 5: Testing
Run your application on an emulator or physical device. Ensure that events are being tracked by checking your Matomo dashboard.

## Complete Example: Matomo Forever in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:matomo_forever/matomo_forever.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize Matomo with your Matomo URL and Site ID
    MatomoTracker.initialize(
      url: 'https://your-matomo-instance.com', // Your Matomo server URL
      siteId: 1, // Your Matomo site ID
    );
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Matomo Forever Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Matomo Forever Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Track a button click event
            MatomoTracker.trackEvent(
              category: 'Button',
              action: 'Click',
              name: 'Start Button',
            );
            // Navigate to the next screen
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondPage()),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Start'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Second Page'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the second page!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which initializes the Matomo tracker.
// 2. The HomePage widget is displayed, featuring a button labeled "Start."
// 3. When the button is clicked, an event is tracked using MatomoTracker.trackEvent.
// 4. The app then navigates to the SecondPage widget, which displays a welcome message.
// 5. This flow allows you to track user interactions and navigate between screens seamlessly.
