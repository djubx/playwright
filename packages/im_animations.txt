# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using im_animations

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `im_animations` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  im_animations: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:im_animations/im_animations.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Animations

You can now use the animations provided by the package. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a bouncing animation on a button:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:im_animations/im_animations.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('im_animations Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Bounce(
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action on button press
              },
              child: Text('Bounce Me!'),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple Flutter application with a button that bounces when rendered. You can explore other animations provided by the `im_animations` package similarly.

# Complete Example of im_animations in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:im_animations/im_animations.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('im_animations Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using the Bounce animation from the im_animations package
          child: Bounce(
            // The child widget that will bounce
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action to perform when the button is pressed
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Bounce Me!'),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the app's visual layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a Center widget is used to center the Bounce animation.
// 5. The Bounce widget wraps an ElevatedButton, which will animate when rendered.
// 6. When the button is pressed, a SnackBar is displayed at the bottom of the screen, indicating the button was pressed.
// 7. The Bounce animation provides visual feedback, making the app more interactive and engaging.
