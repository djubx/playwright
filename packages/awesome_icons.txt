```

### Using Icons
You can use the icons in your widgets like this:

Icon(
  AwesomeIcons.home,
  size: 30.0,
  color: Colors.blue,
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.

              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a user icon
              Icon(
                AwesomeIcons.user,
                size: 50.0,
