# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Flutter Time Range Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_time_range` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_time_range: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for any necessary permissions, although the `flutter_time_range` package does not require specific permissions.

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_time_range/flutter_time_range.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Time Range Picker

You can now use the `TimeRange` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
TimeRange(
  fromTitle: Text('From'),
  toTitle: Text('To'),
  title: Text('Select Time Range'),
  onRangeCompleted: (range) {
    print('Selected range: ${range.start} - ${range.end}');
  },
)
```

This widget will display a time range picker, and when the user selects a range, it will print the selected start and end times.

## Conclusion

The `flutter_time_range` package is easy to set up and provides a flexible solution for time range selection in Flutter applications. With its customizable UI and straightforward integration, it can significantly enhance the user experience in apps that require time management features.

# Complete Example of Using the Flutter Time Range Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_time_range/flutter_time_range.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Time Range Example',
      home: TimeRangeExample(),
    );
  }
}

class TimeRangeExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TimeRangeExampleState createState() => _TimeRangeExampleState();
}

class _TimeRangeExampleState extends State<TimeRangeExample> {
  // Variable to hold the selected time range
  TimeRange? _selectedTimeRange;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Time Range Picker Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected time range
            Text(
              _selectedTimeRange != null
                  ? 'Selected Range: ${_selectedTimeRange!.start} - ${_selectedTimeRange!.end}'
                  : 'No Range Selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // TimeRange widget for selecting time
            TimeRange(
              fromTitle: Text('From'),
              toTitle: Text('To'),
              title: Text('Select Time Range'),
              onRangeCompleted: (range) {
                // Update the state with the selected time range
                setState(() {
                  _selectedTimeRange = range;
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. TimeRangeExample is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the selected time range.
// 4. In the build method, we create a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 5. The Column displays the currently selected time range or a message indicating no range is selected.
// 6. The TimeRange widget is included, which allows users to select a time range.
// 7. When a range is selected, the onRangeCompleted callback updates the state with the selected range, triggering a rebuild to display the new selection.
```

// Final Summary:
// The application starts by initializing the `RealFlutter` widget, which sets up the main structure of the app. The `TimeRangeExample` widget manages the state of the selected time range. When the user selects a time range using the `TimeRange` widget, the selected range is stored in the `_selectedTimeRange` variable, and the UI updates to reflect the current selection. This flow provides a seamless experience for users to select and view their chosen time range.
