# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using rflutter_alert

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `rflutter_alert` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rflutter_alert: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:rflutter_alert/rflutter_alert.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using rflutter_alert

### Basic Usage

You can create a simple alert dialog using the following code snippet:

```dart
Alert(
  context: context,
  title: "Alert Title",
  desc: "This is a simple alert description.",
).show();
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your app's theme supports Material Design. The `rflutter_alert` package will automatically adapt to the theme.
- **iOS**: The package will use Cupertino-style dialogs if your app is running on iOS, providing a native look and feel.

### Customization Options

You can customize the alert dialog with various options, such as adding buttons, changing colors, and more. Hereâ€™s an example of a confirmation dialog:

```dart
Alert(
  context: context,
  title: "Confirm Action",
  desc: "Are you sure you want to proceed?",
  buttons: [
    DialogButton(
      child: Text(
        "Cancel",
        style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
      ),
      onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context),
      color: Colors.red,
    ),
    DialogButton(
      child: Text(
        "Proceed",
        style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
      ),
      onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context),
      color: Colors.green,
    )
  ],
).show();
```

This code creates a confirmation dialog with two buttons: "Cancel" and "Proceed".

## Step 4: Additional Configurations

For optimal performance, ensure that your Flutter SDK is up to date. You can check for updates using:

```bash
flutter upgrade
```

Also, consider testing your alerts on both Android and iOS devices to ensure consistent behavior and appearance.

# Complete Example of rflutter_alert

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rflutter_alert/rflutter_alert.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'RFlutter Alert Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('RFlutter Alert Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the alert when the button is pressed
              Alert(
                context: context,
                title: "Welcome!",
                desc: "This is a demo of the rflutter_alert package.",
                buttons: [
                  DialogButton(
                    child: Text(
                      "OK",
                      style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                    ),
                    onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context),
                    color: Colors.blue,
                  )
                ],
              ).show();
            },
            child: Text('Show Alert'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, an alert dialog is triggered using the Alert class from rflutter_alert.
// 5. The alert displays a title and description, along with an "OK" button to dismiss the dialog.
// 6. Pressing the "OK" button calls Navigator.pop(context) to close the alert and return to the main screen.
```
