# Tuanis Sidebar Setup and Usage Tutorial

To get started with the **tuanis_sidebar** package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tuanis_sidebar: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/tuanis_sidebar).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the **tuanis_sidebar** package, you can create a simple sidebar layout in your Flutter application. Below is a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tuanis_sidebar/tuanis_sidebar.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: TuanisSidebar(
          items: [
            SidebarItem(icon: Icons.home, title: 'Home'),
            SidebarItem(icon: Icons.settings, title: 'Settings'),
            SidebarItem(icon: Icons.info, title: 'About'),
          ],
          onItemSelected: (index) {
            // Handle item selection
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple sidebar with three items: Home, Settings, and About. The `onItemSelected` callback allows you to handle user interactions with the sidebar items.

With this setup, you can easily customize the sidebar to fit your app's needs.

# Complete Example of Tuanis Sidebar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tuanis_sidebar/tuanis_sidebar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tuanis Sidebar Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Tuanis Sidebar Example'),
        ),
        body: TuanisSidebar(
          items: [
            SidebarItem(icon: Icons.home, title: 'Home'),
            SidebarItem(icon: Icons.settings, title: 'Settings'),
            SidebarItem(icon: Icons.info, title: 'About'),
          ],
          onItemSelected: (index) {
            // Handle item selection
            // You can navigate to different pages based on the selected index
            switch (index) {
              case 0:
                // Navigate to Home
                break;
              case 1:
                // Navigate to Settings
                break;
              case 2:
                // Navigate to About
                break;
            }
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter as the root widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Tuanis Sidebar Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a TuanisSidebar widget.
// 5. The TuanisSidebar is populated with three SidebarItem widgets: Home, Settings, and About.
// 6. The onItemSelected callback is triggered when a sidebar item is tapped.
// 7. Inside the callback, a switch statement determines which action to take based on the selected index.
// 8. You can implement navigation logic to switch between different pages or functionalities based on the selected item.
