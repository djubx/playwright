# Overview of the bip32_bip44 Flutter Package

The `bip32_bip44` package is a Flutter library designed for handling BIP32 and BIP44 standards, which are essential for hierarchical deterministic wallets. This package allows developers to create and manage wallets that can generate multiple addresses from a single seed, making it particularly useful for cryptocurrency applications.

## When to Use This Package
- **Cryptocurrency Wallets**: If you're building a wallet application that needs to manage multiple addresses securely.
- **Blockchain Applications**: For applications that require address generation and management based on BIP standards.
- **Secure Key Management**: When you need to derive keys in a secure and deterministic manner.

## Key Features
- **BIP32 Support**: Generate child keys from a master key using the BIP32 standard.
- **BIP44 Compliance**: Follow the BIP44 standard for multi-coin wallets, allowing for the management of different cryptocurrencies.
- **Hierarchical Key Structure**: Create a tree of keys that can be used for various purposes, enhancing security and organization.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using bip32_bip44

## Installation
To use the `bip32_bip44` package in your Flutter project, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  bip32_bip44: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if you plan to access secure storage or network resources.

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `bip32_bip44` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:bip32_bip44/bip32_bip44.dart';
   ```

2. Create a new wallet:
   ```dart
   final wallet = RealFlutter();
   ```

3. Generate a master key and derive child keys:
   ```dart
   // Generate a random seed
   final seed = wallet.generateSeed();
   // Create a master key from the seed
   final masterKey = wallet.createMasterKey(seed);
   // Derive a child key
   final childKey = wallet.deriveChildKey(masterKey, "m/44'/0'/0'/0/0");
   ```

This setup allows you to create a secure wallet that can manage multiple addresses derived from a single seed.

# Complete Example of Using bip32_bip44

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bip32_bip44/bip32_bip44.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'BIP32 BIP44 Example',
      home: WalletScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class WalletScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WalletScreenState createState() => _WalletScreenState();
}

class _WalletScreenState extends State<WalletScreen> {
  late RealFlutter wallet; // Declare the wallet instance
  String? address; // Variable to hold the generated address

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    wallet = RealFlutter(); // Initialize the wallet
    generateAddress(); // Generate an address on startup
  }

  void generateAddress() {
    // Generate a random seed
    final seed = wallet.generateSeed();
    // Create a master key from the seed
    final masterKey = wallet.createMasterKey(seed);
    // Derive a child key for Bitcoin
    final childKey = wallet.deriveChildKey(masterKey, "m/44'/0'/0'/0/0");
    // Get the address from the child key
    address = wallet.getAddress(childKey);
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI with the new address
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('BIP32 BIP44 Wallet'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          address != null ? 'Generated Address: $address' : 'Generating Address...',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: generateAddress, // Regenerate address on button press
        tooltip: 'Generate New Address',
        child: Icon(Icons.refresh),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets WalletScreen as the home.
// 3. WalletScreen initializes the RealFlutter wallet instance in initState.
// 4. The generateAddress method is called to create a new wallet address.
// 5. A random seed is generated, and a master key is created from it.
// 6. A child key is derived using the BIP44 path for Bitcoin.
// 7. The address is extracted from the child key and displayed on the screen.
// 8. The floating action button allows users to generate a new address on demand.
