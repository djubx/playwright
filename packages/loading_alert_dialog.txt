# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Loading Alert Dialog

## Installation

To use the `loading_alert_dialog` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  loading_alert_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup

To use the loading alert dialog, you need to import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:loading_alert_dialog/loading_alert_dialog.dart';
```

### Displaying the Dialog

You can display the loading dialog by calling the `showLoadingDialog` method. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```dart
void _performTask(BuildContext context) async {
  // Show the loading dialog
  showLoadingDialog(context);

  // Simulate a network call or long-running task
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));

  // Dismiss the loading dialog
  Navigator.of(context).pop();
}
```

### Platform-Specific Considerations

- **Android**: Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions if you are performing network operations.
- **iOS**: Make sure to handle any specific configurations in your `Info.plist` if you are accessing the internet.

### Customization

You can customize the dialog by passing parameters to the `showLoadingDialog` method, such as `title`, `message`, and `backgroundColor`.

```dart
showLoadingDialog(
  context,
  title: 'Loading',
  message: 'Please wait while we fetch data...',
  backgroundColor: Colors.blueAccent,
);
```

This allows you to tailor the loading dialog to fit your app's design and user experience.

# Complete Example of Loading Alert Dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:loading_alert_dialog/loading_alert_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Loading Alert Dialog Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Loading Alert Dialog Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () => _performTask(context), // Trigger the loading dialog
            child: Text('Start Task'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _performTask(BuildContext context) async {
    // Show the loading dialog
    showLoadingDialog(context, title: 'Loading', message: 'Please wait...');

    // Simulate a network call or long-running task
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));

    // Dismiss the loading dialog
    Navigator.of(context).pop();
  }
}
```

// The above code defines a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the loading_alert_dialog package.
// 
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app and sets `RealFlutter` as the home widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` class builds a MaterialApp with a title and a simple UI containing a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the `_performTask` method is called.
// 4. Inside `_performTask`, the loading dialog is displayed using `showLoadingDialog`.
// 5. A simulated delay of 3 seconds represents a long-running task (like a network call).
// 6. After the delay, the loading dialog is dismissed using `Navigator.of(context).pop()`.
// 
// This flow provides a clear user experience by indicating that a task is in progress and preventing user actions until the task is complete.
