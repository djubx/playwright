# Tutorial: Setting Up PayPal Login in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `paypal_login` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `paypal_login` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  paypal_login: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and add the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest>
    ...
    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.paypal.sdk.paypalAppId"
            android:value="YOUR_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>YOUR_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

2. Ensure you have the required permissions in your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have configured the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. 

### Example Code
You can use the following code snippet to implement PayPal login:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:paypal_login/paypal_login.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PayPal Login Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initiate PayPal login
              var result = await PayPalLogin.login();
              if (result != null) {
                // Handle successful login
                print('Logged in as: ${result.email}');
              } else {
                // Handle login failure
                print('Login failed');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Login with PayPal'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application with a button that initiates the PayPal login process.

# Complete Example of PayPal Login

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:paypal_login/paypal_login.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('PayPal Login Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initiate PayPal login
              var result = await PayPalLogin.login();
              if (result != null) {
                // Handle successful login
                print('Logged in as: ${result.email}');
              } else {
                // Handle login failure
                print('Login failed');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Login with PayPal'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the app structure.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the PayPal login process is initiated using PayPalLogin.login().
// 6. If the login is successful, the user's email is printed to the console.
// 7. If the login fails, a failure message is printed to the console.
