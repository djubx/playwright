# R Tree Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The `r_tree` package is a powerful spatial data structure implementation for Flutter, designed to efficiently manage and query spatial data. It is particularly useful for applications that require fast access to geographical or spatial information, such as mapping applications, games, and augmented reality experiences.

## When to Use R Tree
You should consider using the `r_tree` package when:
- You need to store and query large sets of spatial data efficiently.
- Your application involves geographical data, such as points of interest, routes, or regions.
- You require fast insertion, deletion, and querying of spatial objects.

## Key Features
- **Efficient Spatial Queries**: The R Tree structure allows for quick searching of spatial data, making it ideal for applications that require real-time data access.
- **Dynamic Insertion and Deletion**: Easily add or remove spatial objects without significant performance degradation.
- **Bounding Box Queries**: Perform queries based on bounding boxes, which is useful for determining which objects intersect with a given area.

Overall, the `r_tree` package is a robust solution for managing spatial data in Flutter applications, providing both performance and flexibility.

# R Tree Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the `r_tree` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  r_tree: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `r_tree` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional platform-specific configurations required for basic usage. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

## Basic Usage
To use the `r_tree` package, you will typically follow these steps:
1. Import the package in your Dart file.
2. Create an instance of the R Tree.
3. Insert spatial objects into the R Tree.
4. Perform queries to retrieve spatial objects based on specific criteria.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `r_tree` package:

```dart
import 'package:r_tree/r_tree.dart';

void main() {
  // Create an instance of RTree
  final rTree = RTree<int>();

  // Insert some spatial objects (represented as bounding boxes)
  rTree.insert(Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, 10, 10), 1); // Object 1
  rTree.insert(Rect.fromLTWH(5, 5, 10, 10), 2); // Object 2
  rTree.insert(Rect.fromLTWH(15, 15, 10, 10), 3); // Object 3

  // Query for objects that intersect with a given bounding box
  final results = rTree.query(Rect.fromLTWH(5, 5, 10, 10));
  print(results); // Should return objects that intersect with the bounding box
}
```

This example demonstrates the basic setup and usage of the `r_tree` package. You can expand upon this by adding more complex spatial queries and handling various types of spatial data.

# Complete Example of R Tree in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:r_tree/r_tree.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'R Tree Example',
      home: RTreeDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class RTreeDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RTreeDemoState createState() => _RTreeDemoState();
}

class _RTreeDemoState extends State<RTreeDemo> {
  // Create an instance of RTree
  final RTree<int> rTree = RTree<int>();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Insert some spatial objects (represented as bounding boxes)
    rTree.insert(Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, 10, 10), 1); // Object 1
    rTree.insert(Rect.fromLTWH(5, 5, 10, 10), 2); // Object 2
    rTree.insert(Rect.fromLTWH(15, 15, 10, 10), 3); // Object 3
  }

  void _performQuery() {
    // Query for objects that intersect with a given bounding box
    final results = rTree.query(Rect.fromLTWH(5, 5, 10, 10));
    // Display the results in a dialog
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
        title: Text('Query Results'),
        content: Text('Intersecting Objects: $results'),
        actions: [
          TextButton(
            onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
            child: Text('Close'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('R Tree Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _performQuery,
          child: Text('Perform Query'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to RTreeDemo.
// 3. RTreeDemo is a StatefulWidget that initializes an RTree instance in its state.
// 4. In the initState method, three spatial objects are inserted into the RTree.
// 5. The build method creates a button that, when pressed, triggers the _performQuery method.
// 6. The _performQuery method queries the RTree for objects intersecting with a specified bounding box.
// 7. The results are displayed in a dialog box, showing which objects intersect with the query area.
