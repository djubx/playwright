// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user clicks the 'Generate Coverage Reports' button to generate coverage reports.
// 2. The generateCoverageReports function is called to run all tests with coverage enabled.
// 3. The user clicks the 'Merge Coverage Reports' button to merge the coverage reports.
// 4. The mergeCoverageReports function is called to use the combineCoverage function to merge the coverage reports.
// 5. The combined coverage report is output to the specified directory.

// In summary, this code provides a simple example of how to use the combine_coverage package to merge coverage reports.
// The application flow is straightforward, with two buttons to generate and merge coverage reports, respectively.
