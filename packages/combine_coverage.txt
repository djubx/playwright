# Overview of the combine_coverage Flutter Package

The `combine_coverage` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to combine multiple code coverage reports into a single report. This is particularly useful in large projects where tests are distributed across multiple files or modules, allowing developers to get a comprehensive view of their code coverage.

## When to Use `combine_coverage`

- **Multiple Test Files**: When your Flutter project has multiple test files and you want to aggregate their coverage reports.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: In Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) environments, where you need to generate a unified coverage report after running tests.
- **Improving Code Quality**: To ensure that all parts of your codebase are adequately tested and to identify untested areas.

## Key Features

- **Aggregation of Coverage Reports**: Combines multiple coverage reports into one, making it easier to analyze overall test coverage.
- **Support for Different Formats**: Works with various coverage formats, allowing flexibility in how reports are generated.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter projects with minimal configuration.

By using `combine_coverage`, developers can streamline their testing process and gain better insights into their code quality.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using combine_coverage

## Installation

To get started with `combine_coverage`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  combine_coverage: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `build.gradle` file is configured to generate coverage reports. You may need to add the following to your `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    testOptions {
        unitTests.all {
            it.useJUnitPlatform()
        }
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your Xcode project is set up to generate coverage reports. You can enable code coverage in your Xcode scheme settings.

## Using combine_coverage

Once installed, you can use `combine_coverage` in your terminal to combine coverage reports. Hereâ€™s a basic command to combine reports:

```bash
flutter test --coverage
combine_coverage coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/combined.info
```

This command runs your tests and generates a coverage report, which is then combined into a single report.

# Complete Example of Using combine_coverage

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:combine_coverage/combine_coverage.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Combine Coverage Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Combine Coverage Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // This button simulates running tests and generating coverage
              _runTestsAndCombineCoverage();
            },
            child: Text('Run Tests and Combine Coverage'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _runTestsAndCombineCoverage() {
    // This function would typically run your tests and generate coverage
    // For demonstration, we will just print a message
    print('Running tests and generating coverage...');
    
    // Simulate coverage report generation
    // In a real scenario, you would run the command to generate coverage
    // and then combine it using combine_coverage
    print('Combining coverage reports...');
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a button.
// 3. When the button is pressed, it calls _runTestsAndCombineCoverage.
// 4. The _runTestsAndCombineCoverage function simulates running tests and combining coverage reports.
// 5. In a real application, this function would execute the necessary commands to generate and combine coverage reports.
```

// Final Summary:
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that integrates the `combine_coverage` package. The app consists of a button that, when pressed, simulates the process of running tests and combining coverage reports. The comments within the code explain each step of the application flow, making it easy to understand how the package can be utilized in a real-world scenario.
