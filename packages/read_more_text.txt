# Overview of the `read_more_text` Flutter Package

The `read_more_text` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance their text display capabilities. This package allows you to create expandable text widgets that can show a limited amount of text initially and expand to reveal more content when the user interacts with it. This is particularly useful for applications that need to display lengthy content, such as articles, product descriptions, or user comments, without overwhelming the user interface.

## When to Use `read_more_text`

- **Content Management**: When displaying articles or blog posts where only a summary is needed initially.
- **User Comments**: In social media applications, where users can expand comments to read more.
- **Product Descriptions**: In e-commerce apps, to show a brief description with an option to read more.

## Features

- **Customizable Text**: You can customize the text that appears when the content is expanded or collapsed.
- **Animation Support**: Smooth animations when expanding or collapsing the text.
- **Flexible Styling**: Supports various text styles, making it easy to integrate into your app's design.

Overall, the `read_more_text` package is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to improve user experience by managing text display effectively.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `read_more_text`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `read_more_text` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  read_more_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the `ReadMoreText` widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:read_more_text/read_more_text.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Read More Text Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: ReadMoreText(
            'This is a long text that will be truncated initially. '
            'When the user clicks on "Read more", the full text will be displayed.',
            trimLines: 2, // Number of lines to show before truncating
            colorClickableText: Colors.blue,
            trimMode: TrimMode.Line,
            trimCollapsedText: '...Read more',
            trimExpandedText: ' Show less',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ReadMoreText` widget is used to display a long text that can be expanded or collapsed. The `trimLines` property controls how many lines are shown before truncation, and the `trimCollapsedText` and `trimExpandedText` properties allow you to customize the text that appears when the content is collapsed or expanded.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `read_more_text` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Using `read_more_text`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:read_more_text/read_more_text.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Read More Text Example')),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: ReadMoreText(
            'This is a long text that will be truncated initially. '
            'When the user clicks on "Read more", the full text will be displayed. '
            'This feature is particularly useful for displaying lengthy content in a user-friendly manner. '
            'Users can choose to expand the text to read more or collapse it to save space.',
            trimLines: 2, // Show only 2 lines before truncating
            colorClickableText: Colors.blue, // Color for the clickable text
            trimMode: TrimMode.Line, // Mode for trimming the text
            trimCollapsedText: '...Read more', // Text to show when collapsed
            trimExpandedText: ' Show less', // Text to show when expanded
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16), // Text style
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title "Read More Text Example".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Padding widget to add space around the ReadMoreText widget.
// 5. The ReadMoreText widget displays a long text that is initially truncated to 2 lines.
// 6. Users can click on "Read more" to expand the text and see the full content.
// 7. The text can be collapsed again by clicking "Show less", providing a seamless user experience.
