# Complete Example of Using nholiday_jp

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nholiday_jp/nholiday_jp.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Japanese Holidays',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HolidayListScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HolidayListScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HolidayListScreenState createState() => _HolidayListScreenState();
}

class _HolidayListScreenState extends State<HolidayListScreen> {
  List<Holiday> _holidays = []; // List to store holiday data
  bool _isLoading = true; // Loading state

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchHolidays(); // Fetch holidays when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to fetch holidays for the year 2023
  Future<void> _fetchHolidays() async {
    try {
      _holidays = await RealFlutter.getHolidays(year: 2023); // Fetch holidays
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error fetching holidays: $e'); // Handle any errors
    } finally {
      setState(() {
        _isLoading = false; // Update loading state
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Japanese Holidays 2023'),
      ),
      body: _isLoading
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: _holidays.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                final holiday = _holidays[index];
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(holiday.name), // Display holiday name
                  subtitle: Text(holiday.date.toString()), // Display holiday date
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets HolidayListScreen as the home.
// 3. HolidayListScreen is a stateful widget that fetches holiday data when initialized.
// 4. The _fetchHolidays method retrieves holidays for the year 2023 and updates the state.
// 5. While loading, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 6. Once the data is fetched, a ListView displays the list of holidays with their names and dates.
