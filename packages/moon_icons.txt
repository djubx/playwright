# Tutorial: Setting Up Moon Icons

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the moon_icons package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the moon_icons package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  moon_icons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the moon_icons package:

```dart
import 'package:moon_icons/moon_icons.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Moon Icons
You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use an icon in a `IconButton`:

```dart
IconButton(
  icon: Icon(MoonIcons.home),
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you are using any features that require permissions. However, using moon_icons does not require any special permissions.

## Optimizations
- Consider using the `IconTheme` widget to manage the color and size of icons throughout your app for a consistent look.

# Complete Example of Moon Icons in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:moon_icons/moon_icons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Moon Icons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Moon Icons Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a home icon
              Icon(
                MoonIcons.home,
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a settings icon
              Icon(
                MoonIcons.settings,
                size: 50.0,
                color: Colors.green,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Displaying a user icon
              Icon(
                MoonIcons.user,
                size: 50.0,
                color: Colors.red,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action to perform when the button is pressed
          },
          child: Icon(MoonIcons.add), // Using an add icon for the button
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Moon Icons Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, three icons (home, settings, user) are displayed with different colors and sizes.
// 6. A FloatingActionButton is added at the bottom, which uses the add icon from moon_icons.
// 7. The app is structured to be simple and demonstrates the use of moon_icons effectively.
