# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Assorted Layout Widgets

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the assorted_layout_widgets package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  assorted_layout_widgets: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/assorted_layout_widgets).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using the assorted layout widgets:

```dart
import 'package:assorted_layout_widgets/assorted_layout_widgets.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Widgets

You can now use the assorted layout widgets in your Flutter application. For example, you can use the `Wrap` widget to create a responsive layout that wraps its children based on the available space.

```dart
Wrap(
  spacing: 8.0, // Horizontal space between children
  runSpacing: 4.0, // Vertical space between runs
  children: <Widget>[
    // Add your widgets here
  ],
);
```

This is just a basic example. The package includes various other widgets that can be utilized to create more complex layouts.

# Complete Example of Using Assorted Layout Widgets

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:assorted_layout_widgets/assorted_layout_widgets.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Assorted Layout Widgets Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Assorted Layout Widgets'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Wrap(
            spacing: 8.0, // Space between items horizontally
            runSpacing: 4.0, // Space between items vertically
            children: <Widget>[
              Container(
                color: Colors.red,
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                child: Center(child: Text('Item 1')),
              ),
              Container(
                color: Colors.green,
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                child: Center(child: Text('Item 2')),
              ),
              Container(
                color: Colors.blue,
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                child: Center(child: Text('Item 3')),
              ),
              Container(
                color: Colors.yellow,
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                child: Center(child: Text('Item 4')),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Assorted Layout Widgets'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Wrap widget.
// 5. The Wrap widget arranges its children (colored containers) in a responsive manner.
// 6. Each container has a fixed width and height, and they are spaced out using the spacing and runSpacing properties.
// 7. The application demonstrates how to use the assorted layout widgets to create a flexible and responsive UI.
