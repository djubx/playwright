# System Date Time Format Flutter Package

The `system_date_time_format` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers format date and time according to the user's locale and system settings. This package is particularly useful in applications that require date and time display, ensuring that the format aligns with the user's preferences and regional settings.

## When to Use This Package

- **User Preferences**: If your application allows users to set their preferred date and time formats, this package can help you implement that feature seamlessly.
- **Dynamic Formatting**: When you need to format dates and times dynamically based on the system settings, ensuring consistency across different devices.

## Features

- **Locale-Aware Formatting**: Automatically formats date and time based on the user's locale.
- **Customizable Options**: Allows developers to specify custom formats if needed.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the System Date Time Format Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `system_date_time_format` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  system_date_time_format: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to support localization. Add the following key to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
<array>
    <string>en</string>
    <string>fr</string>
    <string>de</string>
    <!-- Add other languages as needed -->
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to format the current date and time:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:system_date_time_format/system_date_time_format.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current date and time
    DateTime now = DateTime.now();

    // Format the date and time using the package
    String formattedDate = SystemDateTimeFormat.formatDateTime(now);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Date Time Format Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Current Date and Time: $formattedDate',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we import the necessary packages, get the current date and time, and format it using the `SystemDateTimeFormat` class. The formatted date and time are then displayed in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of Using the System Date Time Format Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:system_date_time_format/system_date_time_format.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Step 1: Get the current date and time
    DateTime now = DateTime.now();

    // Step 2: Format the date and time using the package
    String formattedDate = SystemDateTimeFormat.formatDateTime(now);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Date Time Format Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Current Date and Time: $formattedDate',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // Step 3: Run the app
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, we get the current date and time using DateTime.now().
// 4. We then format this date and time using the SystemDateTimeFormat.formatDateTime() method.
// 5. The formatted date and time are displayed in a Text widget at the center of the screen.
// 6. Finally, the app is run using runApp(), which takes an instance of RealFlutter.
```
