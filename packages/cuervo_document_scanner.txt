// This is the main entry point of the app.
// We create a MaterialApp with a title and a theme.
// We then create a MyHomePage widget, which is a stateful widget.
// In the build method of MyHomePage, we create a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// In the body, we center a CuervoDocumentScanner widget.
// When the user scans a document, the onScan callback is called with the scanned document.
// We can then process the scanned document as needed.

// To use this code, simply copy and paste it into a new Flutter project.
// Make sure to add the cuervo_document_scanner package to your pubspec.yaml file.
// Then, run the app on a device or emulator to test it.
