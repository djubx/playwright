# Setting Up the Face Pile Package
To use the face_pile package, you'll need to add it to your Flutter project. Here's how:

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line:
```yml
dependencies:
  face_pile: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to get the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
The face_pile package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to add some platform-specific configurations to get it working properly.

### Android
On Android, you'll need to add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```
This permission is required to load images from the internet.

### iOS
On iOS, you'll need to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```
This configuration allows the app to load images from the internet.

## Using the Face Pile Package
To use the face_pile package, you'll need to import it into your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:face_pile/face_pile.dart';
```
Then, you can use the `FacePile` widget to display a stack of faces:
```dart
FacePile(
  faces: [
    Face(
      image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image1.jpg'),
    ),
    Face(
      image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image2.jpg'),
    ),
    Face(
      image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image3.jpg'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

                // You can customize the face size and spacing here
                size: 50,
                spacing: 10,
              ),
              Face(
                image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image2.jpg'),
                size: 50,
                spacing: 10,
              ),
              Face(
                image: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image3.jpg'),
                size: 50,
                spacing: 10,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Here's a step-by-step explanation of the app flow:
// 1. The app starts by running the `main` function, which creates a new instance of the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a `MaterialApp` with a `Scaffold` as its home.
// 3. The `Scaffold` has an `AppBar` with a title, and a `Center` widget as its body.
// 4. The `Center` widget contains a `FacePile` widget, which displays a stack of faces.
// 5. The `FacePile` widget takes a list of `Face` widgets as its children.
// 6. Each `Face` widget has an `image` property, which is a `NetworkImage` that loads an image from the internet.
// 7. The `Face` widget also has `size` and `spacing` properties, which can be customized to change the appearance of the face.
// 8. The `FacePile` widget uses the `size` and `spacing` properties to position the faces in a stack.
// 9. The app displays the `FacePile` widget in the center of the screen, with the faces stacked on top of each other.

// Summary: The app uses the `face_pile` package to display a stack of faces, with customizable size and spacing. The faces are loaded from the internet using `NetworkImage`.
