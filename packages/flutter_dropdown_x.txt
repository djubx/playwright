# flutter_dropdown_x: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with `flutter_dropdown_x`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_dropdown_x: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dropdown_x).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your dropdown interacts with any device features.

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to implement a simple dropdown using `flutter_dropdown_x`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_dropdown_x/flutter_dropdown_x.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dropdown Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: DropdownX(
            items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Handle the selected value
              print('Selected: $value');
            },
            hint: 'Select an option',
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple dropdown with three options. The `onChanged` callback is triggered whenever the user selects an option.

# Complete Example of flutter_dropdown_x

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_dropdown_x/flutter_dropdown_x.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dropdown Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: DropdownX(
            items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'], // List of options for the dropdown
            onChanged: (value) {
              // This callback is triggered when an option is selected
              print('Selected: $value'); // Print the selected value to the console
            },
            hint: 'Select an option', // Placeholder text when no option is selected
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the application with the RealFlutter widget
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Dropdown Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. The child of the Center widget is a DropdownX widget.
// 6. The DropdownX widget is initialized with a list of items and a hint.
// 7. When the user selects an option, the onChanged callback is triggered, printing the selected value to the console.
