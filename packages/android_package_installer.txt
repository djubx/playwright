# Android Package Installer Flutter Package

The `android_package_installer` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to install APK files directly from their Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that need to manage their own updates or install additional features without requiring users to navigate to the Play Store. 

## When to Use This Package
- **Custom App Distribution**: If you are distributing your app outside of the Play Store, this package allows you to install APKs directly.
- **In-App Updates**: For apps that require frequent updates, you can use this package to install new versions of your app seamlessly.
- **Feature Modules**: If your app has optional features that can be installed on demand, this package can help manage those installations.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: While primarily focused on Android, the package provides a consistent API for both Android and iOS.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and usage within your Flutter application.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling to manage installation failures gracefully.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Android Package Installer

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `android_package_installer` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  android_package_installer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. **Permissions**: You need to add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INSTALL_PACKAGES"/>
   ```

2. **Target SDK**: Ensure your `targetSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to 26 or higher:

   ```groovy
   android {
       compileSdkVersion 31
       defaultConfig {
           targetSdkVersion 31
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration
Currently, the `android_package_installer` package is primarily designed for Android. For iOS, you may need to handle app distribution through the App Store or TestFlight.

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to install an APK:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:android_package_installer/android_package_installer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('APK Installer Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Specify the path to the APK file
              String apkPath = 'path/to/your/app.apk';
              
              // Attempt to install the APK
              try {
                await AndroidPackageInstaller.install(apkPath);
                // Notify the user of success
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('APK installed successfully!')),
                );
              } catch (e) {
                // Handle any errors during installation
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Failed to install APK: $e')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Install APK'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Using the Android Package Installer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:android_package_installer/android_package_installer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('APK Installer Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Specify the path to the APK file
              String apkPath = 'path/to/your/app.apk';
              
              // Attempt to install the APK
              try {
                await AndroidPackageInstaller.install(apkPath);
                // Notify the user of success
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('APK installed successfully!')),
                );
              } catch (e) {
                // Handle any errors during installation
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Failed to install APK: $e')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Install APK'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, triggers the APK installation process.
// 4. The path to the APK file is specified.
// 5. The AndroidPackageInstaller's install method is called with the APK path.
// 6. If the installation is successful, a SnackBar is shown to inform the user.
// 7. If an error occurs during installation, an error message is displayed in a SnackBar.
```
