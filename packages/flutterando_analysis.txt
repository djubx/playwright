// The app's flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with a UI that includes three buttons.
// 2. When the user presses the "Track User Interaction" button, the `trackUserInteraction` method is called, which uses the package to track a user interaction.
// 3. When the user presses the "Collect Performance Data" button, the `collectPerformanceData` method is called, which uses the package to collect performance data.
// 4. When the user presses the "Report Crash" button, the `reportCrash` method is called, which uses the package to report a crash.
// 5. The package collects data on the user's interactions, performance, and crashes, and provides insights and analytics to help improve the app.
