# Complete Example of Star Menu in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:star_menu/star_menu.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Star Menu Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Star Menu Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: StarMenu(
            items: [
              StarMenuItem(
                icon: Icons.home,
                label: 'Home',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle Home action
                  print('Home tapped');
                },
              ),
              StarMenuItem(
                icon: Icons.settings,
                label: 'Settings',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle Settings action
                  print('Settings tapped');
                },
              ),
              StarMenuItem(
                icon: Icons.info,
                label: 'About',
                onTap: () {
                  // Handle About action
                  print('About tapped');
                },
              ),
            ],
            // Customize the menu appearance and behavior
            radius: 100.0, // Radius of the star menu
            animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 300), // Animation duration
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Star Menu Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, a StarMenu widget is created with three menu items: Home, Settings, and About.
// 5. Each menu item has an icon, a label, and an onTap function that prints a message to the console when tapped.
// 6. The StarMenu is customizable with properties like radius and animation duration, enhancing the user experience.
