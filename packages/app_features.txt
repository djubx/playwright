# Setting Up and Using the app_features Package

## Installation
To add the `app_features` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  app_features: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Basic Usage
To use the features provided by the `app_features` package, you can import it into your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:app_features/app_features.dart';
```

You can then utilize the various components, such as authentication and notifications, as per your app's requirements.

# Complete Example of Using app_features

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:app_features/app_features.dart'; // Importing the app_features package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'App Features Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(), // Setting the home screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _message = 'Welcome to App Features Demo!'; // Initial message

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize any features you need, like notifications or analytics
    AppFeatures.initialize(); // Initializing app features
  }

  void _login() {
    // Simulating a login process
    AppFeatures.authenticateUser('username', 'password').then((result) {
      if (result) {
        setState(() {
          _message = 'Login Successful!'; // Update message on successful login
        });
      } else {
        setState(() {
          _message = 'Login Failed!'; // Update message on failed login
        });
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(_message), // Displaying the message
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _login, // Triggering login on button press
              child: Text('Login'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen initializes the app features in its initState method.
// 4. When the user presses the "Login" button, the _login method is called.
// 5. The _login method calls the authenticateUser method from the app_features package.
// 6. Based on the result of the authentication, the message displayed on the screen is updated accordingly.
