# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Native Dialog Plus

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started with `native_dialog_plus`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  native_dialog_plus: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if you plan to use features that require them. Typically, no additional configuration is needed for basic dialog usage.

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your dialogs require access to certain features (like camera or location). However, for standard dialogs, no additional configuration is required.

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the `native_dialog_plus` package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a basic alert dialog.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_dialog_plus/native_dialog_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Native Dialog Plus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show a native alert dialog
              NativeDialogPlus.showAlertDialog(
                context: context,
                title: 'Alert',
                message: 'This is a native alert dialog!',
                onConfirm: () {
                  // Handle confirmation action
                  Navigator.of(context).pop();
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Alert'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a native alert dialog is displayed with a title and message. The dialog has a confirmation button that dismisses the dialog when pressed.

# Complete Example of Native Dialog Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:native_dialog_plus/native_dialog_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Native Dialog Plus Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show a native alert dialog
              NativeDialogPlus.showAlertDialog(
                context: context,
                title: 'Alert',
                message: 'This is a native alert dialog!',
                onConfirm: () {
                  // Handle confirmation action
                  Navigator.of(context).pop();
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Alert'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the overall structure of the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the basic visual layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers the display of a native alert dialog.
// 6. The NativeDialogPlus.showAlertDialog method is called, passing the context, title, message, and a callback for the confirmation action.
// 7. When the user confirms the dialog, the onConfirm callback is executed, which pops the dialog off the navigation stack, returning to the previous screen.
