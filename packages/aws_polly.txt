# Overview of the aws_polly Flutter Package

The `aws_polly` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to integrate Amazon Polly's text-to-speech capabilities into their Flutter applications. Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech, enabling developers to create applications that can speak to users in a natural-sounding voice. This package is particularly useful for applications that require voice output, such as educational apps, accessibility tools, and interactive voice response systems.

## When to Use aws_polly
- **Accessibility**: Enhance the accessibility of your app by providing voice output for visually impaired users.
- **E-Learning**: Create engaging educational applications that read text aloud to users.
- **Interactive Applications**: Build chatbots or interactive applications that can respond to user input with spoken words.

## Key Features
- **Multiple Voices**: Supports a variety of voices and languages, allowing for a personalized user experience.
- **Speech Markers**: Provides detailed speech markers for better control over speech output.
- **Customizable Speech Rate and Volume**: Adjust the speech rate and volume to suit user preferences.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for integrating text-to-speech functionality into Flutter apps.

# Setting Up and Using the aws_polly Package

## Installation
To use the `aws_polly` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  aws_polly: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/aws_polly).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions for network access.

## Basic Usage
To use the `aws_polly` package, you need to initialize it with your AWS credentials. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the package:

```dart
import 'package:aws_polly/aws_polly.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final Polly polly;

  RealFlutter() : polly = Polly(
    region: 'us-east-1', // Your AWS region
    accessKey: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    secretKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
  );

  void speak(String text) async {
    final response = await polly.synthesizeSpeech(
      text: text,
      voiceId: 'Joanna', // Choose a voice
      outputFormat: 'mp3',
    );

    // Play the audio response
    // (You would need an audio player package to play the audio)
  }
}
```

This example initializes the `Polly` class with your AWS credentials and provides a method to convert text to speech.

# Complete Example of Using aws_polly in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:aws_polly/aws_polly.dart';
import 'package:audioplayers/audioplayers.dart'; // Import an audio player package

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AWS Polly Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final Polly polly = Polly(
    region: 'us-east-1', // Your AWS region
    accessKey: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    secretKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
  );
  final AudioPlayer audioPlayer = AudioPlayer(); // Initialize audio player
  String textToSpeak = "Hello, welcome to the AWS Polly Flutter example!";

  // Function to convert text to speech
  void speak() async {
    final response = await polly.synthesizeSpeech(
      text: textToSpeak,
      voiceId: 'Joanna', // Choose a voice
      outputFormat: 'mp3',
    );

    // Play the audio response
    if (response.audioStream != null) {
      // Save the audio stream to a temporary file and play it
      final tempFile = await _saveAudioToFile(response.audioStream);
      await audioPlayer.play(tempFile.path, isLocal: true);
    }
  }

  // Function to save audio stream to a file
  Future<File> _saveAudioToFile(Uint8List audioStream) async {
    final directory = await getTemporaryDirectory();
    final file = File('${directory.path}/speech.mp3');
    await file.writeAsBytes(audioStream);
    return file;
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('AWS Polly Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: speak, // Call the speak function on button press
          child: Text('Speak'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// 2. `MyApp` sets up the MaterialApp and points to the `RealFlutter` widget as the home screen.
// 3. In the `RealFlutter` widget, we initialize the AWS Polly instance with the required credentials.
// 4. We define a `speak` function that calls the `synthesizeSpeech` method of the Polly instance to convert text to speech.
// 5. The audio stream returned from the Polly service is saved to a temporary file using the `_saveAudioToFile` method.
// 6. The audio file is then played using the `AudioPlayer` package when the user presses the "Speak" button.
// 7. The UI consists of a simple button that triggers the speech synthesis when pressed.
