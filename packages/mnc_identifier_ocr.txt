# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using mnc_identifier_ocr

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `mnc_identifier_ocr` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `mnc_identifier_ocr` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mnc_identifier_ocr: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for OCR functionality.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the photo library for OCR functionality.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement OCR functionality.

# Complete Example of mnc_identifier_ocr

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mnc_identifier_ocr/mnc_identifier_ocr.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'OCR Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: OCRHomePage(), // Set the home page
    );
  }
}

class OCRHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _OCRHomePageState createState() => _OCRHomePageState();
}

class _OCRHomePageState extends State<OCRHomePage> {
  String _recognizedText = ''; // Variable to hold recognized text

  // Function to initiate OCR process
  Future<void> _performOCR() async {
    try {
      // Call the OCR method from the package
      String result = await MncIdentifierOcr.performOCR();
      setState(() {
        _recognizedText = result; // Update the recognized text
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors
      setState(() {
        _recognizedText = 'Error: $e'; // Display error message
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('OCR Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _performOCR, // Trigger OCR on button press
              child: Text('Start OCR'), // Button text
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              'Recognized Text: $_recognizedText', // Display recognized text
              textAlign: TextAlign.center,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home page as OCRHomePage.
// 3. OCRHomePage is a stateful widget that manages the recognized text state.
// 4. When the "Start OCR" button is pressed, the _performOCR function is called.
// 5. _performOCR uses the MncIdentifierOcr.performOCR() method to perform OCR.
// 6. The recognized text is then displayed on the screen.
// 7. If an error occurs during the OCR process, it is caught and displayed.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we have created a simple Flutter application that utilizes the `mnc_identifier_ocr` package to perform OCR. The application consists of a button that, when pressed, triggers the OCR process and displays the recognized text on the screen. 

### Summary of Application Flow
- The application initializes and displays a button.
- Upon pressing the button, the OCR process begins.
- The recognized text is updated in the UI, allowing users to see the results immediately.
- Error handling is included to manage any issues that arise during the OCR process.

This structured approach provides a comprehensive understanding of how to implement and utilize the `mnc_identifier_ocr` package in a Flutter application.
