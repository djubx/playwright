# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "page_flip" Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `page_flip` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  page_flip: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the page flip effect.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:page_flip/page_flip.dart';
```

2. Create a widget that utilizes the `PageFlip` class to display your content.

### Example Widget

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Page Flip Example')),
      body: PageFlip(
        front: Container(
          color: Colors.blue,
          child: Center(child: Text('Front Page', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24))),
        ),
        back: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          child: Center(child: Text('Back Page', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24))),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This widget creates a simple page flip effect between a blue front page and a green back page.

# Complete Example of Using the "page_flip" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:page_flip/page_flip.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Page Flip Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // This variable keeps track of the current page state
  bool isFront = true;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Page Flip Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: GestureDetector(
          onTap: () {
            // Toggle the page state on tap
            setState(() {
              isFront = !isFront;
            });
          },
          child: PageFlip(
            front: Container(
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(child: Text('Front Page', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24))),
            ),
            back: Container(
              color: Colors.green,
              child: Center(child: Text('Back Page', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24))),
            ),
            // The flip direction can be customized
            flipDirection: isFront ? FlipDirection.left : FlipDirection.right,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the MaterialApp widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which contains the page flip functionality.
// 3. A GestureDetector is used to detect taps on the page, toggling between the front and back pages.
// 4. The PageFlip widget is used to display the front and back pages, with a customizable flip direction.
// 5. When the user taps the screen, the state is updated, causing the page to flip to the other side.
