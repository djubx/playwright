# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using dyn_mouse_scroll

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `dyn_mouse_scroll` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `dyn_mouse_scroll` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dyn_mouse_scroll: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable mouse support in your `Info.plist`. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>io.flutter.embedded_views_preview</key>
<true/>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement mouse scrolling using the `dyn_mouse_scroll` package.

# Complete Example of dyn_mouse_scroll

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dyn_mouse_scroll/dyn_mouse_scroll.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dyn Mouse Scroll Example',
      home: MouseScrollExample(),
    );
  }
}

class MouseScrollExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MouseScrollExampleState createState() => _MouseScrollExampleState();
}

class _MouseScrollExampleState extends State<MouseScrollExample> {
  // Controller for the scrollable widget
  final ScrollController _scrollController = ScrollController();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the dyn_mouse_scroll package
    DynMouseScroll.init(_scrollController);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the scroll controller when done
    _scrollController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dyn Mouse Scroll Example'),
      ),
      body: Container(
        // Set a fixed height for the scrollable area
        height: 400,
        child: SingleChildScrollView(
          controller: _scrollController,
          child: Column(
            children: List.generate(100, (index) {
              return Container(
                height: 50,
                color: index % 2 == 0 ? Colors.blue[100] : Colors.blue[200],
                child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
              );
            }),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (MouseScrollExample).
// 3. MouseScrollExample is a stateful widget that manages a scroll controller.
// 4. In initState, we initialize the dyn_mouse_scroll package with the scroll controller.
// 5. The build method creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a SingleChildScrollView.
// 6. The SingleChildScrollView uses the scroll controller to manage scrolling.
// 7. A list of 100 items is generated, each with alternating colors for visibility.
// 8. The application allows users to scroll through the items using mouse input, thanks to the dyn_mouse_scroll package.
