# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Pedometer Plus

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `pedometer_plus` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `pedometer_plus` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pedometer_plus: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION"/>
```

2. If targeting Android 10 (API level 29) or higher, you must request permission at runtime.

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key to request permission for motion tracking:

```xml
<key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to motion data to track steps.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. The following sections will guide you through the implementation.

# Complete Example of Pedometer Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pedometer_plus/pedometer_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the step count
  int _stepCount = 0;

  // Stream to listen for step updates
  late Stream<StepCount> _stepCountStream;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the step count stream
    _stepCountStream = PedometerPlus.stepCountStream;
    // Listen for step count updates
    _stepCountStream.listen((StepCount stepCount) {
      setState(() {
        _stepCount = stepCount.steps; // Update the step count
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Pedometer Plus Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Steps taken:',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              Text(
                '$_stepCount', // Display the step count
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we define a stateful widget to manage the step count.
// 3. The _stepCount variable holds the current number of steps.
// 4. The _stepCountStream is initialized to listen for step count updates from the PedometerPlus package.
// 5. When the app is initialized, we start listening to the step count stream.
// 6. Each time a new step count is received, we update the _stepCount variable and rebuild the UI.
// 7. The UI displays the total number of steps taken in a simple layout.
```

## Summary
In this blog, we explored the `pedometer_plus` Flutter package, detailing its features and use cases. We walked through the setup process, including platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS. Finally, we provided a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates how to implement step tracking using this package. The application listens for step count updates and displays the total steps taken in real-time, showcasing the package's capabilities effectively.
