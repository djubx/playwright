// This is the main entry point of the app.
// The app uses the Material theme and has a single page with a button and a text widget.
// When the button is pressed, a new ID is generated and displayed in the text widget.
// The ID is generated using the min_id package, which provides a fast and efficient way to generate unique IDs.
// The app demonstrates how to use the min_id package to generate IDs and display them in a Flutter app.

// To run the app, save this code in a file called main.dart and run it using the Flutter command-line tool.
// Make sure to add the min_id package to your project's pubspec.yaml file and run flutter pub get to install the package.

// This code provides a complete example of how to use the min_id package in a Flutter app.
// It demonstrates how to generate IDs and display them in a text widget, and provides a basic example of how to use the package in a real-world app.
