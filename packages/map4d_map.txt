// The app starts by creating a `MapView` widget and setting the initial camera position.
// When the map is created, a marker and a polygon are added to the map.
// The user can then interact with the map by zooming in and out, panning, and tilting.
// The camera can also be controlled programmatically using the `CameraUpdate` class.
// In this example, a floating action button is used to zoom in on the map.

// The `MapView` widget is used to display the map and handle user interactions.
// The `MapController` class is used to control the camera and add markers and polygons to the map.
// The `Marker` and `Polygon` classes are used to create markers and polygons, respectively.
// The `CameraUpdate` class is used to control the camera and animate camera movements.

// This is a basic example of how to use the `map4d_map` package to display a map and add markers and polygons.
// There are many other features and options available, such as customizing the map style, adding custom markers and polygons, and using the device's location services.
