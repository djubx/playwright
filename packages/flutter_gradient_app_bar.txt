# Setting Up the Package
-------------------------

To use the `flutter_gradient_app_bar` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec File

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_gradient_app_bar: ^1.0.0
```
### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_gradient_app_bar/flutter_gradient_app_bar.dart';
```
### Step 3: Use the GradientAppBar Widget

Use the `GradientAppBar` widget instead of the built-in `AppBar` widget:
```dart
GradientAppBar(
  title: Text('Gradient App Bar'),
  gradient: LinearGradient(
    colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
  ),
)
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* Android: No additional configuration required.
* iOS: No additional configuration required.

### Optimizations

* To improve performance, use a `LinearGradient` with a small number of colors.
* To reduce memory usage, use a `RadialGradient` instead of a `LinearGradient`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gradient_app_bar/flutter_gradient_app_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gradient App Bar Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: GradientAppBar(
          // Step 1: Create a GradientAppBar widget
          title: Text('Gradient App Bar'),
          // Step 2: Define the gradient colors
          gradient: LinearGradient(
            colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
          ),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, World!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created and returned by the main function.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created with a title and a home property.
// 3. The Scaffold widget is created with an appBar and a body property.
// 4. The GradientAppBar widget is created with a title and a gradient property.
// 5. The LinearGradient widget is created with a list of colors.
// 6. The app bar is displayed with a gradient color effect.
// 7. The body of the Scaffold widget is displayed with a centered text.

// Summary: The code creates a Flutter app with a gradient-colored app bar using the GradientAppBar widget. The app bar's gradient colors are defined using a LinearGradient widget. The app's UI is displayed using a Scaffold widget with a centered text.
