# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Dotted Dashed Line Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `dotted_dashed_line` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dotted_dashed_line: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the dotted or dashed line, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:dotted_dashed_line/dotted_dashed_line.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

You can now use the `DottedDashedLine` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
DottedDashedLine(
  direction: Axis.horizontal, // Choose the direction of the line
  lineLength: 200.0,           // Set the length of the line
  lineThickness: 2.0,          // Set the thickness of the line
  dashLength: 5.0,             // Set the length of each dash
  dashGap: 3.0,                // Set the gap between dashes
  color: Colors.black,         // Set the color of the line
),
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
  
- **iOS**: No additional configuration is required for iOS, but ensure that your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

## Step 4: Optimizations

For better performance, especially if you are using multiple lines in a single screen, consider using the `const` constructor where applicable to reduce widget rebuilds.

# Complete Example of Using the Dotted Dashed Line Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dotted_dashed_line/dotted_dashed_line.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dotted Dashed Line Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dotted Dashed Line Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('Section 1'),
              // Adding a dotted line between sections
              DottedDashedLine(
                direction: Axis.horizontal,
                lineLength: 200.0,
                lineThickness: 2.0,
                dashLength: 5.0,
                dashGap: 3.0,
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
              Text('Section 2'),
              // Adding a dashed line between sections
              DottedDashedLine(
                direction: Axis.horizontal,
                lineLength: 200.0,
                lineThickness: 2.0,
                dashLength: 10.0,
                dashGap: 5.0,
                color: Colors.red,
              ),
              Text('Section 3'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Dotted Dashed Line Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, we have three Text widgets representing different sections.
// 6. Between the Text widgets, we add two DottedDashedLine widgets:
//    - The first line is a dotted line in blue color between Section 1 and Section 2.
//    - The second line is a dashed line in red color between Section 2 and Section 3.
// 7. The layout is responsive and will adjust based on the screen size.
```
