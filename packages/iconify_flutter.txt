# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Iconify Flutter

## Step 1: Adding Dependency

To get started with the **iconify_flutter** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  iconify_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/iconify_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:iconify_flutter/iconify_flutter.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Iconify Icons

You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use an icon:

```dart
Iconify(
  'mdi:home', // Specify the icon name from the Material Design Icons set
  size: 48, // Set the size of the icon
  color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the icon
)
```

## Step 5: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons further by adjusting their properties. For example:

```dart
Iconify(
  'mdi:account',
  size: 64,
  color: Colors.red,
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle icon tap
  },
)
```

This allows you to create interactive icons that respond to user input.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate and use the **iconify_flutter** package in your Flutter applications effectively.

# Complete Example of Using Iconify Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iconify_flutter/iconify_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Iconify Flutter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Iconify Flutter Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a home icon
              Iconify(
                'mdi:home',
                size: 48,
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying an account icon
              Iconify(
                'mdi:account',
                size: 64,
                color: Colors.red,
                onPressed: () {
                  // Handle account icon tap
                  print('Account icon tapped!');
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a settings icon
              Iconify(
                'mdi:settings',
                size: 48,
                color: Colors.green,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Iconify Flutter Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, three Iconify widgets are displayed:
//    - The first icon is a home icon, sized 48 and colored blue.
//    - The second icon is an account icon, sized 64 and colored red, with an onPressed callback that prints a message when tapped.
//    - The third icon is a settings icon, sized 48 and colored green.
// 6. Each icon is separated by a SizedBox for better spacing.
