# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Currency Picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `currency_picker` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `currency_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  currency_picker: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 4: Using the Currency Picker

Now that the package is set up, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the currency picker.

# Complete Example of Currency Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:currency_picker/currency_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Currency Picker Example',
      home: CurrencyPickerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class CurrencyPickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CurrencyPickerDemoState createState() => _CurrencyPickerDemoState();
}

class _CurrencyPickerDemoState extends State<CurrencyPickerDemo> {
  // Variable to hold the selected currency
  String selectedCurrency = 'USD';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Currency Picker Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the currently selected currency
            Text(
              'Selected Currency: $selectedCurrency',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open the currency picker
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Open the currency picker dialog
                showCurrencyPicker(
                  context: context,
                  showFlag: true, // Show currency flags
                  onSelect: (Currency currency) {
                    // Update the selected currency when a currency is picked
                    setState(() {
                      selectedCurrency = currency.code; // Update the state
                    });
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Select Currency'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the currency_picker package.
// 
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. The CurrencyPickerDemo widget is a stateful widget that maintains the selected currency state.
// 4. In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget containing:
//    - A Text widget displaying the currently selected currency.
//    - An ElevatedButton that, when pressed, opens the currency picker dialog.
// 5. The showCurrencyPicker function is called to display the picker, and the onSelect callback updates the selected currency state when a currency is chosen.
// 6. The UI updates to reflect the newly selected currency.
```
