# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_chat_bubble

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_chat_bubble` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_chat_bubble` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_chat_bubble: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement chat bubbles in your app.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_chat_bubble/chat_bubble.dart';
```

2. Create a simple chat interface using the `ChatBubble` widget.

You can customize the chat bubbles by changing their properties, such as `alignment`, `margin`, and `color`.

That's it! You are now ready to use the `flutter_chat_bubble` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of flutter_chat_bubble

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_chat_bubble/chat_bubble.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Chat Bubble Example',
      home: ChatScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ChatScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chat Bubble Example'),
      ),
      body: ListView(
        children: [
          // Displaying a chat bubble for a message from the user
          ChatBubble(
            alignment: Alignment.topRight, // Aligns the bubble to the right
            margin: EdgeInsets.only(top: 10, left: 50), // Margin for the bubble
            backGroundColor: Colors.blue, // Background color of the bubble
            child: Text(
              'Hello! How are you?',
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white), // Text color
            ),
          ),
          // Displaying a chat bubble for a message from the other user
          ChatBubble(
            alignment: Alignment.topLeft, // Aligns the bubble to the left
            margin: EdgeInsets.only(top: 10, right: 50), // Margin for the bubble
            backGroundColor: Colors.grey[300], // Background color of the bubble
            child: Text(
              'I am fine, thank you!',
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black), // Text color
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The ChatScreen widget is displayed as the home screen, which contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a ListView.
// 4. Inside the ListView, two ChatBubble widgets are created to represent messages from two users.
// 5. The first ChatBubble is aligned to the right, representing a message from the user, with a blue background.
// 6. The second ChatBubble is aligned to the left, representing a message from the other user, with a grey background.
// 7. The text inside each bubble is styled with appropriate colors for visibility.
