# Flutter GIF Package: RealFlutter

The `gif` Flutter package, referred to here as `RealFlutter`, is a powerful tool for developers looking to integrate GIF images into their Flutter applications. This package simplifies the process of displaying and controlling GIF animations, making it an essential asset for applications that require dynamic and engaging visual content.

## When to Use RealFlutter

RealFlutter is ideal for applications that need to display animated content, such as:
- **Loading Indicators**: Use GIFs to create visually appealing loading animations.
- **User Feedback**: Enhance user interactions with animated feedback.
- **Entertainment Apps**: Display GIFs as part of the content in media or social apps.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Quickly add GIFs to your Flutter app with minimal setup.
- **Control Playback**: Start, stop, and pause GIF animations programmatically.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Efficiently handle GIF rendering to maintain smooth app performance.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

# Setting Up RealFlutter in Your Flutter Project

Integrating RealFlutter into your Flutter project is straightforward. Follow these steps to get started:

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, add the `gif` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  gif: ^3.0.1
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

No additional setup is required for Android. The package works out of the box.

### iOS

Ensure your `ios/Podfile` has platform version set to at least 9.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to update the CocoaPods dependencies.

## Step 3: Using RealFlutter

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:gif/gif.dart';
```

You can now use the `Gif` widget to display GIFs in your application.

      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,

              controller: controller,
              // Display the GIF using the controller
              onFetchCompleted: () {
                // Start the animation once the GIF is loaded
                controller.repeat(min: 0, max: 29, period: Duration(seconds: 2));
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Toggle play/pause on button press
                if (controller.isAnimating) {
                  controller.stop();
                } else {
                  controller.repeat(min: 0, max: 29, period: Duration(seconds: 2));
                }
              },
              child: Text(controller.isAnimating ? 'Pause' : 'Play'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts with the `main` function, which calls `runApp` to launch the `MyApp` widget.
// `MyApp` is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a home page of `GifDemoPage`.
// `GifDemoPage` is a stateful widget that manages the state of the GIF animation using `GifController`.
// In `initState`, the `GifController` is initialized with a duration for the animation.
// The `build` method constructs the UI, displaying the GIF and a button to control playback.
// The `Gif` widget uses an `AssetImage` to load the GIF from the assets folder.
// The `onFetchCompleted` callback starts the animation once the GIF is fully loaded.
// The button toggles the animation state between play and pause using the controller.
