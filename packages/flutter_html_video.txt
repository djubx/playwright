void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override

}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a video player
  HtmlVideoPlayer _videoPlayer;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the video player
    _videoPlayer = HtmlVideoPlayer(
      url: 'https://example.com/video.mp4',
      width: 300,
      height: 200,
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Real Flutter',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Real Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: _videoPlayer,
        ),
      ),
