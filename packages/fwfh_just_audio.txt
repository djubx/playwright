# Complete Example of fwfh_just_audio

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fwfh_just_audio/fwfh_just_audio.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of the audio player
  final AudioPlayer _player = AudioPlayer();
  bool _isPlaying = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load an audio file from assets when the app starts
    _loadAudio();
  }

  Future<void> _loadAudio() async {
    // Load the audio file
    await _player.setAsset('assets/audio/sample.mp3');
  }

  void _togglePlayPause() {
    // Toggle play/pause based on the current state
    if (_isPlaying) {
      _player.pause();
    } else {
      _player.play();
    }
    setState(() {
      _isPlaying = !_isPlaying; // Update the playing state
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the player when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _player.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Audio Player Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _togglePlayPause, // Play or pause the audio
            child: Text(_isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'), // Button text changes based on state
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, an instance of AudioPlayer is created.
// 3. The audio file is loaded in the initState method, ensuring it's ready to play when the user interacts.
// 4. The UI consists of a button that toggles between play and pause states.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the _togglePlayPause method is called, which plays or pauses the audio based on the current state.
// 6. The app also disposes of the audio player when the widget is removed to free up resources.
