# Flutter BLE Peripheral Package: An Overview

The `flutter_ble_peripheral` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) peripheral functionalities in their applications. This package allows your Flutter app to act as a BLE peripheral, broadcasting data to nearby BLE central devices. 

## When to Use

This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need your app to communicate with other BLE-enabled devices without requiring an internet connection. For example:
- **IoT Applications**: Communicate with smart home devices or wearables.
- **Proximity Marketing**: Broadcast promotional content to nearby users.
- **Data Sharing**: Share small amounts of data between devices in close proximity.

## Features

- **Broadcasting**: Advertise your device's presence and services to nearby BLE central devices.
- **Custom Data**: Send custom data packets to connected devices.
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports both Android and iOS platforms.

# Setting Up and Using the Flutter BLE Peripheral Package

In this section, we'll walk through the setup process for the `flutter_ble_peripheral` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Setup Process

### 1. Add Dependency

Add the `flutter_ble_peripheral` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_ble_peripheral: ^1.0.0
```

### 2. Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

- Ensure your `AndroidManifest.xml` includes the necessary permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
```

- Add the following to your `android/app/build.gradle` to ensure compatibility:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 33
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        targetSdkVersion 33
    }
}
```

#### iOS

- Update your `Info.plist` with the required permissions:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need to use Bluetooth to communicate with nearby devices.</string>
```

- Ensure your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using the Package

To use the `flutter_ble_peripheral` package, you need to initialize the `RealFlutter` class and start advertising.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_ble_peripheral/flutter_ble_peripheral.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final FlutterBlePeripheral blePeripheral = FlutterBlePeripheral();

  void startAdvertising() {
    blePeripheral.start(
      name: "RealFlutterDevice",
      uuid: "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc",
      manufacturerId: 1234,
      manufacturerData: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    );
  }

  void stopAdvertising() {
    blePeripheral.stop();
  }
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_ble_peripheral/flutter_ble_peripheral.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  final RealFlutter realFlutter = RealFlutter();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('BLE Peripheral Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              isAdvertising ? 'Advertising...' : 'Not Advertising',
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                setState(() {
                  if (isAdvertising) {
                    realFlutter.stopAdvertising();
                  } else {
                    realFlutter.startAdvertising();
                  }
                  isAdvertising = !isAdvertising;
                });
              },
              child: Text(isAdvertising ? 'Stop Advertising' : 'Start Advertising'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter {
  final FlutterBlePeripheral blePeripheral = FlutterBlePeripheral();

  void startAdvertising() {
    // Start advertising with a specific name, UUID, and manufacturer data
    blePeripheral.start(
      name: "RealFlutterDevice",
      uuid: "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc",
      manufacturerId: 1234,
      manufacturerData: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    );
  }

  void stopAdvertising() {
    // Stop advertising
    blePeripheral.stop();
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app initializes and displays a simple UI with a button.
// 2. When the button is pressed, it toggles the advertising state.
// 3. If advertising is started, the device broadcasts its presence with specified data.
// 4. Pressing the button again stops the advertising.
// 5. The UI updates to reflect the current advertising state.
