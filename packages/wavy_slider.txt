# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Wavy Slider

## Installation
To use the **wavy_slider** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wavy_slider: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using Wavy Slider
To use the **wavy_slider** in your Flutter application, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:wavy_slider/wavy_slider.dart';
   ```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the slider's state.

3. Use the `WavySlider` widget in your build method, customizing it as needed.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the Wavy Slider in your app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wavy_slider/wavy_slider.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _sliderValue = 0.5; // Initial value for the slider

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Wavy Slider Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Value: ${_sliderValue.toStringAsFixed(2)}'),
            WavySlider(
              value: _sliderValue,
              onChanged: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  _sliderValue = value; // Update the slider value
                });
              },
              waveAmplitude: 10, // Customize wave amplitude
              waveFrequency: 2, // Customize wave frequency
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a Wavy Slider that updates its value as the user interacts with it.

# Complete Example of Wavy Slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wavy_slider/wavy_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _sliderValue = 0.5; // Initial value for the slider

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Wavy Slider Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the current value of the slider
            Text('Value: ${_sliderValue.toStringAsFixed(2)}'),
            // WavySlider widget
            WavySlider(
              value: _sliderValue, // Current value of the slider
              onChanged: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  _sliderValue = value; // Update the slider value on change
                });
              },
              waveAmplitude: 10, // Set the amplitude of the wave
              waveFrequency: 2, // Set the frequency of the wave
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget, which is the root of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the slider value.
// 3. The _sliderValue variable holds the current value of the slider, initialized to 0.5.
// 4. In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the Text and WavySlider vertically.
// 6. The Text widget displays the current value of the slider, formatted to two decimal places.
// 7. The WavySlider widget is created with the current value and an onChanged callback.
// 8. When the slider is moved, the onChanged callback updates the _sliderValue state, causing the UI to rebuild and display the new value.
