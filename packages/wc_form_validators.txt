# wc_form_validators Flutter Package

The `wc_form_validators` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers, designed to simplify the process of validating form inputs. It provides a set of pre-defined validators that can be easily integrated into your Flutter applications, ensuring that user inputs meet specific criteria before submission. This package is particularly useful in applications that require user registration, login forms, or any scenario where data integrity is crucial.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `wc_form_validators` package when:
- You need to validate user inputs in forms, such as email addresses, passwords, or phone numbers.
- You want to enforce specific rules for input fields, like minimum length or format.
- You prefer a clean and maintainable codebase by utilizing reusable validation functions.

## Features

- **Pre-defined Validators**: The package comes with a variety of built-in validators for common use cases, such as email validation, password strength checks, and required field checks.
- **Custom Validators**: You can easily create your own validation functions to meet specific requirements.
- **Integration with Flutter Forms**: The package seamlessly integrates with Flutter's form widgets, making it easy to implement validation logic.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using wc_form_validators

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `wc_form_validators` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wc_form_validators: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the validators, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:wc_form_validators/wc_form_validators.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Validators in a Form

Hereâ€™s how to implement the validators in a simple form. Below is a basic example of a registration form that uses the `RealFlutter` class.

### Android and iOS Specific Configurations

For both Android and iOS, no additional configurations are required for the `wc_form_validators` package itself. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms. You can check your setup by running:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

Make sure to resolve any issues that may arise.

## Step 4: Implementing the Form

You can now create a form using the validators. Below is a complete example that demonstrates how to use the `wc_form_validators` package effectively.

# Complete Example of Using wc_form_validators

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wc_form_validators/wc_form_validators.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Form Validation Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Form Validation with wc_form_validators'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: RegistrationForm(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RegistrationForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RegistrationFormState createState() => _RegistrationFormState();
}

class _RegistrationFormState extends State<RegistrationForm> {
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>(); // Key to identify the form
  String? _email; // Variable to hold email input
  String? _password; // Variable to hold password input

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Form(
      key: _formKey, // Assigning the form key
      child: Column(
        children: [
          TextFormField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
            validator: Validators.compose([
              Validators.required('Email is required'), // Required validator
              Validators.email('Enter a valid email'), // Email format validator
            ]),
            onSaved: (value) {
              _email = value; // Saving email input
            },
          ),
          TextFormField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Password'),
            obscureText: true, // Hiding password input
            validator: Validators.compose([
              Validators.required('Password is required'), // Required validator
              Validators.minLength(6, 'Password must be at least 6 characters'), // Minimum length validator
            ]),
            onSaved: (value) {
              _password = value; // Saving password input
            },
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _submitForm, // Submit button action
            child: Text('Register'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  void _submitForm() {
    if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) { // Validating the form
      _formKey.currentState!.save(); // Saving the form inputs
      // Here you can handle the registration logic, e.g., API call
      print('Email: $_email, Password: $_password'); // Debugging output
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The RegistrationForm widget is displayed in the body of the Scaffold.
// 4. The RegistrationForm contains a form with two fields: email and password.
// 5. Each field has its own validator to ensure the input meets the required criteria.
// 6. When the user presses the "Register" button, the _submitForm method is called.
// 7. The form is validated, and if successful, the input values are saved and can be used for further processing.
