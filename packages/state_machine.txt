In summary, the `state_machine` package provides a simple and efficient way to manage complex app states. By defining a set of states and transitions between them, you can create a robust and scalable app that responds to user input and changes in the app's state. The example app demonstrates how to use the `state_machine` package to create a simple app with two states: `logged_in` and `logged_out`. The app transitions between these states in response to user input, and displays the current state of the machine on the screen.
