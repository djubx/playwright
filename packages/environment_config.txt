Here's a detailed technical blog on the "environment_config" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Environment Config Flutter Package

The `environment_config` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to manage different configurations for various environments in your Flutter applications. This package allows developers to define environment-specific variables, making it easier to switch between development, staging, and production settings without changing the codebase.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `environment_config` package when:
- You have multiple environments (development, staging, production) and need to manage different configurations for each.
- You want to avoid hardcoding sensitive information (like API keys) directly in your code.
- You need a clean and organized way to manage environment variables.

## Features

- **Environment Management**: Easily switch between different configurations based on the environment.
- **Type Safety**: Provides type-safe access to environment variables.
- **Custom Configuration**: Allows you to define custom configurations for your application.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and integration into existing Flutter projects.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Environment Config Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `environment_config` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  environment_config: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Create Configuration Files

Create a directory named `config` in the root of your Flutter project. Inside this directory, create separate configuration files for each environment. For example:

- `config/development.dart`
- `config/staging.dart`
- `config/production.dart`

Each file should export a class that contains the environment-specific variables. Hereâ€™s an example for `development.dart`:

```dart
// config/development.dart
class DevelopmentConfig {
  static const String apiUrl = "https://dev.api.example.com";
  static const String apiKey = "dev-api-key";
}
```

Repeat this for `staging.dart` and `production.dart`, changing the values accordingly.

## Step 3: Create the Main Configuration File

Create a file named `environment.dart` in the `config` directory to manage the environment selection:

```dart
// config/environment.dart
import 'development.dart' as dev;
import 'staging.dart' as stag;
import 'production.dart' as prod;

class EnvironmentConfig {
  static String get apiUrl {
    switch (const String.fromEnvironment('ENV')) {
      case 'production':
        return prod.ProductionConfig.apiUrl;
      case 'staging':
        return stag.StagingConfig.apiUrl;
      default:
        return dev.DevelopmentConfig.apiUrl;
    }
  }

  static String get apiKey {
    switch (const String.fromEnvironment('ENV')) {
      case 'production':
        return prod.ProductionConfig.apiKey;
      case 'staging':
        return stag.StagingConfig.apiKey;
      default:
        return dev.DevelopmentConfig.apiKey;
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Update the Main File

In your `main.dart`, import the `environment.dart` file and use the configuration values:

```dart
// main.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'config/environment.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Environment Config Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Environment Config Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('API URL: ${EnvironmentConfig.apiUrl}'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Run the Application

To run the application with a specific environment, use the following command:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=ENV=development
```

Replace `development` with `staging` or `production` as needed.

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `build.gradle` file is set up to support the `--dart-define` option.
- **iOS**: No additional configuration is needed, but ensure you have the correct scheme selected in Xcode.

# Complete Example of Using Environment Config

```dart
// main.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'config/environment.dart';

void main() {
  // Start the application
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Environment Config Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Environment Config Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Display the API URL based on the current environment
          child: Text('API URL: ${EnvironmentConfig.apiUrl}'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function initializes the MyApp widget.
// 3. MyApp builds a MaterialApp widget with a title and a home scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 5. The body of the scaffold contains a Center widget that displays the API URL.
// 6. The API URL is fetched from the EnvironmentConfig class, which determines the current environment based on the `ENV` variable.
// 7. When running the app, you can specify the environment using the --dart-define flag, allowing for dynamic configuration based on the environment.
```

In summary, the `environment_config` package provides a structured way to manage different configurations for your Flutter applications. By following the steps outlined in this blog, you can easily set up and utilize environment-specific variables, enhancing the maintainability and security of your code.
