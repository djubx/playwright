# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_expandable_widget

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_expandable_widget` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_expandable_widget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_expandable_widget/flutter_expandable_widget.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Expandable Widget

You can now use the `ExpandableWidget` in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it:

### Example Code

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_expandable_widget/flutter_expandable_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Expandable Widget Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Expandable Widget Example'),
        ),
        body: ExpandableExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ExpandableExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView(
      children: [
        ExpandableWidget(
          header: Text('Click to Expand'),
          expanded: Text('This is the expanded content!'),
        ),
        ExpandableWidget(
          header: Text('Another Expandable Item'),
          expanded: Text('More details about this item.'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 for compatibility.
- **iOS**: No additional configuration is required, but ensure your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

## Step 4: Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the expandable widget by modifying its properties, such as `header`, `expanded`, and adding animations.

# Complete Example of flutter_expandable_widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_expandable_widget/flutter_expandable_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Main application class
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Expandable Widget Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Expandable Widget Example'),
        ),
        body: ExpandableExample(),
      );
  }
}

// Widget demonstrating the expandable functionality
class ExpandableExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView(
      children: [
        // First expandable widget
        ExpandableWidget(
          header: Text('Click to Expand'),
          expanded: Text('This is the expanded content!'),
        ),
        // Second expandable widget
        ExpandableWidget(
          header: Text('Another Expandable Item'),
          expanded: Text('More details about this item.'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds the MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body that holds the ExpandableExample widget.
// 4. The ExpandableExample widget creates a ListView with two ExpandableWidget instances.
// 5. Each ExpandableWidget has a header and expanded content that is shown when the header is tapped.
// 6. The user can interact with the headers to expand or collapse the content, enhancing the UI experience.
