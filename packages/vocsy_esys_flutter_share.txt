# Complete Example

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `vocsy_esys_flutter_share` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:esys_flutter_share/esys_flutter_share.dart';
import 'dart:typed_data';
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Share Example',
      home: ShareExample(),
    );
  }
}

class ShareExample extends StatelessWidget {
  // Function to share text
  void shareText() async {
    // Sharing a simple text message
    await Share.text('Share Title', 'Hello from RealFlutter!', 'text/plain');
  }

  // Function to share an image
  void shareImage() async {
    // Load an image from assets (ensure you have an image in your assets)
    ByteData bytes = await rootBundle.load('assets/sample_image.png');
    Uint8List imageBytes = bytes.buffer.asUint8List();

    // Sharing the image
    await Share.file('Share Image', 'image.png', imageBytes, 'image/png');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Share Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: shareText,
              child: Text('Share Text'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: shareImage,
              child: Text('Share Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (ShareExample).
// 3. ShareExample contains two buttons: one for sharing text and another for sharing an image.
// 4. When the "Share Text" button is pressed, the shareText function is called, which uses the Share.text method to share a predefined message.
// 5. When the "Share Image" button is pressed, the shareImage function is called, which loads an image from the assets and shares it using the Share.file method.
// 6. The app provides a simple interface for users to share content easily.
```
