- **Personalization**: To tailor user experiences based on specific user segments.
- **Analytics**: To gather insights on user behavior and app performance.

## Key Features
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process to connect your Flutter app with VWO.
- **Real-time Data**: Access to real-time analytics and reporting.
- **User Segmentation**: Ability to create targeted campaigns based on user behavior.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using vwo_flutter

## Installation
To get started with the `vwo_flutter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  vwo_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Add the VWO SDK initialization in your `MainActivity.java` or `MainActivity.kt`:

```java
import com.vwo.mobile.VWO;

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    VWO.init(this, "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID");
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

3. Initialize the VWO SDK in your `AppDelegate.swift`:

```swift
import VWO

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        VWO.start(withAccountId: "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID")
        return true
    }
}
```

## Using the Package
Once you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement A/B testing.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vwo_flutter/vwo_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('VWO Flutter Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder(
            future: VWO.getVariation("YOUR_CAMPAIGN_KEY"),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                // Display the variation based on the campaign
                return Text('Variation: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the VWO SDK and retrieves the variation for a specific campaign key, displaying it in the app.

# Complete Example of vwo_flutter in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vwo_flutter/vwo_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('VWO Flutter Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder(
            // Fetching the variation for the specified campaign key
            future: VWO.getVariation("YOUR_CAMPAIGN_KEY"),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              // While waiting for the data, show a loading indicator
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } 
              // If there's an error, display it
              else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } 
              // Once data is received, display the variation
              else {
                return Text('Variation: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  // Run the Flutter application
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

```
// The application starts by running the main function, which initializes the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple UI.
// Inside the body of the Scaffold, a FutureBuilder is used to fetch the variation for a specific VWO campaign.
// While the data is being fetched, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed to indicate loading.
// If an error occurs during the fetch, it is displayed as text.
// Once the data is successfully retrieved, the variation is displayed in the center of the screen.
```

## Summary
The `vwo_flutter` package provides a straightforward way to integrate A/B testing and personalization into your Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, you can effectively utilize VWO's powerful features to enhance user experience and optimize your app's performance.
