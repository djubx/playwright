# Tutorial: Using the Animated Box Decoration Package
=====================================================

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of setting up and using the `animated_box_decoration` package in your Flutter application.

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec File

First, you'll need to add the `animated_box_decoration` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. You can do this by adding the following line:
```yml
dependencies:
  animated_box_decoration: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Next, you'll need to import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:animated_box_decoration/animated_box_decoration.dart';
```
### Step 3: Create an Animated Box

Now, you can create an animated box using the `AnimatedBoxDecoration` widget:
```dart
AnimatedBoxDecoration(
  child: Container(
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    color: Colors.red,
  ),
  animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  animationCurve: Curves.easeInOut,
)
```
This will create a red box that animates over a period of 500 milliseconds using the ease-in-out curve.

### Platform-Specific Details

The `animated_box_decoration` package is compatible with both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to make some adjustments to your code depending on the platform you're targeting.

For example, on Android, you may need to add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<application android:hardwareAccelerated="true">
```
This will enable hardware acceleration for your app, which is required for the animations to work properly.

import 'package:animated_box_decoration/animated_box_decoration.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Box Decoration Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animated Box Decoration Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedBoxDecoration(
          child: Container(
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            color: Colors.red,
          ),
          animationDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
          animationCurve: Curves.easeInOut,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by running the main function, which creates a new instance of the MyApp widget.
// The MyApp widget is a stateless widget that returns a MaterialApp widget.
// The MaterialApp widget is the top-level widget for the app, and it provides a basic material design visual layout structure.
// The home property of the MaterialApp widget is set to the MyHomePage widget, which is a stateful widget.
// The MyHomePage widget returns a Scaffold widget, which provides a basic material design visual layout structure.
// The body property of the Scaffold widget is set to a Center widget, which centers its child widget.
// The child widget of the Center widget is an AnimatedBoxDecoration widget, which is the main widget for this demo.
// The AnimatedBoxDecoration widget takes a child widget, which is a Container widget with a red background color.
// The animationDuration property of the AnimatedBoxDecoration widget is set to 500 milliseconds, and the animationCurve property is set to Curves.easeInOut.
// When the app is run, the AnimatedBoxDecoration widget will animate the Container widget over a period of 500 milliseconds using the ease-in-out curve.

// In summary, this code creates a basic material design app with a red box that animates over a period of 500 milliseconds using the ease-in-out curve.
