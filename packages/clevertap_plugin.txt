# Setting Up the CleverTap Plugin

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the CleverTap Plugin in a Flutter application, including platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `clevertap_plugin` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  clevertap_plugin: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and metadata:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="CleverTapAccountId"
            android:value="YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID" />
        <meta-data
            android:name="CleverTapAccountToken"
            android:value="YOUR_ACCOUNT_TOKEN" />
        <meta-data
            android:name="CleverTapRegion"
            android:value="YOUR_REGION" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Enable Multidex**: If your app exceeds the 64K method limit, enable multidex in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        multiDexEnabled true
    }
}
```

## Step 3: iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>CleverTapAccountId</key>
<string>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</string>
<key>CleverTapAccountToken</key>
<string>YOUR_ACCOUNT_TOKEN</string>
<key>CleverTapRegion</key>
<string>YOUR_REGION</string>
```

2. **CocoaPods Installation**: Ensure you have the latest CocoaPods installed. Run the following command in the `ios` directory:

```bash
pod install
```

## Step 4: Initialize CleverTap

In your main Dart file, initialize CleverTap in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:clevertap_plugin/clevertap_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  CleverTapPlugin.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Using CleverTap Features

You can now use CleverTap features such as tracking events, sending push notifications, and more. For example, to track an event:

```dart
CleverTapPlugin.recordEvent("EventName", {"Key": "Value"});
```

This setup will allow you to leverage the full capabilities of the CleverTap platform in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of CleverTap Plugin in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:clevertap_plugin/clevertap_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize CleverTap when the app starts
  CleverTapPlugin.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'CleverTap Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Record a user event when the app starts
    CleverTapPlugin.recordEvent("App Launched", {"Time": DateTime.now().toString()});
  }

  void _sendNotification() {
    // Send a push notification to the user
    CleverTapPlugin.sendPushNotification("Hello from CleverTap!", "This is a test notification.");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('CleverTap Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _sendNotification,
          child: Text('Send Notification'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and initializes CleverTap.
// 2. The HomePage widget is displayed.
// 3. In the initState method, an event "App Launched" is recorded with the current time.
// 4. The user sees a button labeled "Send Notification".
// 5. When the button is pressed, a push notification is sent using CleverTap's sendPushNotification method.
```
