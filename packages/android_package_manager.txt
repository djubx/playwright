# Android Package Manager Flutter Package

The `android_package_manager` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to interact with the Android package manager directly from their Flutter applications. This package provides a way to query, install, and manage applications on Android devices, making it particularly useful for applications that require package management functionalities, such as app installers, system utilities, or any app that needs to interact with other installed applications.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `android_package_manager` package in scenarios such as:
- **App Installers**: If you are building an app that needs to install other APKs.
- **System Utilities**: For applications that manage or monitor installed applications.
- **Custom Launchers**: If you are creating a custom launcher that needs to display installed apps.

## Features

- **Query Installed Packages**: Retrieve a list of all installed applications on the device.
- **Install Applications**: Programmatically install APK files.
- **Uninstall Applications**: Remove applications from the device.
- **Get Application Info**: Access detailed information about installed applications, such as version, permissions, and more.

This package is essential for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with advanced package management capabilities on Android devices.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Android Package Manager

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `android_package_manager` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  android_package_manager: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Permissions**: You need to add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.GET_PACKAGE_SIZE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES"/>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

Currently, the `android_package_manager` package is designed for Android only. Therefore, no specific iOS configuration is required.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to query installed packages and display them in a list.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:android_package_manager/android_package_manager.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Android Package Manager Demo',
      home: PackageManagerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PackageManagerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PackageManagerScreenState createState() => _PackageManagerScreenState();
}

class _PackageManagerScreenState extends State<PackageManagerScreen> {
  List<PackageInfo> _packages = []; // List to hold package information

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchInstalledPackages(); // Fetch installed packages on initialization
  }

  // Function to fetch installed packages
  Future<void> _fetchInstalledPackages() async {
    try {
      // Querying all installed packages
      final packages = await AndroidPackageManager.getInstalledPackages();
      setState(() {
        _packages = packages; // Updating the state with the fetched packages
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during package fetching
      print("Error fetching packages: $e");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Installed Packages'),
      ),
      body: _packages.isEmpty
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) // Show loading indicator while fetching
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: _packages.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                final package = _packages[index];
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(package.packageName), // Display package name
                  subtitle: Text('Version: ${package.versionName}'), // Display package version
                );
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (PackageManagerScreen).
// 3. PackageManagerScreen initializes an empty list to hold package information.
// 4. In the initState method, it calls _fetchInstalledPackages to retrieve the list of installed packages.
// 5. _fetchInstalledPackages uses the AndroidPackageManager to get the installed packages and updates the state.
// 6. The build method checks if the packages list is empty. If it is, a loading indicator is shown.
// 7. Once the packages are fetched, a ListView displays the package names and their versions.
