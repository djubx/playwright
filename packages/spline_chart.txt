# Spline Chart Flutter Package

The `spline_chart` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create visually appealing and interactive spline charts. Spline charts are a type of line chart that uses smooth curves to connect data points, making them ideal for displaying trends over time or continuous data.

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the `spline_chart` package in scenarios such as:
- Displaying stock market trends over time.
- Visualizing user engagement metrics in an application.
- Presenting any continuous data that benefits from a smooth representation.

## Features
- **Smooth Curves**: Automatically generates smooth curves between data points for a more visually appealing representation.
- **Customizable**: Offers various customization options for colors, line thickness, and point markers.
- **Interactive**: Supports touch interactions, allowing users to tap on data points for more information.
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

Overall, the `spline_chart` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their data visualization capabilities in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Spline Chart Package

## Installation
To get started with the `spline_chart` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  spline_chart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `spline_chart` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:spline_chart/spline_chart.dart';
```

You can then create a simple spline chart by providing a list of data points. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
SplineChart(
  data: [
    SplineChartData(x: 1, y: 2),
    SplineChartData(x: 2, y: 3),
    SplineChartData(x: 3, y: 5),
    SplineChartData(x: 4, y: 4),
  ],
  title: 'Sample Spline Chart',
);
```

This will render a spline chart with the specified data points.

# Complete Example of Spline Chart

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:spline_chart/spline_chart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Spline Chart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Spline Chart Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SplineChart(
            // Providing a list of data points for the spline chart
            data: [
              SplineChartData(x: 1, y: 2), // Point 1
              SplineChartData(x: 2, y: 3), // Point 2
              SplineChartData(x: 3, y: 5), // Point 3
              SplineChartData(x: 4, y: 4), // Point 4
              SplineChartData(x: 5, y: 6), // Point 5
            ],
            title: 'Sample Spline Chart', // Title of the chart
            xAxisLabel: 'X Axis', // Label for the X-axis
            yAxisLabel: 'Y Axis', // Label for the Y-axis
            lineColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the spline line
            pointColor: Colors.red, // Color of the data points
            pointRadius: 5.0, // Radius of the data points
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Spline Chart Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a SplineChart widget.
// 5. The SplineChart widget is configured with a list of SplineChartData points, a title, axis labels, and styling options.
// 6. The chart will render smoothly with the specified data points, showcasing the spline effect.
