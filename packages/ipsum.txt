### Tutorial

#### Installation

To add the "ipsum" package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ipsum: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

#### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: No additional configuration is required for Android. The package works out of the box.
- **iOS**: Similarly, there are no specific configurations needed for iOS. Just ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly.

#### Basic Usage

To use the "ipsum" package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:ipsum/ipsum.dart';
```

You can then generate placeholder text using the `Ipsum` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
String placeholderText = Ipsum.generateParagraphs(2); // Generates 2 paragraphs of placeholder text
```

You can customize the text generation by specifying the number of words, sentences, or paragraphs as needed.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ipsum/ipsum.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ipsum Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Ipsum Placeholder Text'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
            children: [
              // Generate a title using Ipsum
              Text(
                'Sample Title',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Generate 2 paragraphs of placeholder text
              Text(
                Ipsum.generateParagraphs(2),
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Ipsum Placeholder Text".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a Padding widget that adds space around its child widgets.
// 5. Inside the Padding, a Column widget is used to arrange the title and the placeholder text vertically.
// 6. The title is displayed using a Text widget with a larger font size and bold weight.
// 7. Below the title, a SizedBox adds space before displaying the generated placeholder text.
// 8. The Ipsum.generateParagraphs(2) method is called to generate two paragraphs of dummy text, which is then displayed in a Text widget.
