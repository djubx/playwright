// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a screen containing a button and a text area.
// 2. When the user clicks the button, the `_generateText` function is called, which generates a new paragraph of text using the `Ipsum` class.
// 3. The generated text is then displayed in the text area.
// 4. The user can click the button again to generate new text, which will replace the existing text in the text area.
