# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_live_activities

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_live_activities` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_live_activities` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_live_activities: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
```

2. Ensure that your deployment target is set to iOS 16.0 or later in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '16.0'
```

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` includes the necessary permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our application. Below is a simple example of how to implement live activities.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_live_activities/flutter_live_activities.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Live Activities Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Live Activities Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Start a live activity
              LiveActivities.startActivity(
                activityId: '12345',
                title: 'Live Score Update',
                content: 'Team A: 1 - Team B: 0',
              );
            },
            child: Text('Start Live Activity'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that starts a live activity when pressed. The `LiveActivities.startActivity` method is called with an activity ID, title, and content.

# Complete Example of flutter_live_activities

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_live_activities/flutter_live_activities.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Live Activities Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Live Activities Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Start a live activity with a unique ID
              LiveActivities.startActivity(
                activityId: '12345', // Unique identifier for the activity
                title: 'Live Score Update', // Title displayed in the live activity
                content: 'Team A: 1 - Team B: 0', // Initial content of the live activity
              );
            },
            child: Text('Start Live Activity'), // Button to trigger the live activity
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Live Activities Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is displayed in the center, which, when pressed, triggers the start of a live activity.
// 6. The LiveActivities.startActivity method is called with a unique activity ID, a title, and initial content.
// 7. This live activity will now be displayed on the lock screen or notification center, providing real-time updates to the user.
