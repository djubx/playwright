# Setting Up and Using Flutter Responsive Framework

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_responsive_framework`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_responsive_framework: ^0.1.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_responsive_framework`, you need to wrap your application in the `ResponsiveWrapper` widget. This widget will manage the responsive behavior of your app.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_responsive_framework/flutter_responsive_framework.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ResponsiveWrapper.builder(
      ClampingScrollWrapper.builder(context, MaterialApp(
        home: RealFlutter(),
      )),
      maxWidth: 1200,
      minWidth: 450,
      defaultScale: true,
      breakpoints: [
        ResponsiveBreakpoint.autoScale(450, name: MOBILE),
        ResponsiveBreakpoint.autoScale(800, name: TABLET),
        ResponsiveBreakpoint.autoScale(1200, name: DESKTOP),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ResponsiveWrapper` is set up with breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop views. The `RealFlutter` widget will automatically adjust its layout based on the screen size.

Now you are ready to create responsive layouts in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Flutter Responsive Framework

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_responsive_framework/flutter_responsive_framework.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ResponsiveWrapper.builder(
      ClampingScrollWrapper.builder(context, MaterialApp(
        title: 'Responsive Framework Demo',
        home: RealFlutter(),
      )),
      maxWidth: 1200,
      minWidth: 450,
      defaultScale: true,
      breakpoints: [
        ResponsiveBreakpoint.autoScale(450, name: MOBILE), // Mobile breakpoint
        ResponsiveBreakpoint.autoScale(800, name: TABLET), // Tablet breakpoint
        ResponsiveBreakpoint.autoScale(1200, name: DESKTOP), // Desktop breakpoint
      ],
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Responsive Framework Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display different text based on screen size
            Text(
              'You are on ${ResponsiveWrapper.of(context).isSmallerThan(TABLET) ? 'Mobile' : 'Desktop'}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Responsive Container
            Container(
              width: ResponsiveWrapper.of(context).isSmallerThan(TABLET) ? 200 : 400,
              height: 200,
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Responsive Box',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the ResponsiveWrapper with defined breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 4. Inside RealFlutter, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget contains a Column that displays text indicating the current device type (Mobile or Desktop).
// 6. A responsive Container is created that changes its width based on the device type, demonstrating the responsive behavior of the layout.
