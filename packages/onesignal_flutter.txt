# Tutorial: Setting Up OneSignal in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `onesignal_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `onesignal_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  onesignal_flutter: ^3.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Configure OneSignal

### Android Configuration

1. **Add Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED" />
   ```

2. **Initialize OneSignal**: In your `MainActivity.java` or `MainActivity.kt`, initialize OneSignal in the `onCreate` method:

   ```java
   import com.onesignal.OneSignal;

   public class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity {
       @Override
       public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
           super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
           OneSignal.setAppId("YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID");
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys:

   ```xml
   <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
   <array>
       <string>fetch</string>
       <string>remote-notification</string>
   </array>
   ```

2. **Request Permissions**: In your `AppDelegate.swift`, request notification permissions:

   ```swift
   import OneSignal

   @UIApplicationMain
   class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
       override func application(
           _ application: UIApplication,
           didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
       ) -> Bool {
           OneSignal.initWithLaunchOptions(launchOptions, appId: "YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID")
           return true
       }
   }
   ```

## Step 3: Using OneSignal in Your Flutter App

Now that we have configured OneSignal, we can use it in our Flutter application. You can initialize OneSignal and set up notification handlers in your main Dart file.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:onesignal_flutter/onesignal_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'OneSignal Flutter Demo',
      home: NotificationHome(),
    );
  }
}

class NotificationHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NotificationHomeState createState() => _NotificationHomeState();
}

class _NotificationHomeState extends State<NotificationHome> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize OneSignal
    OneSignal.shared.setAppId("YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID");

    // Prompt for push notifications
    OneSignal.shared.promptForPushNotificationsWithUserResponse().then((accepted) {
      print("Accepted permission: $accepted");
    });

    // Set notification opened handler
    OneSignal.shared.setNotificationOpenedHandler((OSNotificationOpenedResult result) {
      print('Notification opened: ${result.notification.jsonRepresentation()}');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('OneSignal Flutter Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to OneSignal Flutter Demo!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of OneSignal in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:onesignal_flutter/onesignal_flutter.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Main application widget
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'OneSignal Flutter Demo',
      home: NotificationHome(),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class NotificationHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _NotificationHomeState createState() => _NotificationHomeState();
}

// State for the NotificationHome widget
class _NotificationHomeState extends State<NotificationHome> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize OneSignal with your app ID
    OneSignal.shared.setAppId("YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID");

    // Request permission for push notifications
    OneSignal.shared.promptForPushNotificationsWithUserResponse().then((accepted) {
      // Log whether the user accepted the notification permission
      print("Accepted permission: $accepted");
    });

    // Set a handler for when a notification is opened
    OneSignal.shared.setNotificationOpenedHandler((OSNotificationOpenedResult result) {
      // Log the notification that was opened
      print('Notification opened: ${result.notification.jsonRepresentation()}');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('OneSignal Flutter Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to OneSignal Flutter Demo!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The NotificationHome widget is created, which initializes OneSignal in its initState() method.
// 4. It requests permission for push notifications and logs the user's response.
// 5. A notification opened handler is set to log any notifications that the user opens.
// 6. The app displays a simple welcome message in the center of the screen.
```
