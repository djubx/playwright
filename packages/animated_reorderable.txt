# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `animated_reorderable`

## Installation

To get started with the `animated_reorderable` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_reorderable: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/animated_reorderable).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

   ```dart
   import 'package:animated_reorderable/animated_reorderable.dart';
   ```

2. **Create a Stateful Widget**: Since the list will change dynamically, use a StatefulWidget to manage the state.

3. **Define Your List**: Create a list of items that you want to make reorderable.

4. **Implement the AnimatedReorderableList**: Use the `AnimatedReorderableList` widget to wrap your list items.

### Platform-Specific Considerations

- **Android**: Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions and configurations in the `AndroidManifest.xml` if you are using any additional features.
- **iOS**: Make sure to test the app on various iOS devices to ensure that the drag-and-drop functionality works smoothly.

With these steps, you can easily set up the `animated_reorderable` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using `animated_reorderable`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_reorderable/animated_reorderable.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Step 1: Define a list of items to be reordered
  List<String> items = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3', 'Item 4', 'Item 5'];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Reorderable List'),
        ),
        body: AnimatedReorderableList(
          // Step 2: Provide the list of items
          items: items,
          // Step 3: Define how each item should be built
          itemBuilder: (context, item, index) {
            return Card(
              child: ListTile(
                title: Text(item),
              ),
            );
          },
          // Step 4: Handle the reordering of items
          onReorder: (oldIndex, newIndex) {
            setState(() {
              // Step 5: Update the list based on the new order
              if (newIndex > oldIndex) newIndex--;
              final item = items.removeAt(oldIndex);
              items.insert(newIndex, item);
            });
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// Step 1: The app starts by defining a list of items that can be reordered.
// Step 2: The `AnimatedReorderableList` widget is used to create a reorderable list.
// Step 3: Each item in the list is represented by a `Card` containing a `ListTile` with the item's title.
// Step 4: The `onReorder` callback is triggered when an item is dragged and dropped.
// Step 5: Inside the `onReorder` method, the list is updated to reflect the new order of items, and the UI is rebuilt with the new state.

In summary, this example demonstrates how to create a simple reorderable list using the `animated_reorderable` package. The app allows users to drag and drop items, providing a smooth and interactive experience.
