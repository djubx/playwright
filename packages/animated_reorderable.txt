// The code flow is as follows:
// 1. The `ReorderableListView` is created with a list of items.
// 2. The `onReorder` event is triggered when the user reorders an item.
// 3. In the `onReorder` event, the item is removed from its old position and inserted into its new position.
// 4. The list is updated and the animation is triggered.
// 5. The animation moves the item from its old position to its new position.
