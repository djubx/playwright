  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tap_to_expand: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

## Step 3: Using the TapToExpand Widget

You can now use the `TapToExpand` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
TapToExpand(
  title: Text("Tap to Expand"),
  content: Text("This is the expanded content that is shown when tapped."),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the `TapToExpand` widget by using various properties such as `backgroundColor`, `borderRadius`, and `duration` for animations.

```dart
TapToExpand(
  title: Text("Custom Title"),
  content: Text("Custom content goes here."),
  backgroundColor: Colors.blueAccent,
  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),

# Complete Example of Tap to Expand

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tap_to_expand/tap_to_expand.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tap to Expand Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Tap to Expand Demo'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Using the TapToExpand widget to create an expandable section
              TapToExpand(
                title: Text("What is Flutter?"),
                content: Text("Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google."),
                backgroundColor: Colors.lightBlue[50],
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
                duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 16), // Adding space between expandable sections
              TapToExpand(
                title: Text("Why use Flutter?"),
                content: Text("Flutter allows for fast development, expressive UI, and native performance."),
                backgroundColor: Colors.lightGreen[50],
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
                duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Tap to Expand Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Padding widget to provide space around the content.
// 5. Inside the body, a Column widget is used to stack multiple TapToExpand widgets vertically.
// 6. Each TapToExpand widget has a title and content, which expands when tapped.
// 7. The background color and border radius are customizable for each TapToExpand widget.
// 8. The duration property controls the animation speed when expanding or collapsing the content.
