# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Super Text Layout

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **super_text_layout** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  super_text_layout: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:super_text_layout/super_text_layout.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `SuperText` widget to create complex text layouts. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
SuperText(
  text: 'Hello, Flutter! This is a demonstration of the super_text_layout package.',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.black),
  maxLines: 3,
  overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,
);
```

This widget will display the text with a maximum of three lines, truncating with an ellipsis if it exceeds that limit.

By following these steps, you can successfully set up and start using the **super_text_layout** package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Super Text Layout

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:super_text_layout/super_text_layout.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Super Text Layout Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Super Text Layout Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SuperText(
            text: 'Welcome to the Super Text Layout package! This package allows for advanced text formatting and layout options.',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18, color: Colors.blue),
            maxLines: 2, // Limit the text to 2 lines
            overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis, // Add ellipsis if text overflows
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a title and a home widget, which is a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold has an AppBar with a title and a body that centers the SuperText widget.
// 5. The SuperText widget displays a welcome message with a specified text style.
// 6. The text is limited to 2 lines, and if it exceeds this limit, it will show an ellipsis at the end.
```
