# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Liquid Progress Indicator V2

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `liquid_progress_indicator_v2` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  liquid_progress_indicator_v2: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:liquid_progress_indicator_v2/liquid_progress_indicator_v2.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Widget
You can now use the `LiquidCircularProgressIndicator` or `LiquidLinearProgressIndicator` in your widget tree. Here’s a basic example of how to implement it:

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing the Indicator
You can customize the appearance of the liquid progress indicator by adjusting its properties, such as `value`, `backgroundColor`, and `valueColor`.

### Example Usage
Here’s a simple example of how to use the `LiquidCircularProgressIndicator`:

```dart
LiquidCircularProgressIndicator(
  value: 0.5, // Progress value from 0.0 to 1.0
  valueColor: AlwaysStoppedAnimation(Colors.blue), // Color of the liquid
  backgroundColor: Colors.white, // Background color
  borderColor: Colors.blueAccent, // Border color
  borderWidth: 5.0, // Border width
  direction: Axis.vertical, // Direction of the liquid flow
  center: Text("50%"), // Center widget
)
```

This will create a circular liquid progress indicator that fills up to 50% with a blue liquid.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `liquid_progress_indicator_v2` package into your Flutter application and customize it to fit your needs.

# Complete Example of Liquid Progress Indicator V2

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:liquid_progress_indicator_v2/liquid_progress_indicator_v2.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Liquid Progress Indicator Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Liquid Progress Indicator'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: LiquidCircularProgressIndicator(
            value: 0.7, // Progress value from 0.0 to 1.0
            valueColor: AlwaysStoppedAnimation(Colors.green), // Color of the liquid
            backgroundColor: Colors.white, // Background color
            borderColor: Colors.greenAccent, // Border color
            borderWidth: 5.0, // Border width
            direction: Axis.vertical, // Direction of the liquid flow
            center: Text("70%"), // Center widget
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Liquid Progress Indicator".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a LiquidCircularProgressIndicator.
// 5. The LiquidCircularProgressIndicator is configured to show 70% progress with a green liquid.
// 6. The background is white, and the border is greenAccent with a width of 5.0.
// 7. The center of the indicator displays the text "70%" to indicate the current progress visually.
