# Local Shared: A Flutter Package for Local Storage

The `local_shared` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to manage local storage efficiently. It provides a simple and intuitive API for storing key-value pairs, making it ideal for applications that require persistent data storage. Whether you need to save user preferences, app settings, or any other small amounts of data, `local_shared` can help streamline the process.

## When to Use `local_shared`
- **User Preferences**: Store user settings such as themes, language preferences, or notification settings.
- **Session Data**: Keep track of user sessions or temporary data that needs to persist across app restarts.
- **Caching**: Cache data fetched from APIs to improve performance and reduce network calls.

## Key Features
- **Simple API**: Easy-to-use methods for storing and retrieving data.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Data Types**: Supports various data types, including strings, integers, and booleans.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking operations to ensure smooth user experience.

# Setting Up and Using `local_shared`

## Installation
To add the `local_shared` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  local_shared: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. The package will work out of the box.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you plan to access sensitive data. However, for basic storage, no special permissions are needed.

## Basic Usage
To use the `local_shared` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:local_shared/local_shared.dart';
```

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the package to store and retrieve data:

```dart
void main() async {
  // Initialize the LocalShared instance
  final localStorage = LocalShared();

  // Store a value
  await localStorage.setString('username', 'RealFlutter');

  // Retrieve the value
  String? username = await localStorage.getString('username');
  print('Username: $username'); // Output: Username: RealFlutter
}
```

This example demonstrates how to store a string value and retrieve it later. The `setString` method saves the data, while `getString` retrieves it.

# Complete Example of Using `local_shared`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:local_shared/local_shared.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Local Shared Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  final LocalShared localStorage = LocalShared(); // Create an instance of LocalShared
  String _username = ''; // Variable to hold the username

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _loadUsername(); // Load the username when the widget is initialized
  }

  // Function to load the username from local storage
  Future<void> _loadUsername() async {
    String? username = await localStorage.getString('username'); // Retrieve the username
    setState(() {
      _username = username ?? ''; // Update the state with the retrieved username
    });
  }

  // Function to save the username to local storage
  Future<void> _saveUsername(String username) async {
    await localStorage.setString('username', username); // Store the username
    _loadUsername(); // Reload the username to update the UI
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Local Shared Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              onChanged: (value) {
                _username = value; // Update the username variable as the user types
              },
              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your username'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                _saveUsername(_username); // Save the username when the button is pressed
              },
              child: Text('Save Username'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Saved Username: $_username'), // Display the saved username
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// The HomeScreen is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the username.
// In the initState method, we call _loadUsername to retrieve any previously saved username from local storage.
// The _loadUsername function uses the getString method to fetch the username and updates the state.
// The build method creates a simple UI with a TextField for user input and a button to save the username.
// When the button is pressed, the _saveUsername function is called, which stores the username using setString.
// The saved username is displayed below the button, updating dynamically as the user interacts with the app.
