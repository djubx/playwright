# Stream_with_value Flutter Package

The `stream_with_value` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to manage streams of data efficiently. It allows you to create a stream that can emit both initial values and subsequent updates, making it particularly useful for scenarios where you need to provide an initial state to your UI before any asynchronous data is available.

## When to Use This Package
- **Real-time Data Updates**: When your application requires real-time updates from a data source, such as a chat application or live score updates.
- **Initial State Management**: When you want to provide an initial value to your UI while waiting for data to be fetched asynchronously.
- **Reactive Programming**: When you are implementing reactive programming patterns in your Flutter application.

## Features
- **Initial Value Support**: Easily emit an initial value along with subsequent updates.
- **Stream Management**: Simplifies the management of streams, making it easier to handle data flow in your application.
- **Integration with Flutter**: Works seamlessly with Flutter's reactive framework, allowing for smooth UI updates.

Overall, `stream_with_value` is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with efficient stream management capabilities.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Stream_with_value

## Installation
To get started with the `stream_with_value` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  stream_with_value: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `stream_with_value` package is designed to work on both Android and iOS without any additional platform-specific configurations. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms.

## Basic Usage
To use the `stream_with_value` package, you will typically create a `StreamWithValue` instance, providing it with an initial value and a stream of updates. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stream_with_value/stream_with_value.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a StreamWithValue instance with an initial value
    final streamWithValue = StreamWithValue<int>(0);

    // Add a listener to the stream
    streamWithValue.stream.listen((value) {
      // Handle the incoming value
      print('New value: $value');
    });

    // Update the stream with a new value
    streamWithValue.add(1);
    streamWithValue.add(2);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stream with Value Example')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Check console for stream updates')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a `StreamWithValue` instance with an initial value of `0`, listen for updates, and then add new values to the stream. The UI will remain responsive while the stream updates occur in the background.

# Complete Example of Stream_with_value

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stream_with_value/stream_with_value.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a StreamWithValue instance with an initial value of 0
  final StreamWithValue<int> streamWithValue = StreamWithValue<int>(0);
  int currentValue = 0; // Variable to hold the current value

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Listen to the stream for updates
    streamWithValue.stream.listen((value) {
      // Update the current value and rebuild the UI
      setState(() {
        currentValue = value;
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stream with Value Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('Current Value: $currentValue'), // Display the current value
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Add a new value to the stream when the button is pressed
                  streamWithValue.add(currentValue + 1);
                },
                child: Text('Increment Value'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we create a StreamWithValue instance with an initial value of 0.
// 3. We also define a variable `currentValue` to hold the current value emitted by the stream.
// 4. In the `initState` method, we listen to the stream for any updates. When a new value is emitted, we update the `currentValue` and call `setState` to rebuild the UI.
// 5. The UI consists of a Text widget that displays the current value and a button to increment the value.
// 6. When the button is pressed, we add a new value to the stream, which triggers the listener and updates the displayed value.
// 7. The application remains responsive, and the UI updates seamlessly as new values are emitted from the stream.
