# Yandex Maps MapKit Flutter Package

The `yandex_maps_mapkit` Flutter package is a powerful tool for integrating Yandex Maps into your Flutter applications. It provides a rich set of features that allow developers to display maps, add markers, and interact with map elements seamlessly. This package is particularly useful for applications that require geolocation services, route planning, or any functionality that benefits from map visualization.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `yandex_maps_mapkit` package in scenarios such as:
- **Location-based Services**: If your app needs to show user locations, nearby points of interest, or navigation routes.
- **Travel and Tourism Apps**: For displaying maps of tourist attractions, hotels, and routes.
- **Delivery and Logistics**: To visualize delivery routes and track shipments in real-time.

## Key Features
- **Map Display**: Render Yandex Maps in your Flutter application.
- **Markers and Polylines**: Add custom markers and draw polylines to represent routes.

# Tutorial: Setting Up Yandex Maps MapKit

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `yandex_maps_mapkit` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `yandex_maps_mapkit` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  yandex_maps_mapkit: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/yandex_maps_mapkit).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the following permissions and metadata to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.yandex.maps.api.key"
            android:value="YOUR_YANDEX_MAPS_API_KEY"/>
    </application>

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
</manifest>
```

2. **Obtain Yandex Maps API Key**: You need to register your application on the Yandex Developer Console to obtain an API key.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show it on the map.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show it on the map.</string>
<key>YMKMapKitApiKey</key>
<string>YOUR_YANDEX_MAPS_API_KEY</string>
```

2. **Obtain Yandex Maps API Key**: Similar to Android, register your application on the Yandex Developer Console to get your API key.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. 

### Basic Usage Example

You can create a simple map view using the following code snippet:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:yandex_maps_mapkit/yandex_maps_mapkit.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Yandex Maps Example')),
        body: YandexMap(
          onMapCreated: (YandexMapController controller) {
            // Map is created, you can add markers or perform other actions here
          },
          onMapTap: (point) {
            // Handle map tap events
            print('Map tapped at: $point');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes a basic Yandex Map and sets up a listener for map tap events.

# Complete Example: Yandex Maps in Flutter

Below is a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the `yandex_maps_mapkit` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:yandex_maps_mapkit/yandex_maps_mapkit.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Yandex Maps Example')),
        body: YandexMap(
          onMapCreated: (YandexMapController controller) {
            // This callback is triggered when the map is created
            // You can add markers or perform other actions here
            _addMarker(controller);
          },
          onMapTap: (point) {
            // Handle map tap events
            print('Map tapped at: $point');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to add a marker on the map
  void _addMarker(YandexMapController controller) async {
    // Create a marker at a specific location
    final marker = PlacemarkMapObject(
      mapId: MapObjectId('marker_id'),
      point: Point(latitude: 55.751244, longitude: 37.618423), // Moscow coordinates
      icon: PlacemarkIcon.single(PlacemarkIconStyle(
        image: BitmapDescriptor.fromAssetImage('assets/marker.png'),
        rotationType: RotationType.map,
        scale: 1.0,
      )),
    );

    // Add the marker to the map
    await controller.addPlacemark(marker);
  }
}

// Application flow explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The YandexMap widget is created, and the onMapCreated callback is triggered when the map is ready.
// 3. Inside the onMapCreated callback, we call _addMarker to place a marker on the map.
// 4. The _addMarker function creates a PlacemarkMapObject at specified coordinates (Moscow in this case).
// 5. The marker is added to the map using the controller's addPlacemark method.
// 6. The app also listens for map tap events, printing the tapped location to the console.
```
