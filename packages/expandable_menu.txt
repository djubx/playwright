```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  expandable_menu: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file where you want to use the expandable menu, import the package:

```dart

```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the **expandable_menu** in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:expandable_menu/expandable_menu.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Expandable Menu Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ExpandableMenu(
            title: 'Menu',
            items: [
              MenuItem(title: 'Item 1', onTap: () => print('Item 1 tapped')),
              MenuItem(title: 'Item 2', onTap: () => print('Item 2 tapped')),
              MenuItem(title: 'Item 3', onTap: () => print('Item 3 tapped')),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
  
  ```gradle
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
          ...
          minSdkVersion 21
      }
  }
  ```

- **iOS**: For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

  ```ruby
  platform :ios, '10.0'
  ```

## Step 5: Customization and Optimization

You can customize the appearance of the expandable menu by modifying properties such as `backgroundColor`, `textColor`, and `iconColor`. Additionally, consider optimizing the performance by using `const` constructors where applicable.

# Complete Example of Expandable Menu

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:expandable_menu/expandable_menu.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Expandable Menu Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ExpandableMenu(
            title: 'Menu', // Title of the expandable menu
            items: [
              MenuItem(
                title: 'Item 1', // First menu item
                onTap: () => print('Item 1 tapped'), // Action on tap
              ),
              MenuItem(
                title: 'Item 2', // Second menu item
                onTap: () => print('Item 2 tapped'), // Action on tap
              ),
              MenuItem(
                title: 'Item 3', // Third menu item
                onTap: () => print('Item 3 tapped'), // Action on tap
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Expandable Menu Example'.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, we center the ExpandableMenu widget.
// 5. The ExpandableMenu has a title 'Menu' and three items.
// 6. Each item has a title and an onTap action that prints a message to the console when tapped.
// 7. The user can tap on the menu items to see the actions being triggered, demonstrating the functionality of the expandable menu.
