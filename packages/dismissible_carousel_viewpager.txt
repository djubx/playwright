# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dismissible Carousel ViewPager

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `dismissible_carousel_viewpager` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `dismissible_carousel_viewpager` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dismissible_carousel_viewpager: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `dismissible_carousel_viewpager`.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dismissible_carousel_viewpager/dismissible_carousel_viewpager.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dismissible Carousel Example',
      home: CarouselPage(),
    );
  }
}

class CarouselPage extends StatelessWidget {
  // Sample data for the carousel
  final List<String> items = [
    'Item 1',
    'Item 2',
    'Item 3',
    'Item 4',
    'Item 5',
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dismissible Carousel ViewPager'),
      ),
      body: DismissibleCarouselViewPager(
        // The list of items to display in the carousel
        items: items,
        // The builder function to create each item widget
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return Card(
            color: Colors.blueAccent,
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                items[index],
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.white),
              ),
            ),
          );
        },
        // Callback when an item is dismissed
        onDismissed: (index) {
          // Show a snackbar or perform any action after dismissal
          ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
            SnackBar(content: Text('${items[index]} dismissed')),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets CarouselPage as the home widget.
// 3. CarouselPage contains a list of items to display in the carousel.
// 4. The DismissibleCarouselViewPager widget is used to create the carousel.
// 5. Each item in the carousel is built using the itemBuilder function, which returns a Card widget with the item text.
// 6. When an item is dismissed, the onDismissed callback is triggered, showing a snackbar notification.
```
