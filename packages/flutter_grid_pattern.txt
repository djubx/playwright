# flutter_grid_pattern Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_grid_pattern` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_grid_pattern: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_grid_pattern).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_grid_pattern` package, you can start by importing it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_grid_pattern/flutter_grid_pattern.dart';
```

You can then create a grid layout using the `GridPattern` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
GridPattern(
  rows: 3,
  columns: 3,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return Container(
      color: Colors.blue,
      child: Center(child: Text('Item $index')),
    );
  },
)
```

This code snippet creates a 3x3 grid where each cell contains a blue container with centered text.

# Complete Example of flutter_grid_pattern

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_grid_pattern/flutter_grid_pattern.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Grid Pattern Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Grid Pattern Example'),
        ),
        body: GridPattern(
          rows: 3, // Define the number of rows in the grid
          columns: 3, // Define the number of columns in the grid
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            // Build each grid item
            return Container(
              margin: EdgeInsets.all(8.0), // Add margin around each item
              color: Colors.blue[(index + 1) * 100], // Color based on index
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Item $index', // Display item index
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Grid Pattern Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a GridPattern widget, which creates a grid layout.
// 5. The grid is defined to have 3 rows and 3 columns.
// 6. The itemBuilder function is called for each grid cell, creating a Container with a margin.
// 7. Each Container is colored based on its index and contains centered text displaying the item index.
// 8. The result is a visually appealing grid layout with dynamic content based on the index.
