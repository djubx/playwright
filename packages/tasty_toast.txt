## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android

## Basic Usage
To use the **tasty_toast** package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart

  context: context,
  duration: TastyToast.lengthShort,
  gravity: TastyToast.gravityBottom,
);
```

### Customizing Toasts
You can customize the appearance of your toasts by specifying additional parameters:

```dart
TastyToast.show(
  'Success!',
  context: context,
  duration: TastyToast.lengthLong,

# Complete Example of Tasty Toast in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tasty_toast/tasty_toast.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Tasty Toast Example',
      home: ToastDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class ToastDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Tasty Toast Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show a success toast when the button is pressed
            TastyToast.show(
              'Operation Successful!',
              context: context,
              duration: TastyToast.lengthShort,
              gravity: TastyToast.gravityBottom,
              backgroundColor: Colors.green,
              textColor: Colors.white,
              fontSize: 16.0,
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Toast'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (ToastDemo).
// 3. ToastDemo creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 5. When the button is pressed, a toast notification is displayed using TastyToast.show().
// 6. The toast appears at the bottom of the screen, indicating a successful operation with a green background and white text.
