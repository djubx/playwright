# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the pdfx Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `pdfx` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pdfx: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/pdfx).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or latest version
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.github.barteksc:android-pdf-viewer:3.2.0-beta.1' // or latest version
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # or higher
```

Then, run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to display a PDF document.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pdfx/pdfx.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('PDF Viewer Example'),
        ),
        body: PdfView(
          controller: PdfController(
            document: PdfDocument.openAsset('assets/sample.pdf'), // Load PDF from assets
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a PDF document from the assets folder. Make sure to add the PDF file to your `assets` directory and declare it in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/sample.pdf
```

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `pdfx` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Using the pdfx Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pdfx/pdfx.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PDF Viewer Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('PDF Viewer'),
        ),
        body: PdfView(
          controller: PdfController(
            document: PdfDocument.openAsset('assets/sample.pdf'), // Load PDF from assets
            initialPage: 0, // Start on the first page
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main structure of the app.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 4. The AppBar displays the title "PDF Viewer".
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a PdfView widget.
// 6. The PdfView is controlled by a PdfController, which loads a PDF document from the assets folder.
// 7. The initialPage property is set to 0, meaning the PDF will start displaying from the first page.
// 8. Finally, the runApp function is called to launch the application with the RealFlutter widget.
```
