# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Rainbow Color Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the **rainbow_color** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  rainbow_color: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:rainbow_color/rainbow_color.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
You can now use the **rainbow_color** package in your Flutter widgets. Below are platform-specific details for Android and iOS:

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Implementing Rainbow Colors
You can use the `RainbowColor` widget to create a gradient effect. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
RainbowColor(
  colors: [Colors.red, Colors.orange, Colors.yellow, Colors.green, Colors.blue, Colors.indigo, Colors.violet],
  duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
  child: Container(
    height: 200,
    width: double.infinity,
  ),
)
```

This code snippet creates a container with a rainbow gradient that transitions over 2 seconds.

With these steps, you are now ready to implement the **rainbow_color** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the Rainbow Color Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rainbow_color/rainbow_color.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Rainbow Color Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Rainbow Color Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Using the RainbowColor widget to create a colorful background
          child: RainbowColor(
            colors: [
              Colors.red,
              Colors.orange,
              Colors.yellow,
              Colors.green,
              Colors.blue,
              Colors.indigo,
              Colors.violet
            ],
            duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration for color transition
            child: Container(
              height: 200, // Height of the container
              width: double.infinity, // Full width
              alignment: Alignment.center,
              child: Text(
                'Hello, Rainbow!',
                style: TextStyle(
                  fontSize: 24,
                  fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                  color: Colors.white, // Text color
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Rainbow Color Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a RainbowColor widget.
// 5. The RainbowColor widget takes a list of colors and a duration for the transition.
// 6. Inside the RainbowColor, a Container is defined with a height of 200 and full width.
// 7. The Container is centered and contains a Text widget that displays 'Hello, Rainbow!'.
// 8. The text is styled to be bold and white, making it stand out against the colorful background.
```
