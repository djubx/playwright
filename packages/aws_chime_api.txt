# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using aws_chime_api

## Installation
To get started with the `aws_chime_api` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  aws_chime_api: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/aws_chime_api).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

2. **Minimum SDK Version**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio calls.</string>
```

2. **Deployment Target**: Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 11.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize a Chime session and join a meeting.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:aws_chime_api/aws_chime_api.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late ChimeService chimeService;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    chimeService = ChimeService();
    // Initialize the Chime service
    chimeService.initialize();
  }

  void joinMeeting(String meetingId) async {
    // Join a meeting using the meeting ID
    await chimeService.joinMeeting(meetingId);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('AWS Chime API Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => joinMeeting('your_meeting_id'),
          child: Text('Join Meeting'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the Chime service and provides a button to join a meeting. Make sure to replace `'your_meeting_id'` with a valid meeting ID.

# Complete Example of Using aws_chime_api

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:aws_chime_api/aws_chime_api.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late ChimeService chimeService;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    chimeService = ChimeService();
    // Initialize the Chime service
    chimeService.initialize();
  }

  void joinMeeting(String meetingId) async {
    // Join a meeting using the meeting ID
    await chimeService.joinMeeting(meetingId);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('AWS Chime API Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => joinMeeting('your_meeting_id'),
          child: Text('Join Meeting'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, we create an instance of ChimeService and initialize it.
// 3. The build method creates a simple UI with an AppBar and a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the joinMeeting method is called with a meeting ID.
// 5. The joinMeeting method uses the ChimeService to join the specified meeting.
