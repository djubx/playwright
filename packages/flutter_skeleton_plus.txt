# Getting Started with Flutter Skeleton Plus

## Installation
To add `flutter_skeleton_plus` to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_skeleton_plus: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_skeleton_plus).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the latest version of Xcode installed. No additional configurations are necessary for using `flutter_skeleton_plus`.

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you can create a skeleton loader in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_skeleton_plus/flutter_skeleton_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Skeleton Loader Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: SkeletonLoader(
          children: [
            SkeletonAvatar(),
            SkeletonLine(),
            SkeletonLine(),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple skeleton loader with an avatar and two lines representing text. The `SkeletonLoader` widget wraps the skeleton components, which will be displayed while the actual content is loading.

With this setup, you can easily integrate skeleton loaders into your Flutter applications, providing a better user experience during data fetching.

# Complete Example of Flutter Skeleton Plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_skeleton_plus/flutter_skeleton_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Skeleton Loader Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isLoading = true; // State variable to control loading

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Simulate a network call
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3), () {
      setState(() {
        _isLoading = false; // Update loading state after data is fetched
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Skeleton Loader Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: _isLoading
            ? SkeletonLoader( // Show skeleton loader while loading
                children: [
                  SkeletonAvatar(), // Placeholder for avatar
                  SkeletonLine(),   // Placeholder for text line
                  SkeletonLine(),   // Another placeholder for text line
                ],
              )
            : Column( // Actual content displayed after loading
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: [
                  CircleAvatar(radius: 50, backgroundImage: NetworkImage('https://example.com/image.jpg')),
                  SizedBox(height: 20),
                  Text('Content Loaded!', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
                  Text('Here is your data.', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16)),
                ],
              ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and it directs to the RealFlutter widget.
// RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that manages its loading state.
// In the initState method, we simulate a network call with a delay of 3 seconds.
// While loading, the SkeletonLoader is displayed with an avatar and two lines as placeholders.
// After the delay, the loading state is set to false, and the actual content is displayed.
// The content includes a CircleAvatar and two Text widgets, indicating that the data has been loaded successfully.
