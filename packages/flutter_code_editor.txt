# Flutter Code Editor: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_code_editor` package is a powerful tool for developers looking to integrate a code editing interface within their Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require users to write, edit, or review code snippets directly within the app. It is ideal for educational apps, coding platforms, or any application that benefits from an embedded code editor.

## Key Features

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Supports multiple programming languages, providing a rich editing experience with syntax highlighting.
- **Customizable Themes**: Offers various themes to match the look and feel of your application.
- **Auto-completion**: Enhances user productivity by suggesting code completions.
- **Error Highlighting**: Identifies and highlights syntax errors in real-time.
- **Line Numbers**: Displays line numbers for easy navigation and reference.

## When to Use

- **Educational Apps**: Perfect for apps that teach programming by allowing users to write and test code.
- **Developer Tools**: Useful for creating tools that require code input or modification.
- **Prototyping**: Allows quick prototyping of code snippets within a mobile environment.

# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Code Editor

Integrating the `flutter_code_editor` package into your Flutter project is straightforward. This section will guide you through the setup process and demonstrate how to use the package effectively.

## Installation

To get started, add the `flutter_code_editor` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_code_editor: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Basic Setup

### Android Configuration

Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure your deployment target is set to at least iOS 11.0. You can set this in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

## Using the Package

To use the `flutter_code_editor`, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_code_editor/flutter_code_editor.dart';
```

### Creating a Code Editor

Here's a simple example of how to create a code editor using the `RealFlutter` class:

```dart
RealFlutter(
  language: 'dart',
  theme: CodeEditorTheme.light(),
  onTextChanged: (String code) {
    print('Code changed: $code');
  },
)
```

This snippet sets up a basic code editor with Dart syntax highlighting and a light theme. The `onTextChanged` callback is triggered whenever the code is modified.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_code_editor/flutter_code_editor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Code Editor Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CodeEditorScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CodeEditorScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CodeEditorScreenState createState() => _CodeEditorScreenState();
}

class _CodeEditorScreenState extends State<CodeEditorScreen> {
  String _code = 'void main() {\n  print("Hello, World!");\n}';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Code Editor'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
        child: RealFlutter(
          language: 'dart', // Set the language for syntax highlighting
          theme: CodeEditorTheme.dark(), // Choose a theme for the editor
          text: _code, // Initial code to display in the editor
          onTextChanged: (String newCode) {
            setState(() {
              _code = newCode; // Update the code state when text changes
            });
          },
          onError: (List<CodeEditorError> errors) {
            // Handle syntax errors
            if (errors.isNotEmpty) {
              print('Errors: ${errors.map((e) => e.message).join(', ')}');
            }
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code sets up a basic Flutter application with a code editor screen.
// The `RealFlutter` widget is used to create a code editor with Dart syntax highlighting.
// The initial code displayed is a simple Dart program that prints "Hello, World!".
// The `onTextChanged` callback updates the `_code` state whenever the user modifies the code.
// The `onError` callback prints any syntax errors detected in the code editor.

// Application Flow:
// 1. The `MyApp` class initializes the Flutter application and sets the home screen to `CodeEditorScreen`.
// 2. `CodeEditorScreen` is a stateful widget that manages the state of the code being edited.
// 3. The `RealFlutter` widget is configured with Dart language support and a dark theme.
// 4. The initial code is set to a simple Dart program.
// 5. As the user edits the code, the `onTextChanged` callback updates the `_code` variable.
// 6. Any syntax errors are captured and printed using the `onError` callback.
