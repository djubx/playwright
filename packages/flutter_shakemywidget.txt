# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_shakemywidget`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_shakemywidget` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_shakemywidget: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable the shake gesture in your `Info.plist` file. Add the following key-value pair:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the shake-to-refresh functionality.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_shakemywidget/flutter_shakemywidget.dart';
```

2. Wrap your widget with `ShakeMyWidget` and define the refresh action:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Shake My Widget Example')),
        body: ShakeMyWidget(
          onShake: () {
            // Define what happens when the widget is shaken
            print('Widget shaken! Refreshing data...');
            // Add your refresh logic here
          },
          child: Center(
            child: Text('Shake me to refresh!'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

With these steps, you have successfully integrated the `flutter_shakemywidget` package into your Flutter application. You can now shake your device to trigger the refresh action defined in the `onShake` callback.

# Complete Example of `flutter_shakemywidget`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_shakemywidget/flutter_shakemywidget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Shake My Widget Example')),
        body: ShakeMyWidget(
          onShake: () {
            // This function is called when the widget is shaken
            print('Widget shaken! Refreshing data...');
            // Here you can add your logic to refresh data
          },
          child: Center(
            child: Text('Shake me to refresh!'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Shake My Widget Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold wraps a Center widget that contains a Text widget.
// 5. The ShakeMyWidget widget wraps the Center widget, listening for shake gestures.
// 6. When the device is shaken, the onShake callback is triggered, printing a message to the console.
// 7. You can replace the print statement with any logic to refresh your data or UI.
```
