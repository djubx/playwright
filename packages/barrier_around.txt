# Tutorial
==========

## Setup

To use the `barrier_around` package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  barrier_around: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Usage

To add a barrier around a widget, wrap it with the `BarrierAround` widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:barrier_around/barrier_around.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BarrierAround(
      child: Container(
        width: 200,
        height: 200,
        color: Colors.red,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

You can customize the barrier color and opacity by using the `barrierColor` and `barrierOpacity` properties:

```dart
BarrierAround(
  barrierColor: Colors.black,
  barrierOpacity: 0.5,
  child: Container(
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
    color: Colors.red,
  ),
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

The `barrier_around` package uses the `Stack` widget to create the barrier. On Android, the `Stack` widget uses the `ViewGroup` to manage its children, while on iOS, it uses the `UIView`. This means that the barrier may behave slightly differently on each platform.

### Required Configurations or Optimizations

There are no required configurations or optimizations for using the `barrier_around` package. However, you may want to consider adding a background color to the barrier to make it more visible.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:barrier_around/barrier_around.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Barrier Around Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a Scaffold to provide a basic material design layout
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Barrier Around Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Use the BarrierAround widget to add a barrier around the Container
        child: BarrierAround(
          // Customize the barrier color and opacity
          barrierColor: Colors.black,
          barrierOpacity: 0.5,
          // Create a Container to demonstrate the barrier
          child: Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 200,
            color: Colors.red,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a basic material design layout.
// 2. The BarrierAround widget is used to add a barrier around the Container.
// 3. The barrier color and opacity are customized to make it more visible.
// 4. The Container is used to demonstrate the barrier.
// 5. When the user interacts with the app, the barrier prevents them from interacting with other widgets outside of the Container.

// In summary, the BarrierAround widget is used to add a barrier around a widget, preventing users from interacting with other widgets outside of it. The barrier color and opacity can be customized to make it more visible.
