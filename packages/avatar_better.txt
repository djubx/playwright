# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Avatar Better

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `avatar_better` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  avatar_better: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:avatar_better/avatar_better.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Avatar Widget

You can now use the `Avatar` widget in your application. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
Avatar(
  name: 'John Doe',
  photo: 'https://example.com/johndoe.jpg',
  placeHolder: Text('JD'),
  shape: AvatarShape.circle,
  borderColor: Colors.blue,
  borderWidth: 2.0,
);
```

This code creates a circular avatar for a user named John Doe, with a placeholder text of "JD" if the image fails to load.

## Step 6: Customizing the Avatar

You can customize the avatar further by adjusting its properties, such as size, border, and shadow. Here’s an example:

```dart
Avatar(
  name: 'Jane Smith',
  photo: 'https://example.com/janesmith.jpg',
  shape: AvatarShape.square,
  size: 100.0,
  borderColor: Colors.red,
  borderWidth: 3.0,
  shadow: [
    BoxShadow(
      color: Colors.black26,
      blurRadius: 5.0,
      offset: Offset(0, 2),
    ),
  ],
);
```

This creates a square avatar with a size of 100 pixels, a red border, and a shadow effect.

With these steps, you can effectively set up and use the `avatar_better` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using Avatar Better

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:avatar_better/avatar_better.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Avatar Better Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Avatar Better Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Displaying a circular avatar with a photo
              Avatar(
                name: 'John Doe',
                photo: 'https://example.com/johndoe.jpg',
                placeHolder: Text('JD'),
                shape: AvatarShape.circle,
                borderColor: Colors.blue,
                borderWidth: 2.0,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between avatars
              // Displaying a square avatar with a placeholder
              Avatar(
                name: 'Jane Smith',
                placeHolder: Text('JS'),
                shape: AvatarShape.square,
                size: 100.0,
                borderColor: Colors.red,
                borderWidth: 3.0,
                shadow: [
                  BoxShadow(
                    color: Colors.black26,
                    blurRadius: 5.0,
                    offset: Offset(0, 2),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the avatars vertically.
// 5. The first Avatar widget displays a circular avatar for John Doe with a photo.
// 6. The second Avatar widget displays a square avatar for Jane Smith with a placeholder.
// 7. The SizedBox widget adds space between the two avatars for better visual separation.
```
