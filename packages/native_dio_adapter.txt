Here's a detailed technical blog on the `native_dio_adapter` Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Native Dio Adapter Flutter Package

The `native_dio_adapter` is a Flutter package that provides a native HTTP client for the Dio library, allowing developers to leverage the performance and capabilities of native HTTP clients on both Android and iOS platforms. This package is particularly useful when you need to make network requests in a Flutter application while ensuring optimal performance and compatibility with native features.

## When to Use This Package

- **Performance-Critical Applications**: If your application requires high-performance network requests, using the native adapter can significantly improve response times and reduce latency.
- **Native Features**: When you need to access platform-specific features such as caching, cookies, or advanced networking capabilities that are not available in the default Dio implementation.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: If you want to maintain consistent behavior across Android and iOS while utilizing the best practices of each platform.

## Features

- **Native HTTP Client**: Utilizes the native HTTP clients of Android (OkHttp) and iOS (NSURLSession) for improved performance.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate with existing Dio setups, allowing for a seamless transition to using native capabilities.
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling that leverages native error codes and messages.
- **Support for Interceptors**: Allows the use of Dio's interceptors for request and response manipulation.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Native Dio Adapter

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `native_dio_adapter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dio: ^5.0.0
  native_dio_adapter: ^0.1.0
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
       }
   }
   ```

2. No additional permissions are required for basic HTTP requests, but if you plan to use features like caching, ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`.

### iOS

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following to allow arbitrary loads (if needed for testing):

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now, you can set up the `native_dio_adapter` in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:native_dio_adapter/native_dio_adapter.dart';

void main() {
  // Create a Dio instance
  final dio = Dio();

  // Set the native adapter
  dio.httpClientAdapter = NativeDioAdapter();

  // Example GET request
  fetchData(dio);
}

Future<void> fetchData(Dio dio) async {
  try {
    final response = await dio.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
    print(response.data);
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error: $e');
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a `Dio` instance, set the `NativeDioAdapter`, and make a simple GET request to fetch data from a placeholder API.

# Complete Example of Using Native Dio Adapter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:native_dio_adapter/native_dio_adapter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Native Dio Adapter Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  final Dio dio = Dio(); // Create a Dio instance

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    dio.httpClientAdapter = NativeDioAdapter(); // Set the native adapter
    fetchData(); // Fetch data when the widget is initialized
  }

  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    try {
      // Make a GET request to the API
      final response = await dio.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
      // Print the response data
      print(response.data);
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors
      print('Error: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Native Dio Adapter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Check console for output!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. The HomePage widget is a StatefulWidget that initializes a Dio instance in its state.
// 4. In the initState method, the NativeDioAdapter is set for the Dio instance.
// 5. The fetchData method is called to make a GET request to the JSON placeholder API.
// 6. The response data is printed to the console, and any errors are caught and printed.
// 7. The UI displays a simple message indicating to check the console for output.
