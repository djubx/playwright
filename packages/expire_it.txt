# Expire_it Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The `expire_it` package is a powerful tool for managing expiration dates and timeouts in Flutter applications. It allows developers to easily set expiration times for various tasks, such as caching data, managing user sessions, or controlling the visibility of UI elements based on time constraints. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where time-sensitive operations are crucial, such as in e-commerce applications, social media platforms, or any app that requires timely updates.

## Key Features
- **Simple API**: The package provides an intuitive API for setting and checking expiration times.
- **Flexible Expiration Handling**: You can define expiration in terms of seconds, minutes, or hours.
- **Callbacks**: Supports callbacks that can be triggered when an item expires.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing Flutter applications without complex configurations.

## When to Use
- When you need to manage session timeouts in user authentication.
- For caching data that should only be valid for a certain period.
- To control the visibility of UI elements based on time constraints.

Overall, `expire_it` is an essential package for any Flutter developer looking to implement time-sensitive features in their applications.

# Setting Up and Using the Expire_it Package

## Installation
To get started with the `expire_it` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  expire_it: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your application requires any specific capabilities related to time management.

## Basic Usage
To use the `expire_it` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:expire_it/expire_it.dart';
```

You can create an instance of the `ExpireIt` class and set an expiration time as follows:

```dart
void main() {
  final expireIt = ExpireIt();

  // Set an expiration time of 5 seconds
  expireIt.setExpiration(Duration(seconds: 5), () {
    print("Item has expired!");
  });

  // Check if the item is expired
  if (expireIt.isExpired()) {
    print("Item is expired.");
  } else {
    print("Item is still valid.");
  }
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to set an expiration time and check if the item has expired. The callback will be triggered once the expiration time is reached.

With this setup, you can easily manage expiration in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using Expire_it

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:expire_it/expire_it.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  final ExpireIt expireIt = ExpireIt(); // Create an instance of ExpireIt
  String message = "Item is valid."; // Initial message

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Set an expiration time of 5 seconds
    expireIt.setExpiration(Duration(seconds: 5), () {
      // Callback when the item expires
      setState(() {
        message = "Item has expired!"; // Update message on expiration
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text("Expire_it Example"),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(message), // Display the current message
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Check if the item is expired when button is pressed
                  if (expireIt.isExpired()) {
                    setState(() {
                      message = "Item is expired."; // Update message
                    });
                  } else {
                    setState(() {
                      message = "Item is still valid."; // Update message
                    });
                  }
                },
                child: Text("Check Expiration"),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the expire_it package.
// 1. The `RealFlutter` class is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the application.
// 2. In the `initState` method, we set an expiration time of 5 seconds for an item.
// 3. A callback is defined to update the message when the item expires.
// 4. The `build` method constructs the UI, displaying the current expiration status and a button to check the expiration.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it checks if the item is expired and updates the message accordingly.
// 6. The application will show "Item is valid." initially, and after 5 seconds, it will change to "Item has expired!".
// 7. Users can also manually check the expiration status by pressing the button, which will update the message based on the current state.
