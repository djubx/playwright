// This code demonstrates the basic usage of the ExpireIt package.
// It creates an instance of ExpireIt and stores some data with an expiration date.
// Then, it retrieves the data and prints it to the console.
// The data is stored in the app's shared preferences file on Android and NSUserDefaults on iOS.
// The expiration date is set to one day from the current date and time.
// When the data is retrieved, it is checked if it has expired.
// If it has expired, it is removed from storage.
// The code also shows how to use the ExpireIt package in a Flutter app.
// It creates a simple UI with two buttons to store and retrieve data.
// When the buttons are pressed, the corresponding actions are performed.
