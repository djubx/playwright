# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Image Picker Widget

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `image_picker_widget` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_picker_widget: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker_widget).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the required permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permissions:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select photos.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Image Picker Widget

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the image picker.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_picker_widget/image_picker_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: ImagePickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class ImagePickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImagePickerExampleState createState() => _ImagePickerExampleState();
}

class _ImagePickerExampleState extends State<ImagePickerExample> {
  String? _imagePath;

  void _pickImage() async {
    // Use the image picker to select an image
    final pickedFile = await ImagePickerWidget().pickImage();
    if (pickedFile != null) {
      setState(() {
        _imagePath = pickedFile.path; // Update the state with the selected image path
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Picker Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            _imagePath != null
                ? Image.file(File(_imagePath!)) // Display the selected image
                : Text('No image selected.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImage, // Trigger the image picker
              child: Text('Pick Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of Image Picker Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_picker_widget/image_picker_widget.dart';
import 'dart:io'; // Import for File handling

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: ImagePickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class ImagePickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImagePickerExampleState createState() => _ImagePickerExampleState();
}

class _ImagePickerExampleState extends State<ImagePickerExample> {
  String? _imagePath; // Variable to hold the image path

  void _pickImage() async {
    // Use the image picker to select an image
    final pickedFile = await ImagePickerWidget().pickImage();
    if (pickedFile != null) {
      setState(() {
        _imagePath = pickedFile.path; // Update the state with the selected image path
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Image Picker Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            _imagePath != null
                ? Image.file(File(_imagePath!)) // Display the selected image
                : Text('No image selected.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImage, // Trigger the image picker
              child: Text('Pick Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The ImagePickerExample widget is created, which manages the state of the selected image.
// 3. When the user taps the "Pick Image" button, the _pickImage method is called.
// 4. The image picker opens, allowing the user to select an image.
// 5. Once an image is selected, the state is updated, and the image is displayed on the screen.
// 6. If no image is selected, a message is shown indicating that no image has been selected.
```
