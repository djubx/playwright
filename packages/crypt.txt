Here's a detailed technical blog on the "crypt" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `crypt` Flutter package is a powerful library that provides cryptographic functions for Flutter applications. It allows developers to perform various cryptographic operations, such as hashing, encryption, and decryption, using a simple and intuitive API. This package is particularly useful for applications that require secure data storage, user authentication, or any functionality that involves sensitive information.

## When to Use the `crypt` Package

- **User Authentication**: When you need to securely hash passwords before storing them in a database.
- **Data Encryption**: For encrypting sensitive data before saving it locally or sending it over the network.
- **Secure Communication**: When implementing secure communication protocols that require data integrity and confidentiality.

## Features

- **Hashing**: Supports various hashing algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and more.
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Provides symmetric encryption using algorithms like AES.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter applications.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Android and iOS, ensuring consistent behavior across platforms.

The `crypt` package is a must-have for any Flutter developer looking to implement secure features in their applications.

## Setup Process

To use the `crypt` package in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `crypt` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     crypt: ^3.0.1  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```groovy
     android {
         ...
         defaultConfig {
             ...
             minSdkVersion 21
         }
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: No additional configuration is required for iOS, but ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed.

## Using the Package

Here’s a simple example of how to use the `crypt` package for hashing and encrypting data:

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:crypt/crypt.dart';
   ```

2. **Hashing a Password**:

   ```dart
   String password = "my_secure_password";
   String hashedPassword = Crypt.sha256(password).toString();
   ```

3. **Encrypting Data**:

   ```dart
   String key = "my_secret_key";
   String data = "Sensitive data";
   String encryptedData = Crypt.aesEncrypt(data, key);
   ```

4. **Decrypting Data**:

   ```dart
   String decryptedData = Crypt.aesDecrypt(encryptedData, key);
   ```

This setup allows you to securely hash passwords and encrypt sensitive data in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example

Here’s a complete Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the `crypt` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:crypt/crypt.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Crypt Package Example',
      home: CryptExample(),
    );
  }
}

class CryptExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CryptExampleState createState() => _CryptExampleState();
}

class _CryptExampleState extends State<CryptExample> {
  String password = "my_secure_password"; // The password to hash
  String hashedPassword = ""; // Variable to store the hashed password
  String key = "my_secret_key"; // Key for encryption
  String data = "Sensitive data"; // Data to encrypt
  String encryptedData = ""; // Variable to store encrypted data
  String decryptedData = ""; // Variable to store decrypted data

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Hash the password
    hashedPassword = Crypt.sha256(password).toString();
    // Encrypt the data
    encryptedData = Crypt.aesEncrypt(data, key);
    // Decrypt the data
    decryptedData = Crypt.aesDecrypt(encryptedData, key);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Crypt Package Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: [
            Text('Original Password: $password'),
            Text('Hashed Password: $hashedPassword'),
            Text('Original Data: $data'),
            Text('Encrypted Data: $encryptedData'),
            Text('Decrypted Data: $decryptedData'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to CryptExample.
// 3. In the CryptExample stateful widget, we define variables for password, hashed password, key, data, encrypted data, and decrypted data.
// 4. In the initState method, we hash the password using SHA-256, encrypt the data using AES, and then decrypt it back to verify the process.
// 5. The build method displays the original password, hashed password, original data, encrypted data, and decrypted data in a column layout.
```
