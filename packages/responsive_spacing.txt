# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Responsive Spacing Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **responsive_spacing** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  responsive_spacing: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:responsive_spacing/responsive_spacing.dart';
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, make sure your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the **responsive_spacing** package in your widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
Container(
  padding: ResponsiveSpacing.all(16), // Responsive padding
  child: Text('Hello, World!'),
);
```

This will apply a responsive padding of 16 units, which will adjust based on the screen size.

## Conclusion

The **responsive_spacing** package is a valuable addition to any Flutter project that requires responsive design. By following the steps above, you can easily integrate it into your application and start using its features to create adaptive layouts.

# Complete Example of Using the Responsive Spacing Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:responsive_spacing/responsive_spacing.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Responsive Spacing Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Responsive Spacing Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Using responsive spacing for the first text widget
              Container(
                padding: ResponsiveSpacing.all(16), // Responsive padding
                child: Text(
                  'Hello, World!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
              // Using responsive spacing for the second text widget
              Container(
                padding: ResponsiveSpacing.all(32), // Larger responsive padding
                child: Text(
                  'Welcome to Responsive Spacing!',
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
              // Using responsive spacing for a button
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Action when button is pressed
                },
                child: Container(
                  padding: ResponsiveSpacing.all(12), // Responsive padding for button
                  child: Text('Click Me'),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Responsive Spacing Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, there are three children:
//    - The first Container has responsive padding and displays 'Hello, World!'.
//    - The second Container has larger responsive padding and displays 'Welcome to Responsive Spacing!'.
//    - The third child is an ElevatedButton with responsive padding that triggers an action when pressed.
// 6. The responsive spacing adjusts the padding based on the screen size, ensuring a consistent layout across devices.
