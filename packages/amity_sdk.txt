# Amity SDK Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Amity SDK, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  amity_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/amity_sdk).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Basic Usage
After installation and configuration, you can start using the Amity SDK in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize the SDK and create a user.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:amity_sdk/amity_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Amity SDK Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Amity SDK
    AmityCore.initialize(appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID');
  }

  // Function to create a user
  void createUser() async {
    final user = await AmityUser.createUser(
      userId: 'user123',
      displayName: 'John Doe',
    );
    print('User created: ${user.displayName}');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Amity SDK Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: createUser,
          child: Text('Create User'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the Amity SDK and create a user when the button is pressed. Make sure to replace `'YOUR_APP_ID'` with your actual application ID from the Amity dashboard.

# Complete Example of Amity SDK in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:amity_sdk/amity_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Amity SDK Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Amity SDK with your app ID
    AmityCore.initialize(appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID');
  }

  // Function to create a user
  void createUser() async {
    // Create a new user with a unique user ID and display name
    final user = await AmityUser.createUser(
      userId: 'user123',
      displayName: 'John Doe',
    );
    // Print the created user's display name to the console
    print('User created: ${user.displayName}');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Amity SDK Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: createUser, // Call createUser when button is pressed
          child: Text('Create User'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. In RealFlutter's state, the Amity SDK is initialized in initState() with the app ID.
// 4. When the user presses the "Create User" button, the createUser function is called.
// 5. Inside createUser, a new user is created using the Amity SDK, and the user's display name is printed to the console.
