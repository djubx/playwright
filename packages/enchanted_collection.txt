// The above code creates a simple Flutter app that demonstrates the use of the EnchantedCollection package.
// The app displays the original collection, filtered collection, sorted collection, and grouped collection.
// The collection is created and populated in the initState method.
// The filter, sort, and group methods are used to modify the collection.
// The join method is used to convert the collection to a string for display.

// The app flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and the initState method is called.
// 2. The collection is created and populated with three items.
// 3. The build method is called and the app UI is displayed.
// 4. The user sees the original collection, filtered collection, sorted collection, and grouped collection.
// 5. The user can interact with the app by modifying the collection and seeing the changes reflected in the UI.
