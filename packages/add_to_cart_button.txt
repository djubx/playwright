## Platform-Specific Configuration

No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities. However, the `add_to_cart_button` package does not require any special permissions.

## Using the Package
To use the `add_to_cart_button` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

You can then use the `AddToCartButton` widget in your UI. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
AddToCartButton(
  icon: Icon(Icons.add_shopping_cart),
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle the add to cart action
  },
)
```

This button can be customized with various parameters such as size, color, and animation duration. Refer to the package documentation for more customization options.

# Complete Example of Using the `add_to_cart_button` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:add_to_cart_button/add_to_cart_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Add to Cart Button Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Add to Cart Button Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Product Name',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // AddToCartButton widget
              AddToCartButton(
                icon: Icon(Icons.add_shopping_cart),
                onPressed: () {
                  // This function is called when the button is pressed
                  // Here you can add the logic to add the item to the cart
                  print('Item added to cart!');
                },
                // Customizing the button
                color: Colors.blue,
                size: 50,
                elevation: 5,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Add to Cart Button Demo".
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Column widget.
// 5. Inside the Column, a Text widget displays the product name.
// 6. Below the product name, the AddToCartButton widget is placed.
// 7. When the AddToCartButton is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback, which currently prints a message to the console.
// 8. The button is styled with a blue color, a size of 50, and an elevation of 5 for a shadow effect.
