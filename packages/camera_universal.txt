# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Camera Universal

## Installation
To get started with the `camera_universal` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  camera_universal: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/camera_universal).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request camera permissions:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save photos.</string>
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured the necessary permissions, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a camera preview and capture functionality.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:camera_universal/camera_universal.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  CameraController? _controller; // Controller for the camera
  Future<void>? _initializeControllerFuture; // Future to initialize the controller

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the camera controller
    _initializeCamera();
  }

  Future<void> _initializeCamera() async {
    // Get the list of available cameras
    final cameras = await availableCameras();
    // Select the first camera (usually the back camera)
    final camera = cameras.first;

    // Create a CameraController
    _controller = CameraController(
      camera,
      ResolutionPreset.high, // Set the resolution
    );

    // Initialize the controller
    _initializeControllerFuture = _controller!.initialize();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is disposed
    _controller?.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Camera Universal Example')),
        body: FutureBuilder<void>(
          future: _initializeControllerFuture, // Wait for the controller to initialize
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {
              // If the controller is initialized, display the camera preview
              return CameraPreview(_controller!);
            } else {
              // Otherwise, show a loading indicator
              return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
            }
          },
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            try {
              // Ensure the controller is initialized
              await _initializeControllerFuture;
              // Capture an image and save it to the device
              final image = await _controller!.takePicture();
              // Display the captured image
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                  content: Image.file(File(image.path)), // Show the captured image
                ),
              );
            } catch (e) {
              print(e); // Handle any errors
            }
          },
          child: Icon(Icons.camera),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize the camera controller in initState.
// 3. The _initializeCamera method fetches available cameras and initializes the controller.
// 4. The build method uses a FutureBuilder to wait for the camera controller to initialize.
// 5. Once initialized, the CameraPreview widget displays the camera feed.
// 6. A FloatingActionButton is provided to capture an image when pressed.
// 7. The captured image is displayed in a dialog using an AlertDialog.
