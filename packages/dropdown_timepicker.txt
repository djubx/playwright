# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Dropdown TimePicker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `dropdown_timepicker` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `dropdown_timepicker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dropdown_timepicker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to include permissions for using the device's time settings if required by your app.

## Step 3: Using the Dropdown TimePicker

Now that you have set up the package, you can use the `DropdownTimePicker` widget in your application. Below is an example of how to implement it.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dropdown_timepicker/dropdown_timepicker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dropdown TimePicker Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TimePickerWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class TimePickerWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TimePickerWidgetState createState() => _TimePickerWidgetState();
}

class _TimePickerWidgetState extends State<TimePickerWidget> {
  TimeOfDay selectedTime = TimeOfDay.now(); // Initialize with current time

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text(
          'Selected Time: ${selectedTime.format(context)}',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        DropdownTimePicker(
          initialTime: selectedTime,
          onChanged: (TimeOfDay newTime) {
            setState(() {
              selectedTime = newTime; // Update selected time
            });
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the `DropdownTimePicker` widget to allow users to select a time. The selected time is displayed above the dropdown.

# Complete Example of Dropdown TimePicker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dropdown_timepicker/dropdown_timepicker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dropdown TimePicker Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TimePickerWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class TimePickerWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TimePickerWidgetState createState() => _TimePickerWidgetState();
}

class _TimePickerWidgetState extends State<TimePickerWidget> {
  TimeOfDay selectedTime = TimeOfDay.now(); // Initialize with current time

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the currently selected time
        Text(
          'Selected Time: ${selectedTime.format(context)}',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between text and dropdown
        DropdownTimePicker(
          initialTime: selectedTime, // Set the initial time
          onChanged: (TimeOfDay newTime) {
            setState(() {
              selectedTime = newTime; // Update the selected time when changed
            });
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home of the app is a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered TimePickerWidget.
// 3. The TimePickerWidget is a stateful widget that maintains the selected time.
// 4. The selected time is displayed in a Text widget.
// 5. The DropdownTimePicker widget is used to allow users to select a time.
// 6. When the user selects a new time, the onChanged callback updates the selectedTime state, causing the UI to refresh and display the new time.
