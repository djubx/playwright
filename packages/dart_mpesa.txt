# Setting Up and Using the dart_mpesa Package

## Installation
To get started with the `dart_mpesa` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dart_mpesa: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_mpesa).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following lines to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `dart_mpesa` package, you need to initialize it with your M-Pesa credentials. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:dart_mpesa/dart_mpesa.dart';

void main() {
  final mpesa = RealFlutter(
    consumerKey: 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY',
    consumerSecret: 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET',
    shortcode: 'YOUR_SHORTCODE',
    lipaNaMpesaOnline: 'YOUR_LIPA_NA_MPESA_ONLINE',
  );

  // Now you can use mpesa to initiate payments, check balances, etc.
}
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual M-Pesa credentials.

# Complete Example of Using dart_mpesa

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dart_mpesa/dart_mpesa.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'M-Pesa Payment Demo',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PaymentScreenState createState() => _PaymentScreenState();
}

class _PaymentScreenState extends State<PaymentScreen> {
  final mpesa = RealFlutter(
    consumerKey: 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY',
    consumerSecret: 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET',
    shortcode: 'YOUR_SHORTCODE',
    lipaNaMpesaOnline: 'YOUR_LIPA_NA_MPESA_ONLINE',
  );

  String _responseMessage = '';

  // Function to initiate payment
  void _initiatePayment() async {
    try {
      // Initiating payment
      final response = await mpesa.lipaNaMpesaOnline(
        amount: 1.0, // Amount to be paid
        phoneNumber: 'YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER', // User's phone number
        callbackUrl: 'YOUR_CALLBACK_URL', // Callback URL for M-Pesa
      );

      // Update response message
      setState(() {
        _responseMessage = response.toString();
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors
      setState(() {
        _responseMessage = 'Error: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('M-Pesa Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _initiatePayment,
              child: Text('Pay with M-Pesa'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_responseMessage), // Display response message
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The PaymentScreen widget is displayed, containing a button to initiate payment.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the _initiatePayment function is called.
// 4. This function uses the dart_mpesa package to initiate a payment with the specified amount and phone number.
// 5. The response from the M-Pesa API is captured and displayed on the screen.
// 6. If an error occurs during the payment process, it is caught and displayed as well.
