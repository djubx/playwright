# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using cr_mentions

## Step 1: Adding Dependency

To get started, add the `cr_mentions` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cr_mentions: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. For example, if you are accessing user data, you might need to add:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to contacts for mentions.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

To use the `cr_mentions` package, you will typically create a text input field that supports mentions. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cr_mentions/cr_mentions.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mentions Example')),
        body: MentionsExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MentionsExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MentionsExampleState createState() => _MentionsExampleState();
}

class _MentionsExampleState extends State<MentionsExample> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: MentionsTextField(
        controller: _controller,
        suggestionsCallback: (pattern) {
          // Return a list of suggestions based on the pattern
          return ['@user1', '@user2', '@user3'].where((user) => user.contains(pattern)).toList();
        },
        onMentionSelected: (mention) {
          // Handle the mention selection
          print('Selected mention: $mention');
        },
        decoration: InputDecoration(
          hintText: 'Type a message...',
          border: OutlineInputBorder(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a text field that supports mentions. The `suggestionsCallback` provides a list of user suggestions based on the input pattern.

## Conclusion

With the `cr_mentions` package, you can easily add mention functionality to your Flutter applications. The setup is straightforward, and the package is flexible enough to meet various use cases.

# Complete Example of cr_mentions

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cr_mentions/cr_mentions.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mentions Example')),
        body: MentionsExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MentionsExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MentionsExampleState createState() => _MentionsExampleState();
}

class _MentionsExampleState extends State<MentionsExample> {
  // Controller for the text field
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: MentionsTextField(
        controller: _controller,
        // Callback to provide suggestions based on user input
        suggestionsCallback: (pattern) {
          // Return a list of suggestions based on the pattern
          return ['@user1', '@user2', '@user3'].where((user) => user.contains(pattern)).toList();
        },
        // Callback when a mention is selected
        onMentionSelected: (mention) {
          // Handle the mention selection
          print('Selected mention: $mention');
        },
        decoration: InputDecoration(
          hintText: 'Type a message...',
          border: OutlineInputBorder(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp and the main scaffold.
// 2. The MentionsExample widget is created, which contains a stateful widget to manage the text input.
// 3. A TextEditingController is initialized to control the text field.
// 4. The MentionsTextField widget is used to create a text input that supports mentions.
// 5. The suggestionsCallback provides a list of user suggestions based on the input pattern.
// 6. When a user selects a mention, the onMentionSelected callback is triggered, allowing you to handle the mention selection.
```

In summary, the `cr_mentions` package provides a robust solution for implementing mention functionality in Flutter applications. The example above demonstrates how to set up the package, create a text field with mention capabilities, and handle user interactions effectively. By following the steps outlined in this blog, you can easily integrate mentions into your own Flutter projects.
