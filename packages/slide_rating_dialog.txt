# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Slide Rating Dialog

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `slide_rating_dialog` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  slide_rating_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:slide_rating_dialog/slide_rating_dialog.dart';
```

## Step 3: Implementing the Dialog
You can implement the dialog in your Flutter application by calling it from a button or any other widget. Below are platform-specific details for Android and iOS.

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Dialog
You can trigger the dialog using the following code snippet:

```dart
void _showRatingDialog(BuildContext context) {
  showDialog(
    context: context,
    builder: (BuildContext context) {
      return SlideRatingDialog(
        title: 'Rate Your Experience',
        description: 'Please rate your experience with our service.',
        onSubmit: (rating) {
          // Handle the rating submission
          print('User rating: $rating');
        },
      );
    },
  );
}
```

## Step 5: Triggering the Dialog
You can call `_showRatingDialog(context)` from a button's `onPressed` method to display the dialog.

With these steps, you can successfully integrate the `slide_rating_dialog` package into your Flutter application, allowing users to provide ratings easily.

# Complete Example of Slide Rating Dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:slide_rating_dialog/slide_rating_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Slide Rating Dialog Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Slide Rating Dialog Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the rating dialog when the button is pressed
              _showRatingDialog(context);
            },
            child: Text('Rate Us'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _showRatingDialog(BuildContext context) {
    // Show the slide rating dialog
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
        return SlideRatingDialog(
          title: 'Rate Your Experience',
          description: 'Please rate your experience with our service.',
          onSubmit: (rating) {
            // Handle the rating submission
            print('User rating: $rating');
          },
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _showRatingDialog method is called.
// 5. This method displays the SlideRatingDialog, allowing the user to select a rating.
// 6. Upon submission, the selected rating is printed to the console.
