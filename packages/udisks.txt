# Overview of the "udisks" Flutter Package

The "udisks" package is a powerful Flutter plugin designed to facilitate disk management operations on both Android and iOS platforms. It provides developers with the ability to interact with disk drives, manage storage, and perform various file operations seamlessly. This package is particularly useful for applications that require file management capabilities, such as file explorers, backup solutions, or any app that needs to handle large amounts of data.

## Key Features
- **Disk Information**: Retrieve detailed information about connected disks, including capacity, available space, and file system type.
- **File Operations**: Perform operations such as reading, writing, and deleting files on the disk.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilizes Dart's async/await features for non-blocking operations, enhancing performance.

## When to Use
Consider using the "udisks" package when:
- You need to build a file management application.
- Your app requires access to external storage devices.
- You want to provide users with the ability to manage files and directories on their devices.

Overall, the "udisks" package is an essential tool for Flutter developers looking to implement robust disk management features in their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "udisks" Package

## Installation
To get started with the "udisks" package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  udisks: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/udisks).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/`.
2. Add the following permissions to allow access to external storage:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/`.
2. Add the following key to request permission for accessing files:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library.</string>
<key>NSDocumentsDirectoryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your documents directory.</string>
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured the necessary permissions, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve disk information and perform file operations.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:udisks/udisks.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  DiskInfo? diskInfo;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getDiskInfo();
  }

  Future<void> _getDiskInfo() async {
    // Fetch disk information asynchronously
    diskInfo = await Udisks.getDiskInfo();
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI with the fetched disk info
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Udisks Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: diskInfo == null
            ? CircularProgressIndicator() // Show loading indicator while fetching data
            : Text('Disk Capacity: ${diskInfo!.capacity} bytes'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that retrieves and displays disk information. The `Udisks.getDiskInfo()` method is called to fetch the disk details, which are then displayed in the UI.

# Complete Example of Using the "udisks" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:udisks/udisks.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  DiskInfo? diskInfo; // Variable to hold disk information

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getDiskInfo(); // Call method to fetch disk information on initialization
  }

  Future<void> _getDiskInfo() async {
    // Fetch disk information asynchronously
    diskInfo = await Udisks.getDiskInfo();
    setState(() {}); // Update the UI with the fetched disk info
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Udisks Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: diskInfo == null
            ? CircularProgressIndicator() // Show loading indicator while fetching data
            : Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                children: [
                  Text('Disk Capacity: ${diskInfo!.capacity} bytes'), // Display disk capacity
                  Text('Available Space: ${diskInfo!.availableSpace} bytes'), // Display available space
                  Text('File System: ${diskInfo!.fileSystem}'), // Display file system type
                ],
              ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we define a stateful widget to manage the disk information.
// 3. The _getDiskInfo method is called in initState to fetch disk information when the widget is initialized.
// 4. The disk information is retrieved asynchronously using Udisks.getDiskInfo().
// 5. Once the data is fetched, setState is called to update the UI.
// 6. The build method displays a loading indicator while the data is being fetched.
// 7. After fetching, it displays the disk capacity, available space, and file system type in a column layout.
