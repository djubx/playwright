# Tutorial: Setting Up Pay with Paystack in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **pay_with_paystack** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **pay_with_paystack** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pay_with_paystack: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure Android

For Android, you need to ensure that your app has the necessary permissions and configurations:

1. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Configure iOS

For iOS, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following entries to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

3. Ensure that your deployment target is set to at least iOS 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Initialize Paystack

In your Flutter application, you need to initialize Paystack with your public key. You can obtain this key from your Paystack dashboard.

```dart
import 'package:pay_with_paystack/pay_with_paystack.dart';

void main() {
  PaystackPlugin.initialize(publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY');
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 5: Implement Payment

You can now implement the payment functionality in your app. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate a payment:

```dart
void initiatePayment() async {
  var response = await PaystackPlugin.checkout(
    context,
    method: CheckoutMethod.card,
    publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
    amount: 10000, // Amount in kobo
    email: 'customer@example.com',
  );

  if (response.status) {
    // Payment was successful
    print('Payment successful: ${response.reference}');
  } else {
    // Payment failed
    print('Payment failed: ${response.message}');
  }
}
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up the **pay_with_paystack** package in your Flutter application. You can now handle payments securely and efficiently.

# Complete Example of Pay with Paystack

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pay_with_paystack/pay_with_paystack.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Paystack with your public key
  PaystackPlugin.initialize(publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY');
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Paystack Payment Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Paystack Payment'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Call the function to initiate payment
            initiatePayment(context);
          },
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void initiatePayment(BuildContext context) async {
    // Start the payment process
    var response = await PaystackPlugin.checkout(
      context,
      method: CheckoutMethod.card,
      publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
      amount: 10000, // Amount in kobo
      email: 'customer@example.com',
    );

    // Check the response status
    if (response.status) {
      // Payment was successful
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Payment successful: ${response.reference}')),
      );
    } else {
      // Payment failed
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text('Payment failed: ${response.message}')),
      );
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts by initializing the Paystack plugin with the public key.
// 2. The main widget is a MaterialApp that contains a PaymentScreen.
// 3. The PaymentScreen displays a button labeled "Pay Now".
// 4. When the button is pressed, the initiatePayment function is called.
// 5. The initiatePayment function triggers the Paystack checkout process.
// 6. If the payment is successful, a success message is displayed; otherwise, a failure message is shown.
```
