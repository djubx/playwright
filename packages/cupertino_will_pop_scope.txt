# Cupertino Will Pop Scope: A Comprehensive Overview

The `cupertino_will_pop_scope` package is a Flutter package designed to enhance the user experience by providing a customizable way to handle the back navigation behavior in iOS-style applications. This package allows developers to intercept the back navigation action and present a confirmation dialog or perform any other action before the user leaves the current screen.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using `cupertino_will_pop_scope` in scenarios where:
- You want to prevent users from accidentally navigating away from a screen, such as during form submissions or while editing important data.
- You need to confirm user actions before they leave a particular screen, enhancing the overall user experience.
- You are developing an iOS-style application and want to maintain consistency with the platform's design guidelines.

## Features

- **Customizable Back Navigation Handling**: Intercept back navigation and provide custom behavior.
- **iOS Style Dialogs**: Use Cupertino-style dialogs for a native look and feel.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications.

By leveraging this package, developers can create a more controlled and user-friendly navigation experience in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Cupertino Will Pop Scope

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `cupertino_will_pop_scope` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `cupertino_will_pop_scope` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_will_pop_scope: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Basic Usage

To use the `cupertino_will_pop_scope`, wrap your widget tree with `CupertinoWillPopScope`. You need to provide a callback function that returns a `Future<bool>` indicating whether the pop action should be allowed.

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement `CupertinoWillPopScope`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cupertino_will_pop_scope/cupertino_will_pop_scope.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CupertinoApp(
      home: CupertinoWillPopScope(
        onWillPop: () async {
          // Show a confirmation dialog before popping
          return await showCupertinoDialog(
            context: context,
            builder: (context) {
              return CupertinoAlertDialog(
                title: Text('Confirm Exit'),
                content: Text('Are you sure you want to leave this page?'),
                actions: [
                  CupertinoDialogAction(
                    child: Text('Cancel'),
                    onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(false),
                  ),
                  CupertinoDialogAction(
                    child: Text('Yes'),
                    onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(true),
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
          );
        },
        child: CupertinoPageScaffold(
          navigationBar: CupertinoNavigationBar(
            middle: Text('Home Page'),
          ),
          child: Center(
            child: Text('Press back to see the dialog!'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### iOS

On iOS, the `cupertino_will_pop_scope` package will seamlessly integrate with the existing Cupertino widgets, providing a native look and feel. Ensure that your app is set up to use the Cupertino design language.

### Android

While the package is primarily designed for iOS-style applications, it can also be used in Android applications. However, keep in mind that the dialog style will differ from the Material design guidelines.

## Step 3: Testing the Application

Run your application on an iOS simulator or device. When you press the back button, a confirmation dialog will appear, allowing you to confirm whether you want to leave the page.

By following these steps, you can effectively implement the `cupertino_will_pop_scope` package in your Flutter application, enhancing the user experience with controlled navigation.

# Complete Example of Cupertino Will Pop Scope

```dart
import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cupertino_will_pop_scope/cupertino_will_pop_scope.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CupertinoApp(
      home: CupertinoWillPopScope(
        onWillPop: () async {
          // Show a confirmation dialog before allowing the pop action
          return await showCupertinoDialog(
            context: context,
            builder: (context) {
              return CupertinoAlertDialog(
                title: Text('Confirm Exit'),
                content: Text('Are you sure you want to leave this page?'),
                actions: [
                  CupertinoDialogAction(
                    child: Text('Cancel'),
                    onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(false), // Cancel action
                  ),
                  CupertinoDialogAction(
                    child: Text('Yes'),
                    onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(true), // Confirm action
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
          );
        },
        child: CupertinoPageScaffold(
          navigationBar: CupertinoNavigationBar(
            middle: Text('Home Page'), // Title of the page
          ),
          child: Center(
            child: Text('Press back to see the dialog!'), // Main content
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a CupertinoApp with a CupertinoWillPopScope.
// 3. The onWillPop callback is defined to show a confirmation dialog when the back button is pressed.
// 4. If the user selects 'Cancel', the dialog closes and the user remains on the page.
// 5. If the user selects 'Yes', the dialog closes and the page is popped from the navigation stack.
// 6. The main content of the page is a simple text widget prompting the user to press back.
