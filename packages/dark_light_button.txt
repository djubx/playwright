```ruby

```

## Using the Package
To use the dark_light_button in your Flutter application, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:dark_light_button/dark_light_button.dart';
   ```

2. Create a StatefulWidget to manage the theme state:
   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
   }

   class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
     bool isDarkMode = false; // Initial theme state

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return MaterialApp(
         theme: isDarkMode ? ThemeData.dark() : ThemeData.light(),
         home: Scaffold(
           appBar: AppBar(
             title: Text('Dark Light Button Example'),
           ),
           body: Center(
             child: DarkLightButton(
               isDarkMode: isDarkMode,
               onChanged: (value) {
                 setState(() {
                   isDarkMode = value; // Update theme state
                 });
               },
             ),
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

3. Run your application to see the dark/light toggle button in action!

# Complete Example of Dark Light Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dark_light_button/dark_light_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the application with RealFlutter widget
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool isDarkMode = false; // Variable to track the current theme state

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      theme: isDarkMode ? ThemeData.dark() : ThemeData.light(), // Set theme based on isDarkMode
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dark Light Button Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DarkLightButton(
            isDarkMode: isDarkMode, // Pass the current theme state
            onChanged: (value) {
              setState(() {
                isDarkMode = value; // Update the theme state when button is toggled
              });
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the theme (dark/light).
// 3. The build method returns a MaterialApp with a theme based on the isDarkMode variable.
// 4. The DarkLightButton widget is placed in the center of the screen.
// 5. When the button is toggled, the onChanged callback updates the isDarkMode variable.
// 6. The setState method triggers a rebuild of the widget, applying the new theme.
```
