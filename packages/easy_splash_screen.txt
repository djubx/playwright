# Tutorial: Setting Up Easy Splash Screen

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **easy_splash_screen** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **easy_splash_screen** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_splash_screen: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:easy_splash_screen/easy_splash_screen.dart';
```

## Step 3: Configure Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations. Typically, no additional configurations are required for the splash screen itself, but ensure your app's theme is set correctly.

```xml
<application
    android:label="Your App Name"
    android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
    <activity
        android:name=".MainActivity"
        android:theme="@style/LaunchTheme">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
        </intent-filter>
    </activity>
</application>
```

## Step 4: Configure iOS

For iOS, you may want to customize the launch screen by editing the `LaunchScreen.storyboard` file in Xcode. This is optional but can enhance the user experience.

## Step 5: Implement the Splash Screen

Now, let's implement the splash screen in your main application file. Below is an example of how to use the **easy_splash_screen** package.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_splash_screen/easy_splash_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Splash Screen Demo',
      home: EasySplashScreen(
        logo: Image.asset('assets/logo.png'), // Your logo image
        title: Text(
          'Welcome to RealFlutter',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
        ),
        backgroundColor: Colors.blue, // Background color of the splash screen
        duration: 3000, // Duration of the splash screen in milliseconds
        navigator: HomeScreen(), // Navigate to HomeScreen after splash
        showLoader: true, // Show a loading indicator
        loaderColor: Colors.white, // Loader color
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('This is the home screen!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home property.
// 3. The EasySplashScreen widget is used as the home screen, displaying a logo, title, and background color.
// 4. The splash screen is displayed for 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds) before navigating to the HomeScreen.
// 5. The HomeScreen widget is a simple scaffold with an AppBar and a centered text message.
// 6. The loader is displayed during the splash screen duration, enhancing the user experience.
