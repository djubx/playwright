# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_fast_forms`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `flutter_fast_forms`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_fast_forms: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a form using `flutter_fast_forms`.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_fast_forms/flutter_fast_forms.dart';
```

2. Create a form using the `RealFlutter` class:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fast Forms Example')),
      body: FastForm(
        onSubmit: (formData) {
          // Handle form submission
          print(formData);
        },
        children: [
          FastTextField(
            label: 'Name',
            validator: (value) {
              if (value.isEmpty) {
                return 'Please enter your name';
              }
              return null;
            },
          ),
          FastTextField(
            label: 'Email',
            validator: (value) {
              if (!RegExp(r'^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+').hasMatch(value)) {
                return 'Please enter a valid email';
              }
              return null;
            },
          ),
          FastSubmitButton(label: 'Submit'),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic form with two fields: Name and Email, along with a submit button. The form validates the input and prints the data upon submission.

# Complete Example of `flutter_fast_forms`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_fast_forms/flutter_fast_forms.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Fast Forms Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Fast Forms Example')),
      body: FastForm(
        onSubmit: (formData) {
          // Handle form submission
          print(formData); // Print the submitted form data to the console
        },
        children: [
          FastTextField(
            label: 'Name',
            validator: (value) {
              // Validate that the name field is not empty
              if (value.isEmpty) {
                return 'Please enter your name'; // Return error message if empty
              }
              return null; // Return null if validation passes
            },
          ),
          FastTextField(
            label: 'Email',
            validator: (value) {
              // Validate that the email field contains a valid email format
              if (!RegExp(r'^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+').hasMatch(value)) {
                return 'Please enter a valid email'; // Return error message if invalid
              }
              return null; // Return null if validation passes
            },
          ),
          FastSubmitButton(label: 'Submit'), // Submit button for the form
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a FastForm widget.
// 4. The FastForm widget contains two FastTextField widgets for Name and Email, each with validation logic.
// 5. When the user submits the form, the onSubmit callback is triggered, printing the form data to the console.
// 6. If validation fails, an error message is displayed below the respective field, guiding the user to correct their input.
```
