# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Touchable Opacity

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `touchable_opacity` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  touchable_opacity: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using Touchable Opacity

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:touchable_opacity/touchable_opacity.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Touchable Opacity Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: TouchableOpacity(
            onTap: () {
              // Action to perform on tap
              print('Button tapped!');
            },
            child: Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Text(
                'Tap Me!',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a button that changes opacity when tapped. The `TouchableOpacity` widget wraps around a `Container`, providing the touch feedback.

# Complete Example of Touchable Opacity

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:touchable_opacity/touchable_opacity.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Touchable Opacity Example')),
        body: Center(
          // Using TouchableOpacity to wrap a Container
          child: TouchableOpacity(
            onTap: () {
              // Action to perform on tap
              print('Button tapped!'); // Log message on tap
            },
            // Customizing the child widget
            child: Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(20), // Padding around the text
              color: Colors.blue, // Background color of the button
              child: Text(
                'Tap Me!', // Text displayed on the button
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20), // Text style
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
3. Inside the Center widget, a TouchableOpacity widget is used to wrap a Container.
4. The Container has padding, a blue background, and contains a Text widget that says "Tap Me!".
5. When the user taps the button, the onTap callback is triggered, printing "Button tapped!" to the console.
6. The TouchableOpacity widget provides visual feedback by changing the opacity of the Container when pressed, enhancing the user experience.
