# esptouch_flutter Package Overview

The `esptouch_flutter` package is a Flutter plugin designed to facilitate the connection of Flutter applications to ESP8266 and ESP32 devices using the ESP-Touch protocol. This package is particularly useful for developers working on IoT applications, allowing seamless integration of smart devices with mobile applications.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `esptouch_flutter` package when:
- You are developing a mobile application that needs to connect to ESP8266 or ESP32 devices.
- You want to simplify the process of device discovery and connection.
- You need a reliable method for configuring Wi-Fi settings on IoT devices.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: The package provides a straightforward API for connecting to ESP devices.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Offers callbacks to inform the user about the connection status.
- **Wi-Fi Configuration**: Allows users to configure Wi-Fi settings for ESP devices directly from the app.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using esptouch_flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `esptouch_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `esptouch_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  esptouch_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/esptouch_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for location services:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to connect to Wi-Fi devices.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to connect to Wi-Fi devices.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to use the `esptouch_flutter` package to connect to an ESP device.

# Complete Example of esptouch_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:esptouch_flutter/esptouch_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _status = "Disconnected"; // Variable to hold connection status
  String _deviceIp = ""; // Variable to hold the device IP address

  // Method to start the ESP-Touch process
  void _startEspTouch(String ssid, String password) async {
    setState(() {
      _status = "Connecting..."; // Update status to connecting
    });

    // Start the ESP-Touch process
    EspTouchResult result = await EspTouch.startEspTouch(ssid, password);

    // Check the result of the connection attempt
    if (result.isSuccess) {
      setState(() {
        _status = "Connected"; // Update status to connected
        _deviceIp = result.ip; // Store the device IP address
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _status = "Connection Failed"; // Update status to failed
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text("ESP-Touch Flutter Example"),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text("Status: $_status"), // Display connection status
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text("Device IP: $_deviceIp"), // Display device IP address
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Start the ESP-Touch process with example credentials
                  _startEspTouch("Your_SSID", "Your_Password");
                },
                child: Text("Connect to Device"), // Button to initiate connection
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application that connects to an ESP device using the esptouch_flutter package.
// 
// 1. **Imports**: We import the necessary packages, including `flutter/material.dart` for UI components and `esptouch_flutter` for the ESP-Touch functionality.
// 
// 2. **Main Function**: The `main` function runs the app by calling `runApp` with the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 
// 3. **Stateful Widget**: `RealFlutter` is a stateful widget that maintains the connection status and device IP address.
// 
// 4. **_startEspTouch Method**: This method initiates the ESP-Touch process. It updates the status to "Connecting..." and calls `EspTouch.startEspTouch` with the provided SSID and password. Depending on the result, it updates the status and device IP address.
// 
// 5. **Build Method**: The `build` method constructs the UI, displaying the connection status and device IP address. It includes a button that triggers the `_startEspTouch` method with example credentials when pressed.
// 
// This simple application allows users to connect to an ESP device and displays the connection status and device IP address.
