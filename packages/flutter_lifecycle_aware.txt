# Flutter Lifecycle Aware Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_lifecycle_aware` package is designed to help Flutter developers manage the lifecycle of their applications more effectively. It provides a way to listen to lifecycle events and respond accordingly, which is particularly useful for managing resources, saving state, and optimizing performance.

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using `flutter_lifecycle_aware` in scenarios such as:
- Managing resources that need to be released when the app goes into the background.
- Saving user data or state when the app is paused.
- Performing specific actions when the app is resumed or started.

## Key Features
- **Lifecycle Event Listeners**: Easily listen to app lifecycle events such as `onResume`, `onPause`, and `onDestroy`.
- **State Management**: Integrates well with state management solutions to maintain app state across lifecycle changes.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

This package is particularly beneficial for applications that require precise control over their lifecycle, ensuring that resources are managed efficiently and user experience is optimized.

# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Lifecycle Aware Package

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_lifecycle_aware` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lifecycle_aware: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lifecycle_aware).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations. Typically, no additional configurations are required for lifecycle management.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your app's Info.plist file is configured correctly. Again, no specific configurations are needed for lifecycle management.

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_lifecycle_aware` package, you will need to create a class that extends `LifecycleAware`. This class will allow you to override lifecycle methods and implement your logic.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a lifecycle-aware widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_lifecycle_aware/flutter_lifecycle_aware.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> with LifecycleAware {
  @override
  void onResume() {
    super.onResume();
    // Code to execute when the app resumes
    print("App Resumed");
  }

  @override
  void onPause() {
    super.onPause();
    // Code to execute when the app is paused
    print("App Paused");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Lifecycle Aware Example")),
      body: Center(child: Text("Observe the console for lifecycle events.")),
    );
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to listen for lifecycle events in a simple Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using the Flutter Lifecycle Aware Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_lifecycle_aware/flutter_lifecycle_aware.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> with LifecycleAware {
  @override
  void onResume() {
    super.onResume();
    // This method is called when the app is resumed
    print("App Resumed");
  }

  @override
  void onPause() {
    super.onPause();
    // This method is called when the app is paused
    print("App Paused");
  }

  @override
  void onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy();
    // This method is called when the app is destroyed
    print("App Destroyed");
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Lifecycle Aware Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: Text("Observe the console for lifecycle events."),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. The _RealFlutterState class extends LifecycleAware, allowing it to listen to lifecycle events.
// 4. When the app is resumed, the onResume() method is triggered, printing "App Resumed" to the console.
// 5. When the app is paused, the onPause() method is triggered, printing "App Paused" to the console.
// 6. If the app is destroyed, the onDestroy() method is triggered, printing "App Destroyed" to the console.
// 7. The UI consists of a simple Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered Text widget that instructs the user to observe the console for lifecycle events.
