# Overview of the `catalyst_cardano_serialization` Flutter Package

The `catalyst_cardano_serialization` package is a powerful tool designed for developers working with the Cardano blockchain within Flutter applications. This package provides serialization and deserialization capabilities for Cardano data structures, making it easier to interact with the Cardano ecosystem.

## When to Use This Package
You should consider using the `catalyst_cardano_serialization` package when:
- You are developing a Flutter application that requires interaction with the Cardano blockchain.
- You need to serialize and deserialize Cardano-specific data types, such as transactions, addresses, and tokens.
- You want to leverage Cardano's features in a user-friendly Flutter interface.

## Key Features
- **Serialization and Deserialization**: Easily convert Cardano data structures to and from JSON.
- **Support for Cardano Types**: Includes support for various Cardano types, such as addresses, transactions, and more.
- **Integration with Flutter**: Seamlessly integrates with Flutter applications, allowing for smooth user experiences.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on both Android and iOS, ensuring a wide reach for your applications.

This package is essential for developers looking to build applications that interact with the Cardano blockchain, providing the necessary tools to handle Cardano data effectively.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `catalyst_cardano_serialization`

## Installation
To get started with the `catalyst_cardano_serialization` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  catalyst_cardano_serialization: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/catalyst_cardano_serialization).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Podfile` and ensure that the platform is set to at least 10.0:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to serialize and deserialize a Cardano address.

```dart
import 'package:catalyst_cardano_serialization/catalyst_cardano_serialization.dart';

void main() {
  // Create a Cardano address
  final address = CardanoAddress.fromBech32('addr1q...');

  // Serialize the address to JSON
  final json = address.toJson();
  print('Serialized Address: $json');

  // Deserialize the JSON back to a Cardano address
  final deserializedAddress = CardanoAddress.fromJson(json);
  print('Deserialized Address: ${deserializedAddress.toBech32()}');
}
```

This example demonstrates the basic serialization and deserialization process using the `catalyst_cardano_serialization` package. You can expand upon this by integrating it into your application logic as needed.

# Complete Example of Using `catalyst_cardano_serialization`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:catalyst_cardano_serialization/catalyst_cardano_serialization.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cardano Serialization Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Cardano Serialization Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CardanoExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CardanoExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CardanoExampleState createState() => _CardanoExampleState();
}

class _CardanoExampleState extends State<CardanoExample> {
  String _serializedAddress = '';
  String _deserializedAddress = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _serializeAndDeserializeAddress();
  }

  void _serializeAndDeserializeAddress() {
    // Create a Cardano address from a Bech32 string
    final address = CardanoAddress.fromBech32('addr1q...');

    // Serialize the address to JSON
    final json = address.toJson();
    setState(() {
      _serializedAddress = json.toString();
    });

    // Deserialize the JSON back to a Cardano address
    final deserializedAddress = CardanoAddress.fromJson(json);
    setState(() {
      _deserializedAddress = deserializedAddress.toBech32();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Serialized Address: $_serializedAddress'),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        Text('Deserialized Address: $_deserializedAddress'),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the CardanoExample widget.
// 4. CardanoExample is a StatefulWidget that initializes its state in initState.
// 5. In _serializeAndDeserializeAddress, a Cardano address is created from a Bech32 string.
// 6. The address is serialized to JSON, and the serialized string is displayed on the screen.
// 7. The JSON is then deserialized back into a Cardano address, and the result is also displayed.
// 8. The UI updates to show both the serialized and deserialized addresses.
