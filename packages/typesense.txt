# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Typesense Flutter Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the Typesense Flutter package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  typesense: ^0.1.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configuring Typesense

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that you have internet permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following lines to allow network access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Typesense Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initialize and use Typesense.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:typesense/typesense.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  final TypesenseClient client;

  RealFlutter() : client = TypesenseClient(
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    nodes: [
      Node(host: 'YOUR_TYPESENSE_HOST', port: 443, protocol: 'https'),
    ],
  );

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Typesense Flutter Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Perform a search query
              final response = await client.collections['your_collection'].documents.search(
                SearchParameters(q: 'search term', queryBy: 'field_name'),
              );
              print(response);
            },
            child: Text('Search'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **TypesenseClient Initialization**: The `TypesenseClient` is initialized with your API key and the node details of your Typesense server.
- **Search Button**: When the button is pressed, a search query is executed against the specified collection and field.
- **Response Handling**: The search results are printed to the console.

# Complete Example of a Flutter Application Using Typesense

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:typesense/typesense.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Initialize the Typesense client with your API key and node details
  final TypesenseClient client;

  RealFlutter() : client = TypesenseClient(
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY', // Replace with your actual API key
    nodes: [
      Node(host: 'YOUR_TYPESENSE_HOST', port: 443, protocol: 'https'), // Replace with your Typesense host
    ],
  );

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Typesense Flutter Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Perform a search query when the button is pressed
              final response = await client.collections['your_collection'].documents.search(
                SearchParameters(q: 'search term', queryBy: 'field_name'), // Replace with your search term and field
              );
              // Print the search results to the console
              print(response);
            },
            child: Text('Search'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The Typesense client is initialized with the API key and node details.
// 3. The main screen displays a button labeled 'Search'.
// 4. When the button is pressed, a search query is executed against the specified Typesense collection.
// 5. The search results are printed to the console for debugging or further processing.
