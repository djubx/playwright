# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Dynamic Carousel

## Installation
To use the `dynamic_carousel` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dynamic_carousel: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package. After saving the file, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `dynamic_carousel` package, you can create a simple carousel widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dynamic_carousel/dynamic_carousel.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dynamic Carousel Example')),
      body: DynamicCarousel(
        items: [
          Image.network('https://example.com/image1.jpg'),
          Image.network('https://example.com/image2.jpg'),
          Image.network('https://example.com/image3.jpg'),
        ],
        options: CarouselOptions(
          autoPlay: true,
          height: 200,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple `DynamicCarousel` widget that displays three images. The `autoPlay` option allows the carousel to automatically transition between items.

With this setup, you can easily create a dynamic carousel in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Dynamic Carousel

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dynamic_carousel/dynamic_carousel.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dynamic Carousel Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dynamic Carousel Example')),
      body: DynamicCarousel(
        items: [
          // Adding images to the carousel
          Image.network('https://example.com/image1.jpg'), // First image
          Image.network('https://example.com/image2.jpg'), // Second image
          Image.network('https://example.com/image3.jpg'), // Third image
        ],
        options: CarouselOptions(
          autoPlay: true, // Enables automatic sliding of images
          height: 200, // Sets the height of the carousel
          enlargeCenterPage: true, // Enlarges the center item
          aspectRatio: 16 / 9, // Sets the aspect ratio of the carousel
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a DynamicCarousel in the body.
// 4. The DynamicCarousel takes a list of images and displays them in a carousel format.
// 5. The carousel is configured to auto-play, has a specified height, and enlarges the center item for better visibility.
// 6. Users can swipe through the images, and the carousel will automatically transition between them.
