### Tutorial

#### Installation

To get started with `flutter_aliplayer`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_aliplayer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_aliplayer).

#### Platform-Specific Configuration

**For Android:**
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.
2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

**For iOS:**
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0.

#### Basic Usage

To use the `flutter_aliplayer` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_aliplayer/flutter_aliplayer.dart';
```

You can then create a simple video player widget as follows:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late AliPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = AliPlayerController();
    _controller.setDataSource("https://example.com/video.mp4");
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Video Player")),
      body: Center(
        child: AliPlayer(controller: _controller),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_aliplayer/flutter_aliplayer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Declare the AliPlayerController to manage video playback
  late AliPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the controller and set the video source
    _controller = AliPlayerController();
    _controller.setDataSource("https://example.com/video.mp4");
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controller when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Video Player")),
      body: Center(
        // Use the AliPlayer widget to display the video
        child: AliPlayer(controller: _controller),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. In the initState method, we initialize the AliPlayerController and set the video source.
// 3. The build method returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing the AliPlayer.
// 4. When the widget is disposed, we ensure to clean up the controller to prevent memory leaks.
```
