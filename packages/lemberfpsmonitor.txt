Here's a detailed technical blog on the "lemberfpsmonitor" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# LemberFPSMonitor Flutter Package

The **LemberFPSMonitor** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers who want to monitor the frames per second (FPS) of their applications in real-time. This package is particularly useful for performance optimization, allowing developers to identify bottlenecks and ensure smooth animations and transitions.

## When to Use LemberFPSMonitor

- **Performance Monitoring**: Use this package when you need to track the performance of your Flutter application, especially during development and testing phases.
- **Game Development**: Ideal for game developers who need to maintain a high FPS for a smooth gaming experience.
- **Animation-heavy Applications**: If your app relies heavily on animations, this package can help you ensure that they run smoothly without dropping frames.

## Features

- **Real-time FPS Monitoring**: Displays the current FPS in real-time, allowing developers to see how their changes affect performance.
- **Customizable Display**: You can customize the appearance of the FPS display to fit your app's design.
- **Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, LemberFPSMonitor is an essential tool for any Flutter developer looking to enhance their application's performance.

# Tutorial: Setting Up LemberFPSMonitor

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the LemberFPSMonitor package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the LemberFPSMonitor package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  lemberfpsmonitor: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/lemberfpsmonitor).

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:lemberfpsmonitor/lemberfpsmonitor.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Typically, no special permissions are required for FPS monitoring, but ensure your app's minimum SDK version is compatible with the package.

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to adjust your `Info.plist` file if you are using any specific features that require permissions. However, FPS monitoring does not require additional configurations.

## Step 4: Using LemberFPSMonitor

To use the LemberFPSMonitor in your application, wrap your main widget with the `LemberFPSMonitor` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
LemberFPSMonitor(
  child: MyApp(),
)
```

This will display the FPS overlay on top of your application.

## Step 5: Customizing the Display

You can customize the appearance of the FPS display by passing parameters to the `LemberFPSMonitor` widget. For example:

```dart
LemberFPSMonitor(
  textStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.red, fontSize: 20),
  child: MyApp(),
)
```

This will change the color and size of the FPS text.

With these steps, you are now ready to monitor the FPS of your Flutter application using the LemberFPSMonitor package!

# Complete Example of LemberFPSMonitor

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lemberfpsmonitor/lemberfpsmonitor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'LemberFPSMonitor Example',
      home: FPSMonitorHome(),
    );
  }
}

class FPSMonitorHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FPSMonitorHomeState createState() => _FPSMonitorHomeState();
}

class _FPSMonitorHomeState extends State<FPSMonitorHome> {
  // A simple counter to simulate workload
  int _counter = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LemberFPSMonitor(
      textStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.red, fontSize: 20), // Customizing the FPS display
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('LemberFPSMonitor Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'You have pushed the button this many times:',
              ),
              Text(
                '$_counter',
                style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: _incrementCounter,
          tooltip: 'Increment',
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _incrementCounter() {
    // Increment the counter and set state to rebuild the UI
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (FPSMonitorHome).
// 3. FPSMonitorHome is a StatefulWidget that maintains a counter.
// 4. The build method of _FPSMonitorHomeState wraps the Scaffold in LemberFPSMonitor.
// 5. The Scaffold contains an AppBar, a Center widget with a Column displaying the counter, and a FloatingActionButton.
// 6. When the button is pressed, _incrementCounter is called, which updates the counter and triggers a UI rebuild.
// 7. The FPSMonitor displays the current frames per second in real-time, helping to monitor performance.
```
