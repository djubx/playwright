Here's a detailed technical blog on the "cli_pkg" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Description

The `cli_pkg` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to simplify command-line interface (CLI) interactions within Flutter applications. It provides a straightforward way to execute shell commands, manage processes, and handle input/output streams, making it ideal for applications that require backend processing or integration with system-level commands.

## When to Use `cli_pkg`

You might consider using `cli_pkg` in scenarios such as:
- **Building CLI Tools**: If you're developing a Flutter application that needs to execute shell commands or scripts.
- **Integrating with System Commands**: For applications that require interaction with the operating system, such as file management or network operations.
- **Automating Tasks**: When you need to automate repetitive tasks through command-line operations.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Process Management**: Easily manage and control processes, including starting, stopping, and monitoring.
- **Stream Handling**: Capture and manipulate standard input/output streams.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for command execution failures.

## Setup Process

To get started with the `cli_pkg`, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `cli_pkg` dependency.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     cli_pkg: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` has the necessary permissions if you are executing commands that require them. For example, if you need to access the internet or external storage, add:

     ```xml
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
     ```

   - **iOS**: For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow certain operations. For example, if your app needs to access files, you might need to add:

     ```xml
     <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
     <string>This app requires access to the photo library.</string>
     ```

## Using the Package

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `cli_pkg` in your Flutter application:

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:cli_pkg/cli_pkg.dart';
   ```

2. **Create a Function to Execute Commands**:

   ```dart
   Future<void> runCommand(String command) async {
     final result = await CLI.run(command);
     print('Command Output: ${result.stdout}');
     print('Command Error: ${result.stderr}');
   }
   ```

3. **Call the Function**:

   You can call this function from anywhere in your app, such as in a button's `onPressed` callback.

   ```dart
   ElevatedButton(
     onPressed: () => runCommand('ls'), // Example command for Unix-based systems
     child: Text('Run Command'),
   );
   ```

This setup allows you to execute shell commands directly from your Flutter application, providing a powerful way to enhance functionality.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cli_pkg/cli_pkg.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'CLI Package Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('CLI Package Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () => runCommand('ls'), // Example command for Unix-based systems
            child: Text('Run Command'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to run a shell command
  Future<void> runCommand(String command) async {
    try {
      // Execute the command using CLI.run
      final result = await CLI.run(command);
      
      // Print the standard output of the command
      print('Command Output: ${result.stdout}');
      
      // Print any errors that occurred during command execution
      if (result.stderr.isNotEmpty) {
        print('Command Error: ${result.stderr}');
      }
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any exceptions that occur during command execution
      print('Error executing command: $e');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the runCommand function is called with the command 'ls'.
// 5. The runCommand function executes the command using CLI.run and captures the output.
// 6. The output and any errors are printed to the console.
// 7. If an error occurs during command execution, it is caught and printed.
```
