<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Huawei HMS Availability Flutter Package

The `huawei_hmsavailability` Flutter package is designed to facilitate the integration of Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) into Flutter applications. This package allows developers to check the availability of HMS on a device, ensuring that their applications can leverage Huawei's services effectively. 

## When to Use This Package
You should consider using the `huawei_hmsavailability` package when:
- Developing applications specifically for Huawei devices that rely on HMS.
- You need to check if HMS is available on the user's device before attempting to use any HMS features.
- You want to provide a seamless user experience by handling scenarios where HMS is not available.

## Features
- **Availability Check**: Easily check if HMS is available on the device.
- **Error Handling**: Provides detailed error messages when HMS is not available.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS devices, although primarily focused on Huawei devices.

This package is essential for developers looking to ensure their applications can utilize Huawei's ecosystem effectively while providing fallback options for users without HMS.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Huawei HMS Availability Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `huawei_hmsavailability` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  huawei_hmsavailability: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. **Update Android Manifest**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

2. **Add Huawei Services**: Ensure you have the Huawei services configured in your project. You may need to include the Huawei services SDK in your `build.gradle` file.

### iOS Configuration
1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the necessary CocoaPods installed for the package to work correctly.

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to check for HMS availability.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:huawei_hmsavailability/huawei_hmsavailability.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('HMS Availability Check')),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder(
            future: checkHMSAvailability(),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } else {
                return Text('HMS is available: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<bool> checkHMSAvailability() async {
    // Check if HMS is available on the device
    final availability = await HmsAvailability.checkHmsAvailability();
    return availability == HmsAvailability.HMS_AVAILABLE;
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple Flutter application that checks for HMS availability and displays the result.

# Complete Example of Using the Huawei HMS Availability Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:huawei_hmsavailability/huawei_hmsavailability.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('HMS Availability Check')),
        body: Center(
          child: FutureBuilder(
            future: checkHMSAvailability(),
            builder: (context, snapshot) {
              // While waiting for the HMS availability check, show a loading indicator
              if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                return CircularProgressIndicator();
              } 
              // If there's an error, display the error message
              else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
              } 
              // If HMS is available, display the result
              else {
                return Text('HMS is available: ${snapshot.data}');
              }
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<bool> checkHMSAvailability() async {
    // Check if HMS is available on the device
    final availability = await HmsAvailability.checkHmsAvailability();
    // Return true if HMS is available, otherwise false
    return availability == HmsAvailability.HMS_AVAILABLE;
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, which sets up the app's structure.
// 3. A FutureBuilder is used to handle the asynchronous check for HMS availability.
// 4. While waiting for the result, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 5. If an error occurs during the check, it is displayed on the screen.
// 6. If HMS is available, a message indicating its availability is shown.
```
