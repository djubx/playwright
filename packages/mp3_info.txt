# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using mp3_info

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `mp3_info` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mp3_info: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read external storage. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add a usage description for accessing the user's media library. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your music library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to use the `mp3_info` package to extract metadata from an MP3 file.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:mp3_info/mp3_info.dart';
```

2. Use the `Mp3Info` class to retrieve metadata:

```dart
void getMp3Info(String filePath) async {
  // Create an instance of Mp3Info
  Mp3Info mp3Info = Mp3Info(filePath);

  // Retrieve the metadata
  var info = await mp3Info.read();

  // Print the metadata
  print('Title: ${info['title']}');
  print('Artist: ${info['artist']}');
  print('Album: ${info['album']}');
  print('Genre: ${info['genre']}');
}
```

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `mp3_info` package into your Flutter application and start extracting metadata from MP3 files.

# Complete Example of Using mp3_info

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mp3_info/mp3_info.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'MP3 Info Example',
      home: Mp3InfoScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class Mp3InfoScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _Mp3InfoScreenState createState() => _Mp3InfoScreenState();
}

class _Mp3InfoScreenState extends State<Mp3InfoScreen> {
  String _title = '';
  String _artist = '';
  String _album = '';
  String _genre = '';

  // Function to get MP3 info
  void _getMp3Info() async {
    // Specify the path to your MP3 file
    String filePath = 'path/to/your/audiofile.mp3'; // Update this path

    // Create an instance of Mp3Info
    Mp3Info mp3Info = Mp3Info(filePath);

    // Retrieve the metadata
    var info = await mp3Info.read();

    // Update the state with the retrieved metadata
    setState(() {
      _title = info['title'] ?? 'Unknown Title';
      _artist = info['artist'] ?? 'Unknown Artist';
      _album = info['album'] ?? 'Unknown Album';
      _genre = info['genre'] ?? 'Unknown Genre';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('MP3 Info Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Title: $_title'),
            Text('Artist: $_artist'),
            Text('Album: $_album'),
            Text('Genre: $_genre'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _getMp3Info,
              child: Text('Get MP3 Info'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (Mp3InfoScreen).
// 3. Mp3InfoScreen is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the MP3 metadata.
// 4. When the user presses the "Get MP3 Info" button, the _getMp3Info function is called.
// 5. This function creates an instance of Mp3Info with the specified file path and retrieves the metadata.
// 6. The state is updated with the retrieved metadata, which is then displayed on the screen.
```
