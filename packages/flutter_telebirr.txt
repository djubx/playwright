# Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_telebirr` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_telebirr` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_telebirr: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the correct SDK versions:

   ```groovy
   android {
       compileSdkVersion 31
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           targetSdkVersion 31
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed and run:

   ```bash
   pod install
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to initiate a payment:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_telebirr/flutter_telebirr.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Telebirr Payment Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Initialize Telebirr payment
              final result = await TelebirrPayment.initiatePayment(
                amount: 1000, // Amount in ETB
                phoneNumber: '0912345678', // User's phone number
              );

              // Handle the payment result
              if (result.success) {
                // Payment was successful
                print('Payment successful: ${result.transactionId}');
              } else {
                // Payment failed
                print('Payment failed: ${result.errorMessage}');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pay with Telebirr'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with a button that initiates a payment when pressed. The `TelebirrPayment.initiatePayment` method is called with the amount and the user's phone number.

# Complete Example of flutter_telebirr

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application using the `flutter_telebirr` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_telebirr/flutter_telebirr.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Telebirr Payment Example',
      home: PaymentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Telebirr Payment')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            // Step 1: Initiate the payment process
            final result = await TelebirrPayment.initiatePayment(
              amount: 1000, // Amount in ETB
              phoneNumber: '0912345678', // User's phone number
            );

            // Step 2: Handle the payment result
            if (result.success) {
              // Payment was successful
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Payment successful: ${result.transactionId}')),
              );
            } else {
              // Payment failed
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('Payment failed: ${result.errorMessage}')),
              );
            }
          },
          child: Text('Pay with Telebirr'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen (PaymentScreen).
// 3. The PaymentScreen contains a button that, when pressed, initiates a payment using the Telebirr API.
// 4. The payment amount and user's phone number are passed to the initiatePayment method.
// 5. The result of the payment is checked; if successful, a success message is shown, otherwise an error message is displayed.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this complete example, we have a simple Flutter application that allows users to make payments using Telebirr. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the payment process, handles the result, and provides feedback to the user based on the outcome of the transaction. 

By following this guide, you can effectively integrate the `flutter_telebirr` package into your Flutter applications, providing a valuable payment option for your users.
