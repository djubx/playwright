## When to Use

You should consider using the **simple_logger** package in scenarios such as:
- **Debugging**: When you need to track the flow of your application and identify issues.
- **Monitoring**: To log important events and errors in production for later analysis.
- **Development**: To provide insights into the application's performance and behavior during development.

## Features

- **Multiple Log Levels**: Supports various log levels including debug, info, warning, error, and fatal.
- **Customizable Output**: You can customize the output format and destination (console, file).

# Tutorial: Setting Up Simple Logger

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **simple_logger** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **simple_logger** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  simple_logger: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to log messages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_logger/simple_logger.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final logger = SimpleLogger();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    logger.info("MyApp started"); // Log an info message

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Simple Logger Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              logger.warning("Button pressed!"); // Log a warning message
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we log an info message when the app starts and a warning message when the button is pressed.

# Complete Example of Simple Logger

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_logger/simple_logger.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // Create an instance of SimpleLogger
  final logger = SimpleLogger();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Log an info message when the app starts
    logger.info("MyApp started");

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Simple Logger Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log a warning message when the button is pressed
              logger.warning("Button pressed!");
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. MyApp is instantiated and run using runApp().
// 3. Inside MyApp, an instance of SimpleLogger is created.
// 4. An info log is generated when the app starts, indicating that MyApp has started.
// 5. The MaterialApp widget is built, containing a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// 7. When the button is pressed, a warning log is generated, indicating that the button was pressed.
// 8. The logs can be viewed in the console, providing insights into the application's behavior.
