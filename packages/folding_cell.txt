# Folding Cell Flutter Package

The **folding_cell** package is a Flutter widget that allows developers to create a folding cell effect, which can be used to display additional information in a compact manner. This package is particularly useful for creating interactive UIs where space is limited, such as in mobile applications. The folding cell can be expanded or collapsed, providing a smooth transition that enhances user experience.

## When to Use

You might consider using the **folding_cell** package in scenarios such as:
- **Expandable Lists**: When you want to show more details about a list item without taking up too much screen space.
- **FAQs**: For frequently asked questions where users can tap to reveal answers.
- **Settings**: To hide advanced settings under a collapsible section.

## Features
- **Customizable Animation**: The folding effect can be customized to fit the design of your application.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both Android and iOS platforms.

Overall, the **folding_cell** package is a powerful tool for enhancing the interactivity and usability of Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Folding Cell Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To use the **folding_cell** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  folding_cell: ^0.3.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:folding_cell/folding_cell.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Folding Cell

You can now use the `FoldingCell` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
FoldingCell(
  frontWidget: FrontWidget(), // Your front widget
  innerWidget: InnerWidget(), // Your inner widget
  onOpen: () => print('Cell opened'),
  onClose: () => print('Cell closed'),
)
```

This will create a folding cell that can be opened and closed, revealing additional content.

# Complete Example of Using the Folding Cell Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:folding_cell/folding_cell.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Folding Cell Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Folding Cell Demo'),
        ),
        body: FoldingCellDemo(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class FoldingCellDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView(
      children: <Widget>[
        // Creating a folding cell
        FoldingCell(
          // Front widget displayed when the cell is closed
          frontWidget: FrontWidget(),
          // Inner widget displayed when the cell is opened
          innerWidget: InnerWidget(),
          // Callbacks for open and close events
          onOpen: () => print('Cell opened'),
          onClose: () => print('Cell closed'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Front widget displayed when the cell is closed
class FrontWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      height: 100,
      color: Colors.blue,
      child: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Tap to Expand',
          style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Inner widget displayed when the cell is opened
class InnerWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      height: 100,
      color: Colors.green,
      child: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Expanded Content',
          style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body that displays the FoldingCellDemo widget.
// 4. FoldingCellDemo creates a ListView with a single FoldingCell.
// 5. The FoldingCell has a front widget (FrontWidget) and an inner widget (InnerWidget).
// 6. When the front widget is tapped, the cell expands to show the inner widget.
// 7. The onOpen and onClose callbacks print messages to the console when the cell is opened or closed.
```
