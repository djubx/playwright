The `const_date_time` package is a powerful utility for managing date and time in Flutter applications. It provides a set of constants and functions that simplify the handling of date and time values, making it easier for developers to work with time zones, formatting, and calculations.

## When to Use `const_date_time`

You should consider using the `const_date_time` package in scenarios such as:

- **Date and Time Formatting**: When you need to display dates and times in a user-friendly format.
- **Time Zone Management**: If your application requires handling multiple time zones.
- **Date Calculations**: For performing operations like adding or subtracting days, months, or years from a given date.

## Key Features

- **Constant Date and Time Values**: Predefined constants for common date and time values.
- **Easy Formatting**: Simple methods to format dates and times according to user preferences.
- **Time Zone Support**: Built-in support for managing different time zones.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `const_date_time`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `const_date_time` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  const_date_time: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` to include any necessary permissions related to date and time access, although the `const_date_time` package does not require special permissions.

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package as follows:

```dart
import 'package:const_date_time/const_date_time.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the features of the `const_date_time` package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to format the current date and time:

```dart
void main() {
  final now = ConstDateTime.now();
  print('Current Date and Time: ${now.format()}');
}
```

This will print the current date and time in a readable format.

By following these steps, you can successfully set up and start using the `const_date_time` package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using `const_date_time`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:const_date_time/const_date_time.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Const Date Time Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Date and Time Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DateTimeDisplay(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DateTimeDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current date and time using the const_date_time package
    final now = ConstDateTime.now();
    
    // Format the current date and time
    final formattedDateTime = now.format();

    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text(
          'Current Date and Time:',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 10),
        Text(
          formattedDateTime,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Date and Time Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold centers a DateTimeDisplay widget.
// 5. The DateTimeDisplay widget retrieves the current date and time using ConstDateTime.now().
// 6. It formats the date and time using the format() method provided by the package.
// 7. Finally, it displays the formatted date and time in a Column widget, with appropriate styling.
