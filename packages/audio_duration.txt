# Setup and Usage

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the `audio_duration` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  audio_duration: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Import the Package

Import the `audio_duration` package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:audio_duration/audio_duration.dart';
```

## Step 3: Use the Package

Use the `AudioDuration` class to retrieve the duration of an audio file:

```dart
void main() async {
  final audioDuration = await AudioDuration.getAudioDuration(
    filePath: 'path/to/your/audio/file.mp3',
  );
  print('Audio duration: ${audioDuration.inSeconds} seconds');
}
```

### Platform-Specific Details

*   **Android:** The `audio_duration` package uses the `MediaExtractor` class to retrieve audio duration. This class is available on Android API level 16 and above.
*   **iOS:** The `audio_duration` package uses the `AVAudioPlayer` class to retrieve audio duration. This class is available on iOS 4.0 and above.

### Required Configurations or Optimizations

*   Make sure to handle errors and exceptions properly when using the `audio_duration` package.
*   If you're working with large audio files, consider using a streaming approach to avoid loading the entire file into memory.

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:audio_duration/audio_duration.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _audioDuration = '';

  // Step 1: Define the audio file path
  final String _audioFilePath = 'path/to/your/audio/file.mp3';

  // Step 2: Create a button to retrieve the audio duration
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Audio Duration Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text(_audioDuration),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _getAudioDuration,
                child: Text('Get Audio Duration'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Step 3: Define the function to retrieve the audio duration
  void _getAudioDuration() async {
    try {
      final audioDuration = await AudioDuration.getAudioDuration(
        filePath: _audioFilePath,
      );
      setState(() {
        _audioDuration = 'Audio duration: ${audioDuration.inSeconds} seconds';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error: $e');
    }
  }
}
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and sees a button to retrieve the audio duration.
// 2. When the user clicks the button, the `_getAudioDuration` function is called.
// 3. The `_getAudioDuration` function uses the `AudioDuration` class to retrieve the audio duration.
// 4. The audio duration is then displayed on the screen.
// 5. If an error occurs during the process, the error message is printed to the console.

// In summary, this code demonstrates how to use the `audio_duration` package to retrieve the duration of an audio file and display it on the screen.
