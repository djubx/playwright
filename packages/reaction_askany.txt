        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

```dart
// Example usage of the Reaction AskAny package
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: QuestionPage(),
    );
  }
}

class QuestionPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Question and Answer')),
      body: ReactionAskAny(
        question: 'What is your favorite programming language?',
        options: ['Dart', 'Java', 'Python', 'JavaScript'],
        onAnswerSelected: (answer) {
          // Handle the selected answer
          print('User selected: $answer');

# Complete Example of Reaction AskAny

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reaction_askany/reaction_askany.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Reaction AskAny Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: QuestionPage(),
    );
  }
}

class QuestionPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Question and Answer')),
      body: ReactionAskAny(
        question: 'What is your favorite programming language?',
        options: ['Dart', 'Java', 'Python', 'JavaScript'],
        onAnswerSelected: (answer) {
          // Handle the selected answer
          print('User selected: $answer');
          // Show a dialog with the selected answer
          showDialog(
            context: context,
            builder: (context) {
              return AlertDialog(
                title: Text('Your Answer'),
                content: Text('You selected: $answer'),
                actions: [
                  TextButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                    },
                    child: Text('OK'),
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies QuestionPage as the home widget.
// 3. QuestionPage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing the ReactionAskAny widget.
// 4. ReactionAskAny displays a question and options for the user to select.
// 5. When the user selects an answer, the onAnswerSelected callback is triggered.
// 6. The selected answer is printed to the console and displayed in a dialog box for user confirmation.
```
