# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Iconsax Plus

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **iconsax_plus** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  iconsax_plus: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:iconsax_plus/iconsax_plus.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Icons in Your Application

You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Here’s how to use an icon in a simple `IconButton`:

```dart
IconButton(
  icon: Icon(Iconsax.plus),
  onPressed: () {
    // Action when the button is pressed
  },
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, make sure to enable the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific capabilities.

## Step 5: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons by changing their size and color. Here’s an example:

```dart
Icon(
  Iconsax.home,
  size: 30.0, // Set the size of the icon
  color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the icon
)
```

With these steps, you can easily set up and start using the **iconsax_plus** package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Iconsax Plus in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iconsax_plus/iconsax_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Iconsax Plus Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Iconsax Plus Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying an icon using Iconsax
            Icon(
              Iconsax.home,
              size: 50.0, // Set the size of the icon
              color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the icon
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between the icon and text
            Text(
              'Home Icon',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 40), // Add space before the button
            // IconButton using Iconsax
            IconButton(
              icon: Icon(Iconsax.add),
              iconSize: 50.0, // Set the size of the icon button
              color: Colors.green, // Set the color of the icon button
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when the button is pressed
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('Add button pressed!')),
                );
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is another StatelessWidget.
// 4. HomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 5. The Column displays an icon from Iconsax, followed by a text label.
// 6. Below the text, an IconButton is created using another icon from Iconsax.
// 7. When the IconButton is pressed, a SnackBar is shown with a message.
// 8. The app demonstrates how to use icons from the Iconsax package effectively.
