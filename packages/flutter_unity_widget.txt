# Setting Up the Flutter Unity Widget

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_unity_widget` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_unity_widget` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_unity_widget: ^0.1.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions and activity:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <application>
       <activity
           android:name="com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity"
           android:label="UnityActivity"
           android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.NoActionBar">
           <intent-filter>
               <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
               <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
           </intent-filter>
       </activity>
   </application>
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `android/build.gradle` file includes the following:

   ```groovy
   allprojects {
       repositories {
           google()
           mavenCentral()
           maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the camera for AR features.</string>
   ```

2. **Podfile**: Ensure your `ios/Podfile` is set to use frameworks:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   use_frameworks!
   ```

## Step 3: Initialize Unity in Flutter

Now that we have configured our project, we can initialize Unity in our Flutter application. Here’s how to do it:

1. **Create a new Flutter widget** that will host the Unity view.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_unity_widget/flutter_unity_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late UnityWidgetController _unityWidgetController;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Unity Widget Example')),
      body: UnityWidget(
        onUnityCreated: onUnityCreated,
      ),
    );
  }

  void onUnityCreated(UnityWidgetController controller) {
    _unityWidgetController = controller;
  }
}
```

2. **Run the Application**: You can now run your application on an Android or iOS device to see the Unity view in action.

This setup allows you to integrate Unity content into your Flutter application seamlessly. You can now start building your interactive experiences!

# Complete Example of Flutter Unity Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_unity_widget/flutter_unity_widget.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late UnityWidgetController _unityWidgetController;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Unity Widget Example')),
      body: UnityWidget(
        onUnityCreated: onUnityCreated, // Callback when Unity is created
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Example of sending a message to Unity
          _unityWidgetController.postMessage(
            'GameObjectName', // Name of the GameObject in Unity
            'MethodName',     // Method to call in Unity
            'Message',        // Message to send
          );
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.send),
      ),
    );
  }

  void onUnityCreated(UnityWidgetController controller) {
    _unityWidgetController = controller; // Store the controller for later use
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The UnityWidget is created, and the onUnityCreated callback is triggered when Unity is ready.
// 3. The FloatingActionButton allows users to send messages to Unity, demonstrating communication between Flutter and Unity.
// 4. The Unity view is displayed in the body of the Scaffold, providing a seamless integration of 3D content within the Flutter app.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this complete example, we have created a simple Flutter application that integrates Unity content. The `RealFlutter` widget initializes the Unity view and provides a button to send messages to Unity. The comments within the code explain the flow of the application step-by-step, making it easy to understand how the integration works.

### Final Summary

The `flutter_unity_widget` package allows developers to create rich, interactive applications by combining the strengths of Flutter and Unity. By following the setup and example provided, you can easily integrate Unity content into your Flutter applications, enabling a wide range of possibilities for game development, AR experiences, and 3D visualizations.
