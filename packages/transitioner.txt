# Transitioner Flutter Package

The **Transitioner** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to create smooth and customizable transitions between screens in their applications. It provides a simple API to manage transitions, allowing developers to focus on building their app's functionality while ensuring a polished user experience.

## When to Use Transitioner
- When you want to enhance the user experience with smooth transitions between different screens.
- If you need to implement complex animations that are not easily achievable with standard Flutter navigation.
- When you want to maintain a consistent look and feel across your app's navigation.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Transitions**: Easily define your own transition animations.
- **Multiple Transition Types**: Supports various transition types such as fade, slide, and scale.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter's navigation system.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Built with performance in mind, ensuring smooth animations even on lower-end devices.

Overall, the Transitioner package is an excellent choice for developers looking to add a layer of polish to their Flutter applications through enhanced navigation transitions.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Transitioner

## Installation
To get started with the Transitioner package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  transitioner: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, make sure to set the deployment target to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Using Transitioner
To use the Transitioner package, you will typically wrap your navigation calls with the `Transitioner` widget. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement a fade transition:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:transitioner/transitioner.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: FirstScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FirstScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('First Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the second screen with a fade transition
            Transitioner(
              context: context,
              child: SecondScreen(),
              transition: TransitionType.fade,
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Screen')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Second Screen!')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, the app navigates to the `SecondScreen` with a fade transition. You can easily change the transition type by modifying the `transition` parameter.

# Complete Example of Transitioner in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:transitioner/transitioner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: FirstScreen(), // Start with the FirstScreen
    );
  }
}

class FirstScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('First Screen')), // AppBar for the first screen
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // When the button is pressed, navigate to the SecondScreen
            Transitioner(
              context: context, // Pass the current context
              child: SecondScreen(), // The screen to navigate to
              transition: TransitionType.fade, // Define the transition type
            );
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Screen'), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Screen')), // AppBar for the second screen
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Second Screen!')), // Display a message
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which initializes the MaterialApp.
// 2. The FirstScreen widget is displayed as the home screen.
// 3. When the user presses the button, the Transitioner widget is called.
// 4. The Transitioner takes the current context, the SecondScreen widget, and the desired transition type (fade).
// 5. The app navigates to the SecondScreen with a smooth fade transition.
// 6. The SecondScreen displays a simple message to the user.
```
