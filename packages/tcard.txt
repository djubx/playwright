Here's a detailed technical blog on the "tcard" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# TCard Flutter Package

The **TCard** package is a powerful and flexible Flutter widget that allows developers to create card-based interfaces with swipeable functionality. This package is particularly useful for applications that require user interaction through swiping gestures, such as dating apps, product showcases, or any scenario where users need to make quick decisions.

## When to Use TCard

You should consider using the TCard package when:
- You want to implement a card stack interface where users can swipe left or right to make choices.
- Your application requires a visually appealing way to present information or options.
- You need to handle user interactions in a smooth and responsive manner.

## Features

- **Swipeable Cards**: Users can swipe cards left or right, triggering specific actions based on the swipe direction.
- **Customizable**: The appearance and behavior of the cards can be easily customized to fit the design of your application.
- **Event Callbacks**: The package provides callbacks for swipe events, allowing developers to execute specific actions when a card is swiped.
- **Animation Support**: Smooth animations enhance the user experience, making interactions feel more natural.

Overall, the TCard package is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement a card-based UI in their Flutter applications.

# TCard Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the TCard package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tcard: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the TCard package:

```dart
import 'package:tcard/tcard.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using TCard

You can now use the TCard widget in your application. Below is a simple example of how to implement it.

# Complete Example of TCard in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tcard/tcard.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'TCard Example',
      home: TCardExample(),
    );
  }
}

class TCardExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TCardExampleState createState() => _TCardExampleState();
}

class _TCardExampleState extends State<TCardExample> {
  // List of cards to display
  final List<String> cards = [
    'Card 1',
    'Card 2',
    'Card 3',
    'Card 4',
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('TCard Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: TCard(
          // List of widgets to display as cards
          cards: cards.map((card) {
            return Card(
              child: Container(
                height: 300,
                width: 200,
                alignment: Alignment.center,
                child: Text(
                  card,
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
            );
          }).toList(),
          // Callback for when a card is swiped
          onSwipe: (index, direction) {
            // Handle the swipe action
            print('Card $index swiped to the $direction');
          },
          // Callback for when all cards are swiped
          onEnd: () {
            print('All cards have been swiped!');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. TCardExample is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the card stack.
// 4. The build method of TCardExample creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a TCard widget.
// 5. The TCard widget takes a list of cards, which are displayed as Card widgets.
// 6. The onSwipe callback is triggered when a card is swiped, logging the index and direction of the swipe.
// 7. The onEnd callback is triggered when all cards have been swiped, logging a message to the console.
```
