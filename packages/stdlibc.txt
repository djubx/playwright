# stdlibc Flutter Package
The stdlibc package is a Flutter plugin that provides a set of standard C libraries for use in Flutter applications. This package is useful when you need to perform tasks that require direct access to the underlying C libraries, such as file I/O, network operations, or cryptographic functions.

Some examples of when to use this package include:

* Reading and writing files to the device's file system
* Making network requests using the `curl` library
* Performing cryptographic operations using the `openssl` library
* Interacting with the device's hardware, such as the camera or GPS

The stdlibc package provides a range of features, including:

* File I/O operations (e.g. `fopen`, `fread`, `fwrite`)
* Network operations (e.g. `curl_easy_init`, `curl_easy_setopt`)
* Cryptographic functions (e.g. `openssl_encrypt`, `openssl_decrypt`)
* String manipulation functions (e.g. `strcpy`, `strcat`)

# Setting up the stdlibc Package
To use the stdlibc package in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. Add the stdlibc package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  stdlibc: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the stdlibc package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:stdlibc/stdlibc.dart';
```
4. Use the stdlibc functions as needed in your application.

### Platform-Specific Details

* Android: The stdlibc package uses the Android NDK to provide access to the C libraries. You may need to configure your Android project to use the NDK.
* iOS: The stdlibc package uses the iOS SDK to provide access to the C libraries. You may need to configure your iOS project to use the SDK.

### Configurations and Optimizations

* You may need to configure your project to use the correct architecture (e.g. armv7, arm64) to match the device's architecture.
* You can optimize your application's performance by using the `release` build configuration.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stdlibc/stdlibc.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _fileContents = '';

  // Step 1: Create a file using the stdlibc library
  void _createFile() {
    // Create a file pointer using the fopen function
    Pointer<FILE> filePtr = fopen('example.txt', 'w');

    // Check if the file was created successfully
    if (filePtr != null) {
      // Write to the file using the fwrite function
      fwrite('Hello, world!', 1, 13, filePtr);

      // Close the file using the fclose function
      fclose(filePtr);
    }
  }

  // Step 2: Read the file using the stdlibc library
  void _readFile() {
    // Create a file pointer using the fopen function
    Pointer<FILE> filePtr = fopen('example.txt', 'r');

    // Check if the file was opened successfully
    if (filePtr != null) {
      // Read from the file using the fread function
      char buffer[1024];
      fread(buffer, 1, 1024, filePtr);

      // Close the file using the fclose function
      fclose(filePtr);

      // Update the UI with the file contents
      setState(() {
        _fileContents = String.fromCharCodes(buffer);
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Stdlibc Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(_fileContents),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _createFile,
                child: Text('Create File'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 10),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _readFile,
                child: Text('Read File'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user clicks the "Create File" button, which calls the _createFile function.
// 2. The _createFile function creates a file using the stdlibc library and writes to it.
// 3. The user clicks the "Read File" button, which calls the _readFile function.
// 4. The _readFile function reads from the file using the stdlibc library and updates the UI with the file contents.

// The stdlibc library provides a range of functions for working with files, including fopen, fwrite, and fread.
// These functions can be used to create, write to, and read from files in a Flutter application.
