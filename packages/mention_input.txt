- You need to provide a user-friendly interface for selecting users from a list.
- You want to enhance user engagement by enabling tagging features.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Mention Suggestions**: Easily customize the list of users that can be mentioned.
- **Flexible Input Handling**: Supports various input formats and can be integrated with existing text input fields.
- **User Interface**: Provides a clean and intuitive UI for selecting mentions.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `mention_input`

## Installation
To get started with the `mention_input` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mention_input: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/mention_input).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. However, the `mention_input` package does not require any specific configurations beyond the standard Flutter setup.

## Basic Usage
To use the `mention_input` package, you can create a simple mention input field in your Flutter application. Below is a basic example of how to implement it.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mention_input/mention_input.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mention Input Example')),
        body: MentionInputExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MentionInputExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MentionInputExampleState createState() => _MentionInputExampleState();
}

class _MentionInputExampleState extends State<MentionInputExample> {
  final List<String> _users = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'];
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: MentionInput(
        controller: _controller,
        suggestionsCallback: (pattern) {
          return _users.where((user) => user.toLowerCase().contains(pattern.toLowerCase()));
        },
        onMentionSelected: (mention) {
          // Handle the mention selection
          print('Mentioned: $mention');
        },
        decoration: InputDecoration(
          hintText: 'Type a message...',
          border: OutlineInputBorder(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a mention input field that suggests users as you type.

# Complete Example of `mention_input`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mention_input/mention_input.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Mention Input Example')),
        body: MentionInputExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MentionInputExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MentionInputExampleState createState() => _MentionInputExampleState();
}

class _MentionInputExampleState extends State<MentionInputExample> {
  // List of users to mention
  final List<String> _users = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'];
  // Controller for the text input
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: MentionInput(
        controller: _controller,
        // Callback to provide suggestions based on user input
        suggestionsCallback: (pattern) {
          // Filter users based on the input pattern
          return _users.where((user) => user.toLowerCase().contains(pattern.toLowerCase()));
        },
        // Callback when a mention is selected
        onMentionSelected: (mention) {
          // Print the selected mention to the console
          print('Mentioned: $mention');
        },
        // Input decoration for the text field
        decoration: InputDecoration(
          hintText: 'Type a message...',
          border: OutlineInputBorder(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which sets up the MaterialApp and the main scaffold.
// 2. The MentionInputExample widget is created, which contains the mention input field.
// 3. A list of users is defined for mention suggestions.
// 4. The MentionInput widget is used to create a text input field that suggests users based on the input.
// 5. The suggestionsCallback filters the user list based on the input pattern.
// 6. When a user selects a mention, the onMentionSelected callback is triggered, printing the mentioned user to the console.
// 7. The input field is styled with a hint and an outline border for better user experience.
