- **Direction Control**: Choose to scroll text left or right.
- **Text Style Customization**: Easily customize the text style, including font size, color, and weight.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Text Scroll Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the **text_scroll** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  text_scroll: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a scrolling text widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_scroll/text_scroll.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Text Scroll Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TextScroll(
            'This is a scrolling text example using the text_scroll package.',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24.0, color: Colors.blue),
            velocity: Velocity(pixelsPerSecond: Offset(50, 0)), // Speed of scrolling
            pause: Duration(seconds: 1), // Pause duration at the end
            startAfter: Duration(seconds: 1), // Delay before starting
            mode: TextScrollMode.bouncing, // Bouncing effect
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays scrolling text in the center of the screen. The text scrolls horizontally with a specified speed and pauses at the end.

# Complete Example of Text Scroll Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_scroll/text_scroll.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Text Scroll Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: TextScroll(
            'This is a scrolling text example using the text_scroll package.',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24.0, color: Colors.blue), // Text style
            velocity: Velocity(pixelsPerSecond: Offset(50, 0)), // Speed of scrolling
            pause: Duration(seconds: 1), // Pause duration at the end
            startAfter: Duration(seconds: 1), // Delay before starting
            mode: TextScrollMode.bouncing, // Bouncing effect
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, we center the TextScroll widget.
// 5. The TextScroll widget takes a string of text and scrolls it horizontally.
// 6. The scrolling speed is controlled by the velocity parameter.
// 7. The pause parameter defines how long the text will pause at the end of the scroll.
// 8. The startAfter parameter sets a delay before the scrolling starts.
// 9. The mode parameter allows for different scrolling effects, in this case, a bouncing effect.
```

In summary, the **text_scroll** package provides a simple yet effective way to display scrolling text in Flutter applications. By following the setup and usage instructions, you can easily integrate this package into your projects, enhancing the user experience with dynamic text displays.
