# Intercom Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The `intercom_flutter` package is a powerful tool for integrating Intercom's customer messaging platform into your Flutter applications. Intercom is widely used for customer support, marketing, and engagement, providing a seamless way to communicate with users directly within your app. This package bridges the gap between Flutter and Intercom, allowing developers to leverage Intercom's features in a cross-platform environment.

## When to Use `intercom_flutter`

- **Customer Support**: If your app requires real-time customer support, integrating Intercom can provide users with instant access to help.
- **User Engagement**: Use Intercom to send targeted messages and notifications to engage users based on their behavior and preferences.
- **Feedback Collection**: Gather user feedback directly through the app to improve your product and user experience.

## Key Features

- **In-App Messaging**: Communicate with users through chat and messages without leaving the app.
- **User Tracking**: Track user activity and behavior to provide personalized support and messages.
- **Push Notifications**: Send push notifications to re-engage users and inform them about updates or offers.
- **Rich Media Support**: Send and receive images, videos, and other media types within messages.

# Setting Up `intercom_flutter` in Your Flutter Project

Integrating `intercom_flutter` into your Flutter project involves several steps, including platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS. Below is a detailed guide to help you get started.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

Add `intercom_flutter` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  intercom_flutter: ^4.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Setup

### Android

1. **Modify `android/app/build.gradle`:**

   Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       defaultConfig {
           minSdkVersion 21
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Add Intercom Initialization:**

   In your `MainActivity.java` or `MainActivity.kt`, initialize Intercom in the `onCreate` method:

   ```java
   import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity;
   import io.flutter.plugins.intercom.IntercomFlutterPlugin;

   public class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity {
       @Override
       public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
           super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
           IntercomFlutterPlugin.initialize(this, "YOUR_APP_ID", "YOUR_API_KEY");
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS

1. **Modify `ios/Podfile`:**

   Ensure platform version is set to 11.0 or higher:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '11.0'
   ```

2. **Add Intercom Initialization:**

   In your `AppDelegate.swift`, initialize Intercom in the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:

   ```swift
   import UIKit
   import Flutter
   import Intercom

   @UIApplicationMain
   @objc class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
       override func application(
           _ application: UIApplication,
           didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
       ) -> Bool {
           Intercom.setApiKey("YOUR_API_KEY", forAppId: "YOUR_APP_ID")
           GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)
           return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
       }
   }
   ```

## Step 3: Using the Package

After setting up, you can start using Intercom features in your Flutter app. Below is a simple example of how to display the Intercom messenger:

```dart
import 'package:intercom_flutter/intercom_flutter.dart';

void showIntercomMessenger() {
  Intercom.instance.displayMessenger();
}
```

<-- MAIN -->

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:intercom_flutter/intercom_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Intercom Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Intercom with your app ID and API key
    Intercom.instance.initialize('YOUR_APP_ID', 'YOUR_API_KEY');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Intercom Flutter Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Display the Intercom messenger when the button is pressed
            Intercom.instance.displayMessenger();
          },
          child: Text('Open Intercom Messenger'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The app starts by running the main function, which initializes the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title, theme, and home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen is a StatefulWidget that initializes Intercom in its initState method.
// 4. The build method of HomeScreen returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it triggers the displayMessenger method from the Intercom instance, opening the Intercom chat interface.
```
