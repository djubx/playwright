# Figma2Flutter Package Overview
=====================================

The `figma2flutter` package is a powerful tool for converting Figma designs into Flutter widgets. It allows designers and developers to collaborate more efficiently by automatically generating Flutter code from Figma designs.

## When to Use Figma2Flutter
---------------------------

* When you want to quickly prototype a Flutter app from a Figma design.
* When you want to reduce the time and effort required to translate a design into code.
* When you want to ensure that your Flutter app is pixel-perfect and matches the original design.

## Features
------------

* Supports a wide range of Figma design elements, including text, images, shapes, and more.
* Automatically generates Flutter widgets from Figma designs.
* Allows for customization and override of generated code.

# Setting Up Figma2Flutter
==========================

To use the `figma2flutter` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Flutter Project

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  figma2flutter: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:figma2flutter/figma2flutter.dart';
```
### Step 3: Load Your Figma Design

Load your Figma design file using the `FigmaDesign` class:
```dart
FigmaDesign design = FigmaDesign.fromJson('path/to/design.json');
```
### Step 4: Generate Flutter Widgets

Use the `Figma2Flutter` class to generate Flutter widgets from your Figma design:
```dart
RealFlutter widgets = RealFlutter(design);
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* For Android, make sure to add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<application android:hardwareAccelerated="true">
```
* For iOS, make sure to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>
<false/>
```
### Required Configurations and Optimizations

* Make sure to configure your Figma design file to use the correct dimensions and resolution.
* Optimize your generated Flutter code by using the ` flutter pub run figma2flutter:optimize` command.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:figma2flutter/figma2flutter.dart';

void main() {
  // Load the Figma design file
  FigmaDesign design = FigmaDesign.fromJson('path/to/design.json');

  // Generate Flutter widgets from the Figma design
  RealFlutter widgets = RealFlutter(design);

  // Create a new Flutter app
  runApp(MyApp(widgets));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final RealFlutter widgets;

  MyApp(this.widgets);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a new Scaffold
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Figma2Flutter Demo'),
      ),
      body: // Use the generated widgets
          widgets.build(context),
    );
  }
}

// The RealFlutter class generates Flutter widgets from a Figma design
class RealFlutter {
  final FigmaDesign design;

  RealFlutter(this.design);

  // Build the Flutter widgets
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a new Column
    return Column(
      children: [
        // Use the Figma design elements to create Flutter widgets
        Text(design.elements[0].text),
        Image.asset(design.elements[1].image),
        // ...
      ],
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The Figma design file is loaded using the FigmaDesign class.
// 2. The RealFlutter class generates Flutter widgets from the Figma design.
// 3. The MyApp class creates a new Flutter app and uses the generated widgets.
// 4. The app is run using the runApp function.
