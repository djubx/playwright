# Setting Up Ollama
==================

To use Ollama, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Here's how:

### Step 1: Add Ollama to Your Project

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  ollama: ^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Import Ollama

Import Ollama in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:ollama/ollama.dart';
```

### Step 3: Configure Ollama

Configure Ollama by creating an instance of the `Ollama` class:

```dart
Ollama ollama = Ollama();
```

### Platform-Specific Details

Ollama works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you need to configure the package differently for each platform.

#### Android

For Android, you need to add the following configuration to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<application
    ...
    android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
    ...>
</application>
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you need to add the following configuration to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ollama/ollama.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ollama Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  Ollama ollama = Ollama();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Ollama
    ollama.init();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Ollama Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Ollama Demo',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Use Ollama to perform some action
                ollama.performAction();
              },
              child: Text('Perform Action'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user launches the app.
// 2. The app initializes Ollama in the initState method.
// 3. The user clicks the "Perform Action" button.
// 4. The app uses Ollama to perform some action.
// 5. The action is completed, and the app displays the result.

// In summary, this code demonstrates how to use Ollama to perform some action in a Flutter app.
// It shows how to initialize Ollama, use it to perform an action, and display the result.
