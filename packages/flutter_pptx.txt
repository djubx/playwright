# Complete Example of Using flutter_pptx

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_pptx/flutter_pptx.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter PPTX Example',
      home: PresentationPage(),
    );
  }
}

class PresentationPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PresentationPageState createState() => _PresentationPageState();
}

class _PresentationPageState extends State<PresentationPage> {
  // Create an instance of the RealFlutter class
  final pptx = RealFlutter();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Create a new presentation when the widget is initialized
    createPresentation();
  }

  void createPresentation() {
    // Start creating a new presentation
    pptx.createPresentation();

    // Add a title slide
    pptx.addSlide('Title Slide', 'Welcome to Flutter PPTX');

    // Add a content slide
    pptx.addSlide('Content Slide', 'This is a sample content slide.');

    // Save the presentation to the device
    pptx.savePresentation('my_presentation.pptx');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter PPTX Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Presentation Created! Check your device.'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. The PresentationPage widget is created, which initializes the presentation in its state.
// 4. In the initState method, createPresentation() is called to start creating a new PowerPoint presentation.
// 5. A title slide and a content slide are added to the presentation.
// 6. The presentation is saved as 'my_presentation.pptx' on the device.
// 7. The UI displays a message indicating that the presentation has been created.
