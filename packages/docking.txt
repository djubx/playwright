Here's a detailed technical blog on the "docking" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Docking Flutter Package

The **docking** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the creation of dockable user interfaces in Flutter applications. This package allows developers to create flexible layouts that can adapt to various screen sizes and orientations, making it particularly useful for applications that require a responsive design.

## When to Use the Docking Package

You should consider using the docking package in scenarios such as:

- **Complex Layouts**: When your application requires a sophisticated layout with multiple panels that can be rearranged or resized.
- **Responsive Design**: For applications that need to adapt to different screen sizes, such as tablets and desktops.
- **Customizable User Interfaces**: When you want to provide users with the ability to customize their workspace by docking and undocking panels.

## Features

- **Docking and Undocking**: Easily dock and undock panels within your application.
- **Resizable Panels**: Users can resize panels to fit their needs.
- **Customizable Layouts**: Create layouts that can be rearranged based on user preferences.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

The docking package is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with dynamic and flexible user interfaces.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Docking Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the docking package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the docking package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  docking: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/docking).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the docking package:

```dart
import 'package:docking/docking.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Docking Package

You can now start using the docking package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to create a dockable interface.

# Complete Example of Using the Docking Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:docking/docking.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Docking Example',
      home: DockingExample(),
    );
  }
}

class DockingExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DockingExampleState createState() => _DockingExampleState();
}

class _DockingExampleState extends State<DockingExample> {
  // This variable holds the current layout state of the dockable panels
  DockingLayout layout;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the layout with default settings
    layout = DockingLayout(
      panels: [
        DockingPanel(
          title: 'Panel 1',
          child: Container(color: Colors.red, width: 200, height: 300),
        ),
        DockingPanel(
          title: 'Panel 2',
          child: Container(color: Colors.green, width: 200, height: 300),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Docking Example')),
      body: DockingLayoutBuilder(
        layout: layout,
        onLayoutChanged: (newLayout) {
          // Update the layout state when it changes
          setState(() {
            layout = newLayout;
          });
        },
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Add a new panel dynamically
          setState(() {
            layout.panels.add(DockingPanel(
              title: 'New Panel',
              child: Container(color: Colors.blue, width: 200, height: 300),
            ));
          });
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to DockingExample.
// 3. DockingExample initializes a DockingLayout with two panels in the initState method.
// 4. The build method of DockingExample returns a Scaffold with an AppBar and a DockingLayoutBuilder.
// 5. DockingLayoutBuilder displays the panels and listens for layout changes.
// 6. When the floating action button is pressed, a new panel is added to the layout dynamically.
// 7. The layout is updated, and the UI reflects the changes immediately.
```

## Summary

In this blog, we explored the **docking** Flutter package, detailing its features and use cases. We walked through the setup process, including platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS. Finally, we provided a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the docking package, including dynamic panel addition and layout management. This package is a valuable tool for developers looking to create responsive and customizable user interfaces in their Flutter applications.
