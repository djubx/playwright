This package is particularly useful for applications that require a more immersive experience, such as settings menus, additional options, or contextual information.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `modal_side_sheet` package in scenarios such as:
- Displaying a settings menu that users can access without leaving the current screen.
- Providing additional context or options related to a specific item in a list.
- Creating a more engaging user experience by allowing users to interact with content in a non-intrusive way.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily customize the appearance of the side sheet to match your app's theme.
- **Flexible Content**: The package allows you to include any widget as content, making it versatile for various use cases.
- **Easy Integration**: The package is straightforward to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Modal Side Sheet Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `modal_side_sheet` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  modal_side_sheet: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/modal_side_sheet).

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:modal_side_sheet/modal_side_sheet.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Modal Side Sheet

You can use the `showModalSideSheet` function to display the side sheet. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
void _showSideSheet(BuildContext context) {
  showModalSideSheet(
    context: context,
    builder: (context) {
      return Container(
        height: 300,
        color: Colors.white,
        child: Center(
          child: Text('This is a modal side sheet!'),
        ),
      );
    },
  );
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the correct configurations. Typically, no additional configurations are needed for the modal side sheet to work.

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your app supports the latest iOS versions. You may need to adjust the `Info.plist` file for any specific permissions or configurations related to your app's functionality.

## Step 4: Optimizations

To enhance performance, consider the following:
- Use lightweight widgets within the side sheet to ensure smooth animations.
- Avoid heavy computations in the UI thread when the side sheet is displayed.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `modal_side_sheet` package into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Using Modal Side Sheet

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:modal_side_sheet/modal_side_sheet.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Modal Side Sheet Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Modal Side Sheet Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () => _showSideSheet(context), // Show side sheet on button press
            child: Text('Show Side Sheet'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to display the modal side sheet
  void _showSideSheet(BuildContext context) {
    showModalSideSheet(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return Container(
          height: 300, // Set the height of the side sheet
          color: Colors.white, // Background color of the side sheet
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('This is a modal side sheet!', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20)),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the side sheet
                },
                child: Text('Close'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. In the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is displayed. When pressed, it triggers the _showSideSheet function.
// 4. The _showSideSheet function calls showModalSideSheet, which displays a side sheet with a specified height and background color.
// 5. Inside the side sheet, a message and a button to close the sheet are displayed.
// 6. Pressing the 'Close' button pops the side sheet off the navigation stack, returning the user to the main screen.
```
