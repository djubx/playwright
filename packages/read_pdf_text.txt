# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `read_pdf_text` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `read_pdf_text` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  read_pdf_text: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/read_pdf_text).

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

#### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your photo library to select PDF files.</string>
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your microphone for audio features.</string>
   ```

### Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:read_pdf_text/read_pdf_text.dart';
```

## Using the Package

Once the package is set up, you can start using it to read PDF files. Below is a simple example of how to implement it in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:read_pdf_text/read_pdf_text.dart';
import 'package:file_picker/file_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'PDF Text Reader',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: PDFReaderScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class PDFReaderScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PDFReaderScreenState createState() => _PDFReaderScreenState();
}

class _PDFReaderScreenState extends State<PDFReaderScreen> {
  String _pdfText = "Select a PDF file to read text.";
  
  // Function to pick a PDF file
  Future<void> _pickPDF() async {
    // Use file_picker to select a PDF file
    FilePickerResult? result = await FilePicker.platform.pickFiles(
      type: FileType.custom,
      allowedExtensions: ['pdf'],
    );

    // Check if a file was selected
    if (result != null) {
      // Get the file path
      String filePath = result.files.single.path!;
      
      // Read the PDF text using read_pdf_text package
      String pdfText = await ReadPdfText.readPdf(filePath);
      
      // Update the state with the extracted text
      setState(() {
        _pdfText = pdfText;
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('PDF Text Reader'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the extracted PDF text
            Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
              child: Text(
                _pdfText,
                textAlign: TextAlign.center,
              ),
            ),
            // Button to pick a PDF file
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickPDF,
              child: Text('Pick PDF File'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to PDFReaderScreen, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In PDFReaderScreen, the state is managed by _PDFReaderScreenState.
// 5. The initial state contains a message prompting the user to select a PDF file.
// 6. The _pickPDF function is triggered when the user presses the button.
// 7. The file_picker package is used to open a file picker dialog for selecting a PDF file.
// 8. If a file is selected, its path is retrieved, and the read_pdf_text package is used to extract text from the PDF.
// 9. The extracted text is then displayed on the screen, updating the UI accordingly.
```
