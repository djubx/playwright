   await onedrive.authenticate();
   ```

3. **Upload a File**:
   ```dart
   await onedrive.uploadFile(filePath: 'path/to/file.txt', folderId: 'folder_id');

# Complete Example of flutter_onedrive

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_onedrive/flutter_onedrive.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'OneDrive Example',
      home: OneDriveHome(),
    );
  }
}

class OneDriveHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _OneDriveHomeState createState() => _OneDriveHomeState();
}

class _OneDriveHomeState extends State<OneDriveHome> {
  final OneDrive onedrive = OneDrive();
  List<File> files = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _authenticateAndFetchFiles();
  }

  // Authenticate the user and fetch files from OneDrive
  Future<void> _authenticateAndFetchFiles() async {
    await onedrive.authenticate(); // Authenticate the user
    _fetchFiles(); // Fetch files after authentication
  }

  // Fetch files from a specific folder
  Future<void> _fetchFiles() async {
    final fetchedFiles = await onedrive.listFiles(folderId: 'your_folder_id'); // List files
    setState(() {
      files = fetchedFiles; // Update the state with fetched files
    });
  }

  // Upload a file to OneDrive
  Future<void> _uploadFile() async {
    await onedrive.uploadFile(filePath: 'path/to/file.txt', folderId: 'your_folder_id'); // Upload file
    _fetchFiles(); // Refresh the file list after upload
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('OneDrive Files'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.upload_file),
            onPressed: _uploadFile, // Trigger file upload
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: files.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(files[index].name), // Display file name
            onTap: () {
              // Handle file tap (e.g., download or view)
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The OneDriveHome widget is created, which manages the state of the OneDrive integration.
// 3. In the initState method, the app authenticates the user and fetches files from OneDrive.
// 4. The _fetchFiles method retrieves the list of files from a specified folder and updates the UI.
// 5. The app displays a list of files, and users can upload a file by tapping the upload icon in the app bar.
// 6. After uploading, the file list is refreshed to show the newly uploaded file.
