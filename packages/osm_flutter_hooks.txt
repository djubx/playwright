# osm_flutter_hooks Package Overview
=====================================

The `osm_flutter_hooks` package is a powerful tool for working with OpenStreetMap (OSM) data in Flutter applications. It provides a set of hooks and utilities for easily integrating OSM data into your app, allowing you to create complex and interactive maps with ease.

When to Use This Package
------------------------

This package is ideal for any Flutter application that requires working with OSM data, such as:

* Map-based applications (e.g., navigation, tracking, etc.)
* Location-based services (e.g., finding nearby points of interest)
* Geographic information systems (GIS)

Key Features
------------

* Easy integration with OSM data
* Support for various map tile providers (e.g., OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, etc.)
* Customizable map styles and overlays
* Support for markers, polygons, and other geographic features

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
```

#### iOS

* Add the following lines to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to your location to work properly</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to your location to work properly</string>
```

### Configurations and Optimizations

* You can customize the map style and overlays using the `OSMFlutterHooks` instance.
* You can also optimize the map rendering by using the `OSMFlutterHooks` instance to set the map tile provider and other settings.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:osm_flutter_hooks/osm_flutter_hooks.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  OSMFlutterHooks _osmFlutterHooks = OSMFlutterHooks();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _osmFlutterHooks.init();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('OSM Flutter Hooks Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: OSMFlutterHooksMap(
          osmFlutterHooks: _osmFlutterHooks,
          mapTileProvider: MapTileProvider.openStreetMap(),
          markers: [
            Marker(
              point: LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194),
              builder: (ctx) => Icon(Icons.place),
            ),
          ],
          polygons: [
            Polygon(
              points: [
                LatLng(37.7749, -122.4194),
                LatLng(37.7859, -122.4364),
                LatLng(37.7963, -122.4574),
                LatLng(37.8067, -122.4784),
              ],
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The RealFlutter widget is created and initialized.
// 2. The OSMFlutterHooks instance is created and initialized.
// 3. The OSMFlutterHooksMap widget is created and displayed.
// 4. The map tile provider is set to OpenStreetMap.
// 5. A marker is added to the map at a specific location.
// 6. A polygon is added to the map with a specific set of points.
// 7. The map is displayed with the marker and polygon.

// Final summary: This code creates a Flutter application that displays an OpenStreetMap map with a marker and polygon. The map is customizable and can be optimized for performance.
