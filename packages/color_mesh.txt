<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Color Mesh Flutter Package

The **color_mesh** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed for developers who want to create visually appealing applications with dynamic color schemes. This package allows you to generate and manipulate color meshes, enabling smooth transitions and gradients that can enhance the user experience.

## When to Use Color Mesh

You might consider using the **color_mesh** package in scenarios such as:
- Creating custom themes for your application that change dynamically based on user preferences or time of day.
- Implementing visually rich backgrounds that require smooth color transitions.
- Designing interactive UI elements that respond to user actions with color changes.

## Features

- **Dynamic Color Generation**: Create color meshes that can change based on user input or application state.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Easily implement smooth transitions between colors, enhancing the visual appeal of your app.
- **Customizable**: Adjust the parameters of the color mesh to fit your design needs.

With these features, the **color_mesh** package can significantly improve the aesthetic quality of your Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Color Mesh

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **color_mesh** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  color_mesh: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:color_mesh/color_mesh.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Color Mesh

You can now use the **color_mesh** package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a color mesh and apply it to a widget.

```dart
// Example of using Color Mesh in a Flutter widget
ColorMesh colorMesh = ColorMesh(
  colors: [Colors.red, Colors.blue, Colors.green],
  meshSize: 5,
);
```

This code snippet creates a color mesh with three colors and a specified mesh size.

With these steps, you are now ready to implement the **color_mesh** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Color Mesh in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:color_mesh/color_mesh.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Color Mesh Example',
      home: ColorMeshDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class ColorMeshDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ColorMeshDemoState createState() => _ColorMeshDemoState();
}

class _ColorMeshDemoState extends State<ColorMeshDemo> {
  // Create a ColorMesh instance with a gradient of colors
  ColorMesh colorMesh = ColorMesh(
    colors: [Colors.red, Colors.blue, Colors.green],
    meshSize: 10, // Define the size of the mesh
  );

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Color Mesh Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Use a Container to display the color mesh
        child: Container(
          width: 300,
          height: 300,
          decoration: BoxDecoration(
            gradient: LinearGradient(
              colors: colorMesh.getColors(), // Get colors from the mesh
              begin: Alignment.topLeft,
              end: Alignment.bottomRight,
            ),
          ),
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'Color Mesh Example',
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp.
// 3. ColorMeshDemo is a StatefulWidget that manages the state of the color mesh.
// 4. In the build method of ColorMeshDemo, a ColorMesh instance is created with a gradient of colors.
// 5. A Scaffold is used to provide the app structure, with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. The Container widget displays the color mesh as a background gradient.
// 7. The text "Color Mesh Example" is centered within the container, showcasing the color mesh effect.
