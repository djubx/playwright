In summary, the code flows as follows:

1. The user runs the app and sees a red square on the screen.
2. The user presses the floating action button to increment the size of the square.
3. The `onSizeChanged` callback function is called with the new size of the square.
4. The `onSizeChanged` callback function updates the state of the widget with the new size.
5. The widget is rebuilt with the new size.
6. The user sees the updated square on the screen.
7. Steps 2-6 repeat as the user continues to press the floating action button.

The `ResizeObserver` widget is used to observe changes in the size of the square.
The `onSizeChanged` callback function is used to handle changes in the size of the square.
The `setState` function is used to update the state of the widget with the new size.
