# flutter_resize_observer: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_resize_observer` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who need to monitor and respond to changes in widget sizes. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where dynamic layouts are required, such as responsive designs, animations, or when dealing with complex UI elements that may change size based on user interactions or device orientation.

## When to Use This Package
- **Responsive Layouts**: When building applications that need to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Dynamic Content**: For applications that display content that can change size, such as images or text that may be loaded asynchronously.
- **Animations**: When you want to trigger animations based on size changes of specific widgets.

## Key Features
- **Size Monitoring**: Observes changes in the size of widgets and provides callbacks to handle these changes.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that can be easily integrated into existing Flutter applications.
- **Performance**: Efficiently tracks size changes without significant performance overhead.

Overall, `flutter_resize_observer` is an essential package for developers looking to create adaptive and responsive Flutter applications.

# flutter_resize_observer: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_resize_observer` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_resize_observer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_resize_observer).

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 9.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_resize_observer`, you can wrap any widget with the `ResizeObserver` widget. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_resize_observer/flutter_resize_observer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Resize Observer Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ResizeObserver(
            onResize: (size) {
              // Handle size change
              print('New size: $size');
            },
            child: Container(
              width: 200,
              height: 200,
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ResizeObserver` widget wraps a `Container`. Whenever the size of the `Container` changes, the `onResize` callback is triggered, allowing you to handle the size change accordingly.

# Complete Example of flutter_resize_observer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_resize_observer/flutter_resize_observer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the size of the observed widget
  Size _size = Size.zero;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Resize Observer Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ResizeObserver(
            onResize: (size) {
              // Update the size variable when the widget resizes
              setState(() {
                _size = size;
              });
            },
            child: Container(
              // The size of the container can be changed dynamically
              width: 200,
              height: 200,
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Size: ${_size.width.toStringAsFixed(2)} x ${_size.height.toStringAsFixed(2)}',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 3. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 4. The ResizeObserver wraps a Container, allowing it to monitor size changes.
// 5. When the size of the Container changes, the onResize callback is triggered.
// 6. The new size is captured and stored in the _size variable using setState.
// 7. The Container displays its current size in the center, updating dynamically as it resizes.
```
