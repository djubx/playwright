# Flurry Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The Flurry package for Flutter is a powerful tool designed for integrating Flurry Analytics into your Flutter applications. Flurry Analytics provides insights into user behavior, allowing developers to track app usage, user engagement, and retention metrics. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to enhance their app's performance through data-driven decisions.

## When to Use Flurry
- **User Engagement Tracking**: If you want to understand how users interact with your app, Flurry can help you track events and user sessions.
- **Retention Analysis**: Flurry provides insights into user retention, helping you identify how often users return to your app.
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor app performance metrics to optimize user experience.

## Key Features
- **Event Tracking**: Log custom events to understand user interactions.
- **User Segmentation**: Analyze user behavior based on demographics and usage patterns.
- **Session Tracking**: Automatically track user sessions to measure engagement.
- **Crash Reporting**: Get insights into app crashes and performance issues.

With these features, Flurry is an excellent choice for developers looking to leverage analytics in their Flutter applications.

# Setting Up Flurry in Your Flutter Project

Integrating the Flurry package into your Flutter application involves a few steps, including installation and platform-specific configurations.

## Installation

To add the Flurry package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flurry: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. **Add Permissions**: Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **Initialize Flurry**: In your `MainActivity.java` or `MainActivity.kt`, initialize Flurry in the `onCreate` method:

   ```java
   import com.flurry.android.FlurryAgent;

   @Override
   public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
       FlurryAgent.init(this, "YOUR_API_KEY");
   }
   ```

### iOS Configuration
1. **Add Permissions**: Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. **Initialize Flurry**: In your `AppDelegate.swift`, initialize Flurry in the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method:

   ```swift
   import Flurry_iOS_SDK

   @UIApplicationMain
   class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
       func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
           Flurry.startSession("YOUR_API_KEY")
           return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
       }
   }
   ```

## Optimizations
- Ensure you replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual Flurry API key.
- Test the integration on both Android and iOS devices to ensure proper functionality.

With these steps completed, your Flutter application is now set up to use Flurry Analytics.

# Complete Example of Flurry Integration in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flurry/flurry.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flurry Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Flurry Analytics
    Flurry.init("YOUR_API_KEY");
  }

  void _logEvent() {
    // Log a custom event when the button is pressed
    Flurry.logEvent("Button Pressed");
    // Show a snackbar to confirm the event logging
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(content: Text('Event Logged: Button Pressed')),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flurry Analytics Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _logEvent, // Call the log event function
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// The HomeScreen is a StatefulWidget that initializes Flurry Analytics in its initState method.
// When the user presses the button, the _logEvent method is called, which logs a custom event to Flurry.
// A snackbar is displayed to confirm that the event has been logged successfully.
// The UI consists of a simple button that triggers the event logging when pressed.
```
