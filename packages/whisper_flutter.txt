# Whisper Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **whisper_flutter** package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers who want to integrate voice communication features into their applications. This package leverages the Whisper AI model to provide high-quality speech recognition and synthesis capabilities, making it ideal for applications that require voice interaction, such as virtual assistants, voice-controlled apps, and more.

## When to Use Whisper Flutter
- **Voice Assistants**: If you're building an app that requires voice commands or responses, this package can help you implement those features seamlessly.
- **Accessibility**: Enhance your app's accessibility by allowing users to interact with it using their voice.
- **Interactive Games**: Create engaging experiences in games where players can use voice commands to control characters or actions.

## Key Features
- **Speech Recognition**: Convert spoken language into text with high accuracy.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Generate natural-sounding speech from text, allowing your app to "speak" to users.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports various languages, making it suitable for a global audience.
- **Customizable Voice Options**: Choose from different voice profiles to match your app's personality.

With these features, the whisper_flutter package stands out as a versatile solution for integrating voice capabilities into Flutter applications.

# Whisper Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the whisper_flutter package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  whisper_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/whisper_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for voice recognition.</string>
<key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to speech recognition for voice commands.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the whisper_flutter package, you will typically create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and call its methods for speech recognition and text-to-speech functionalities.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and use the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:whisper_flutter/whisper_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _recognizedText = '';
  final WhisperFlutter _whisper = WhisperFlutter();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _whisper.initialize();
  }

  void _startListening() async {
    _whisper.startListening((text) {
      setState(() {
        _recognizedText = text;
      });
    });
  }

  void _speak(String text) {
    _whisper.speak(text);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Whisper Flutter Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Recognized Text: $_recognizedText'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startListening,
              child: Text('Start Listening'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _speak('Hello, how can I assist you?'),
              child: Text('Speak'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the `WhisperFlutter` instance, start listening for voice input, and provide a button to speak a predefined text.

# Complete Example of Whisper Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:whisper_flutter/whisper_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _recognizedText = ''; // Variable to hold recognized text
  final WhisperFlutter _whisper = WhisperFlutter(); // Instance of WhisperFlutter

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _whisper.initialize(); // Initialize the whisper package
  }

  // Method to start listening for voice input
  void _startListening() async {
    _whisper.startListening((text) {
      setState(() {
        _recognizedText = text; // Update recognized text
      });
    });
  }

  // Method to convert text to speech
  void _speak(String text) {
    _whisper.speak(text); // Speak the provided text
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Whisper Flutter Example')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Recognized Text: $_recognizedText'), // Display recognized text
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startListening, // Start listening button
              child: Text('Start Listening'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _speak('Hello, how can I assist you?'), // Speak button
              child: Text('Speak'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The app initializes the WhisperFlutter instance when the state is created.
// 2. When the "Start Listening" button is pressed, the app starts listening for voice input.
// 3. The recognized text is updated in the UI as the user speaks.
// 4. When the "Speak" button is pressed, the app converts the provided text into speech.
// 5. The recognized text and the ability to speak back to the user create an interactive experience.
