# Neumorphic Button Flutter Package

The **neumorphic_button** Flutter package is a UI toolkit that allows developers to create neumorphic buttons, which are characterized by their soft, inset, and extruded appearance. This design style mimics the look of physical buttons, providing a modern and visually appealing interface. Neumorphism is particularly popular in mobile applications, as it enhances user experience by creating a sense of depth and interaction.

## When to Use

You should consider using the neumorphic_button package when:
- You want to create a modern, soft UI that stands out.
- Your application requires buttons that provide a tactile feel without being overly aggressive in design.
- You are targeting platforms where a subtle, elegant design is preferred, such as lifestyle, health, or productivity apps.

## Features

- **Customizable Styles**: You can easily customize the button's color, shape, and shadow to fit your app's theme.
- **Responsive Feedback**: The buttons provide visual feedback on interaction, enhancing user experience.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

Overall, the neumorphic_button package is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement a modern design aesthetic in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Neumorphic Button Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the neumorphic_button package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  neumorphic_button: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Neumorphic Button

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using the neumorphic button in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:neumorphic_button/neumorphic_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Neumorphic Button Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: NeumorphicButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Neumorphic Button Pressed!');
            },
            style: NeumorphicStyle(
              depth: 8, // Depth of the button
              color: Colors.grey[300], // Background color
              shape: NeumorphicShape.convex, // Button shape
            ),
            child: Text('Press Me', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20)),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

This code creates a simple Flutter application with a neumorphic button in the center of the screen. When pressed, it prints a message to the console.

# Complete Example of Neumorphic Button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:neumorphic_button/neumorphic_button.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Neumorphic Button Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: NeumorphicButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Action to perform on button press
              print('Neumorphic Button Pressed!');
            },
            style: NeumorphicStyle(
              depth: 8, // Depth of the button
              color: Colors.grey[300], // Background color
              shape: NeumorphicShape.convex, // Button shape
            ),
            child: Text('Press Me', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20)),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. The Center widget holds a NeumorphicButton.
// 6. The NeumorphicButton has an onPressed callback that prints a message when pressed.
// 7. The button's style is defined using NeumorphicStyle, which includes depth, color, and shape.
// 8. Finally, the application is run using runApp, displaying the UI to the user.
