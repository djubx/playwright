# Tutorial: Setting Up Syncfusion Localizations

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `syncfusion_localizations` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `syncfusion_localizations` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  syncfusion_localizations: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Configuring Localization

### Android Configuration

1. Open the `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file.
2. Ensure that the `android:configChanges` attribute includes `locale`:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:launchMode="singleTop"
    android:theme="@style/LaunchTheme"
    android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|smallestScreenSize|locale|layoutDirection|fontScale|screenLayout|direction|uiMode"
    android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
    android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following key to support localization:

```xml
<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
<array>
    <string>en</string>
    <string>es</string>
    <string>fr</string>
    <!-- Add other languages as needed -->
</array>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `syncfusion_localizations` package, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Here’s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:syncfusion_localizations/syncfusion_localizations.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      localizationsDelegates: [
        GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,
        SfLocalizations.delegate, // Add Syncfusion localization delegate
      ],
      supportedLocales: [
        const Locale('en', ''), // English
        const Locale('es', ''), // Spanish
        const Locale('fr', ''), // French
        // Add other supported locales
      ],
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}
```

In this setup:
- We import the necessary localization packages.
- We define the supported locales and add the Syncfusion localization delegate to the `localizationsDelegates` list.

Now, your application is ready to support multiple languages using the `syncfusion_localizations` package!

# Complete Example of Syncfusion Localizations

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `syncfusion_localizations` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:syncfusion_localizations/syncfusion_localizations.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Syncfusion Localizations Demo',
      localizationsDelegates: [
        GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,
        SfLocalizations.delegate, // Syncfusion localization delegate
      ],
      supportedLocales: [
        const Locale('en', ''), // English
        const Locale('es', ''), // Spanish
        const Locale('fr', ''), // French
      ],
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(SfLocalizations.of(context).getString('appBarTitle')),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(SfLocalizations.of(context).getString('welcomeMessage')),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action for button press
              },
              child: Text(SfLocalizations.of(context).getString('buttonLabel')),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with localization delegates and supported locales.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. In RealFlutter, the AppBar displays a localized title using SfLocalizations.
// 5. The body contains a welcome message and a button, both of which are localized.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it can trigger any action defined in the onPressed callback.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example:
- The `MyApp` class initializes the localization settings and defines the supported languages.
- The `RealFlutter` class builds the main UI, utilizing localized strings for the AppBar title and button label.
- The comments within the code explain the flow of the application step-by-step, making it easy to understand how localization is integrated.

## Summary

The `syncfusion_localizations` package provides a straightforward way to implement localization in Flutter applications that use Syncfusion widgets. By following the setup and usage instructions, developers can create applications that cater to a global audience, enhancing user experience and accessibility.
