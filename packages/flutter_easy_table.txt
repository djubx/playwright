   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_easy_table/flutter_easy_table.dart';
   ```

2. Create a simple table in your widget tree:
   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Table Example')),
         body: EasyTable(
           columns: [
             TableColumn(label: 'Name'),
             TableColumn(label: 'Age'),
             TableColumn(label: 'Occupation'),
           ],
           rows: [
             TableRow(cells: ['Alice', '30', 'Engineer']),
             TableRow(cells: ['Bob', '25', 'Designer']),
             TableRow(cells: ['Charlie', '35', 'Teacher']),
           ],
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

This code sets up a basic table with three columns and three rows of data. You can expand upon this by adding sorting and filtering functionalities as needed.
