# Setting Up the Package
To use the `flutter_onboarding` package, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_onboarding: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_onboarding/flutter_onboarding.dart';
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The package works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to configure the AndroidManifest.xml file to handle the onboarding screen's full-screen mode.

For Android, add the following code to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<application
    ...
    android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.NoActionBar">
    ...
</application>
```
For iOS, no additional configuration is required.

## Using the Package
To create an onboarding experience, create a new instance of the `Onboarding` widget and pass in the required parameters:
```dart
Onboarding(
  pages: [
    OnboardingPage(
      title: 'Welcome to RealFlutter',
      description: 'This is the first onboarding screen',
      image: Image.asset('assets/image1.png'),
    ),
    OnboardingPage(
      title: 'Feature 1',
      description: 'This is the second onboarding screen',
      image: Image.asset('assets/image2.png'),
    ),
  ],
  skipButton: Text('Skip'),
  doneButton: Text('Done'),
)
```

      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to the home screen'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow:
// 1. The user launches the app and is presented with the onboarding screen.
// 2. The user can swipe through the onboarding screens to view the features of the app.
// 3. The user can skip the onboarding process by pressing the skip button.
// 4. The user can complete the onboarding process by pressing the done button.
// 5. Once the onboarding process is complete, the user is navigated to the home screen.

// Summary:
// The code creates an onboarding experience with three screens, each showcasing a feature of the app.
// The user can skip or complete the onboarding process, and is navigated to the home screen accordingly.
