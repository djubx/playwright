# Tutorial: Setting Up the Thermal Printer Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **thermal_printer** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **thermal_printer** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  thermal_printer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/thermal_printer).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

2. **Bluetooth Settings**: Ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on the device.

### iOS

1. **Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for Bluetooth usage:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to thermal printers.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires Bluetooth access to connect to thermal printers.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. **Import the Package**:

```dart
import 'package:thermal_printer/thermal_printer.dart';
```

2. **Initialize the Printer**:

You can initialize the printer and connect to it using the following code:

```dart
final printer = ThermalPrinter();
```

3. **Print a Sample Receipt**:

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to print a receipt:

```dart
await printer.connect('printer_address'); // Replace with your printer's address
await printer.printCustom('Hello World', 2); // Print custom text
await printer.disconnect();
```

This code connects to the printer, prints "Hello World" with a size of 2, and then disconnects.

## Step 4: Testing

Make sure to test your application on a physical device, as emulators do not support Bluetooth printing.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the **thermal_printer** package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Using the Thermal Printer Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:thermal_printer/thermal_printer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Thermal Printer Example',
      home: PrinterPage(),
    );
  }
}

class PrinterPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PrinterPageState createState() => _PrinterPageState();
}

class _PrinterPageState extends State<PrinterPage> {
  final ThermalPrinter printer = ThermalPrinter();
  String printerStatus = 'Disconnected';

  // Function to connect to the printer
  void connectToPrinter(String address) async {
    try {
      await printer.connect(address);
      setState(() {
        printerStatus = 'Connected';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        printerStatus = 'Error connecting to printer';
      });
    }
  }

  // Function to print a sample receipt
  void printReceipt() async {
    if (printerStatus == 'Connected') {
      await printer.printCustom('Receipt Title', 2);
      await printer.printCustom('Item 1: \$10.00', 1);
      await printer.printCustom('Item 2: \$15.00', 1);
      await printer.printCustom('Total: \$25.00', 2);
      await printer.disconnect();
      setState(() {
        printerStatus = 'Disconnected';
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        printerStatus = 'Please connect to a printer first';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Thermal Printer Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Printer Status: $printerStatus'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => connectToPrinter('printer_address'), // Replace with your printer's address
              child: Text('Connect to Printer'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: printReceipt,
              child: Text('Print Receipt'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The PrinterPage widget is displayed, showing the current printer status.
// 3. The user can connect to a printer by pressing the "Connect to Printer" button.
// 4. Once connected, the user can print a sample receipt by pressing the "Print Receipt" button.
// 5. The app updates the printer status based on the connection and printing actions.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that connects to a thermal printer and prints a sample receipt. The application flow is straightforward:
- The user can connect to a printer by providing its address.
- After a successful connection, the user can print a receipt with predefined items.
- The application updates the printer status accordingly, providing feedback to the user.

This example demonstrates the key features of the **thermal_printer** package and how to integrate it into a Flutter application effectively.
