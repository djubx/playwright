// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user enters a JWT in the text field.
// 2. The user clicks the "Decode JWT" button.
// 3. The `_decodeJwt` function is called, which attempts to decode the JWT using the `JsonWebToken.decode` method.
// 4. If the JWT is successfully decoded, the decoded claims are printed to the console and displayed on the screen.
// 5. If an error occurs during decoding, an error message is printed to the console.

// In summary, this code demonstrates how to use the `jsonwebtoken_decode` package to decode a JWT and extract its claims. The user can enter a JWT in the text field, click the "Decode JWT" button, and view the decoded claims on the screen.
