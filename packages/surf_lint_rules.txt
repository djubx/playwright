# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Surf Lint Rules

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **surf_lint_rules** package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter project.

## Step 1: Adding the Package to Your Project

To get started, you need to add the **surf_lint_rules** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  surf_lint_rules: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Running Flutter Pub Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Configuring Linting Rules

Next, you need to create a configuration file for the linting rules. Create a file named `analysis_options.yaml` in the root of your Flutter project and add the following content:

```yaml
include: package:surf_lint_rules/analysis_options.yaml
```

This line includes the default linting rules provided by the **surf_lint_rules** package.

## Step 4: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Android

Ensure that your Android project is set up to use Kotlin and that you have the necessary Gradle configurations. You can check your `android/build.gradle` file for the following:

```groovy
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.5.31'
    dependencies {
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
}
```

### For iOS

For iOS, ensure that your project is using the latest version of Swift. You can check your `ios/Podfile` for the following:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 5: Running the Linter

To run the linter, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

This command will analyze your code and provide feedback based on the linting rules defined in your `analysis_options.yaml` file.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can successfully set up and use the **surf_lint_rules** package in your Flutter project. This will help you maintain high code quality and consistency across your application.

# Complete Example: Using Surf Lint Rules in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// The main widget of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Surf Lint Rules Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// Home page widget
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Surf Lint Rules Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to Surf Lint Rules!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action when button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (BuildContext context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Hello!'),
                      content: Text('This is a demo of surf_lint_rules.'),
                      actions: <Widget>[
                        TextButton(
                          child: Text('Close'),
                          onPressed: () {
                            Navigator.of(context).pop();
                          },
                        ),
                      ],
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Show Message'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, setting the title and theme for the app.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to MyHomePage, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. MyHomePage builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget containing a Column.
// 5. The Column has a Text widget displaying a welcome message and an ElevatedButton.
// 6. When the button is pressed, it triggers a dialog to show a message, demonstrating interactivity.
// 7. The dialog can be closed by pressing the 'Close' button, which pops the dialog off the navigation stack.
```
