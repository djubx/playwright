# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using aws_s3_upload_lite

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `aws_s3_upload_lite` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `aws_s3_upload_lite` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  aws_s3_upload_lite: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the current version of the package.

## Step 2: Configure AWS Credentials

### For Android

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
    }
}
```

2. Add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### For iOS

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to upload images.</string>
```

2. Ensure you have the correct deployment target set in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Package

In your Dart code, import the package and initialize it with your AWS credentials:

```dart
import 'package:aws_s3_upload_lite/aws_s3_upload_lite.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize AWS S3 with your credentials
  final s3 = RealFlutter(
    region: 'your-region', // e.g., 'us-east-1'
    bucketId: 'your-bucket-id',
    accessKey: 'your-access-key',
    secretKey: 'your-secret-key',
  );
}
```

## Step 4: Uploading Files

You can now use the `uploadFile` method to upload files to your S3 bucket. Hereâ€™s an example of how to do this:

```dart
Future<void> uploadFile(String filePath) async {
  try {
    // Call the upload method
    final result = await s3.uploadFile(filePath);
    print('File uploaded successfully: $result');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error uploading file: $e');
  }
}
```

This method takes the file path as an argument and uploads the file to your specified S3 bucket.

# Complete Example of Using aws_s3_upload_lite

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:aws_s3_upload_lite/aws_s3_upload_lite.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'AWS S3 Upload Example',
      home: UploadPage(),
    );
  }
}

class UploadPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _UploadPageState createState() => _UploadPageState();
}

class _UploadPageState extends State<UploadPage> {
  final RealFlutter s3 = RealFlutter(
    region: 'your-region', // e.g., 'us-east-1'
    bucketId: 'your-bucket-id',
    accessKey: 'your-access-key',
    secretKey: 'your-secret-key',
  );

  // Function to handle file upload
  Future<void> uploadFile(String filePath) async {
    try {
      // Call the upload method
      final result = await s3.uploadFile(filePath);
      print('File uploaded successfully: $result');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error uploading file: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Upload to S3'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Replace with the actual file path you want to upload
            String filePath = '/path/to/your/file.jpg';
            uploadFile(filePath);
          },
          child: Text('Upload File'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The UploadPage widget is displayed, containing a button to trigger the upload.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the uploadFile function is called with the specified file path.
// 4. The uploadFile function attempts to upload the file to S3 and handles any errors that may occur.
// 5. Upon successful upload, a success message is printed; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that allows users to upload a file to AWS S3. The application initializes the `aws_s3_upload_lite` package with the necessary AWS credentials and provides a button to trigger the file upload. The flow of the application is straightforward, focusing on user interaction and error handling during the upload process.
