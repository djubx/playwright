# Overview of the `web_socket_client` Flutter Package

The `web_socket_client` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement WebSocket communication in their applications. WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, making them ideal for real-time applications such as chat apps, live notifications, and collaborative tools.

## When to Use `web_socket_client`

You should consider using the `web_socket_client` package when:
- You need real-time data updates, such as in chat applications or live sports scores.
- Your application requires low-latency communication, which is essential for gaming or financial trading apps.
- You want to maintain a persistent connection to a server for continuous data exchange.

## Key Features
- **Easy Integration**: The package is straightforward to integrate into any Flutter application.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Event Handling**: Provides simple methods to handle connection events, messages, and errors.
- **Customizable**: Allows for customization of connection parameters and message formats.

In summary, the `web_socket_client` package is an essential tool for Flutter developers aiming to build responsive and interactive applications that require real-time communication.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `web_socket_client`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `web_socket_client` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  web_socket_client: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions for internet access. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you may need to configure your app's `Info.plist` file to allow arbitrary loads if you are connecting to a non-secure WebSocket server. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to connect to a WebSocket server, send messages, and listen for incoming messages.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:web_socket_client/web_socket_client.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the WebSocket client and connect to a server:

```dart
final WebSocketClient client = WebSocketClient('ws://your-websocket-url');
```

3. Listen for messages and handle connection events:

```dart
client.onMessage.listen((message) {
  print('Received message: $message');
});

client.onError.listen((error) {
  print('Error occurred: $error');
});

client.onDone.listen((_) {
  print('Connection closed');
});
```

4. Send messages to the server:

```dart
client.send('Hello, WebSocket!');
```

With these steps, you can successfully set up and use the `web_socket_client` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using `web_socket_client`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:web_socket_client/web_socket_client.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late WebSocketClient client; // Declare the WebSocket client
  String receivedMessage = ''; // Variable to store received messages

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the WebSocket client and connect to the server
    client = WebSocketClient('ws://your-websocket-url');
    
    // Listen for incoming messages
    client.onMessage.listen((message) {
      setState(() {
        receivedMessage = message; // Update the state with the received message
      });
    });

    // Handle errors
    client.onError.listen((error) {
      print('Error occurred: $error');
    });

    // Handle connection closure
    client.onDone.listen((_) {
      print('Connection closed');
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    client.close(); // Close the WebSocket connection when the widget is disposed
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('WebSocket Client Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text('Received Message:'),
              Text(receivedMessage), // Display the received message
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  client.send('Hello, WebSocket!'); // Send a message to the server
                },
                child: Text('Send Message'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code demonstrates a simple Flutter application using the `web_socket_client` package.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app and sets `RealFlutter` as the home widget.
// 2. In the `RealFlutter` stateful widget, we create a WebSocket client and connect to a specified URL.
// 3. We listen for incoming messages and update the UI accordingly.
// 4. The `dispose` method ensures that the WebSocket connection is closed when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
// 5. The UI consists of a text display for received messages and a button to send a message to the server.
// 6. When the button is pressed, a message is sent to the WebSocket server, and any incoming messages are displayed in real-time.
