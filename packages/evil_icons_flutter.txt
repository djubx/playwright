## Usage
Once the package is installed, you can start using the icons in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

### Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package:

```

### Using Icons
You can use the icons in your widgets like this:

Icon(EvilIcons.heart, size: 30.0, color: Colors.red);
```

### Platform-Specific Details

# Complete Example of Evil Icons Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:evil_icons_flutter/evil_icons_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Evil Icons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Evil Icons Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a heart icon
              Icon(EvilIcons.heart, size: 50.0, color: Colors.red),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a star icon
              Icon(EvilIcons.star, size: 50.0, color: Colors.yellow),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a trash icon
              Icon(EvilIcons.trash, size: 50.0, color: Colors.grey),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Evil Icons Flutter'.
// The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// A Column widget is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// Three icons are displayed: a heart, a star, and a trash icon, each with specified sizes and colors.
// SizedBox widgets are used to add space between the icons for better visual separation.
// This simple application demonstrates how to use the evil_icons_flutter package effectively.
