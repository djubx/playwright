# mcumgr_flutter: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `mcumgr_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add `mcumgr_flutter` to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  mcumgr_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/mcumgr_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `mcumgr_flutter` package, you will typically follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Connection**: Establish a connection to the device.
2. **Perform Operations**: Use the provided methods to update firmware, configure settings, or monitor status.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and use the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mcumgr_flutter/mcumgr_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late McumgrFlutter mcumgr;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    mcumgr = McumgrFlutter();
    // Initialize the connection to the device
    mcumgr.connect('device_address');
  }

  // Method to update firmware
  void updateFirmware() async {
    await mcumgr.updateFirmware('firmware_file.bin');
  }

  // Method to get device status
  void getDeviceStatus() async {
    var status = await mcumgr.getStatus();
    print('Device Status: $status');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('MCU Manager Flutter')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: updateFirmware,
              child: Text('Update Firmware'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: getDeviceStatus,
              child: Text('Get Device Status'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the `mcumgr` instance and connect to a device. We also provide buttons to update firmware and retrieve device status.

# Complete Example of mcumgr_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mcumgr_flutter/mcumgr_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late McumgrFlutter mcumgr; // Declare the mcumgr instance

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    mcumgr = McumgrFlutter(); // Initialize the mcumgr instance
    mcumgr.connect('device_address'); // Connect to the device
  }

  // Method to update firmware
  void updateFirmware() async {
    // Call the updateFirmware method with the firmware file
    await mcumgr.updateFirmware('firmware_file.bin');
  }

  // Method to get device status
  void getDeviceStatus() async {
    // Retrieve the device status
    var status = await mcumgr.getStatus();
    print('Device Status: $status'); // Print the status to the console
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('MCU Manager Flutter')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: updateFirmware, // Button to update firmware
              child: Text('Update Firmware'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: getDeviceStatus, // Button to get device status
              child: Text('Get Device Status'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. In the initState method, we initialize the mcumgr instance and connect to the device using its address.
// 3. The build method creates a simple UI with two buttons: one for updating firmware and another for getting device status.
// 4. When the "Update Firmware" button is pressed, the updateFirmware method is called, which triggers the firmware update process.
// 5. When the "Get Device Status" button is pressed, the getDeviceStatus method is called, which retrieves and prints the current status of the device to the console.
```
