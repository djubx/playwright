# Complete Example of flutter_animated_play_button

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_animated_play_button/flutter_animated_play_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // State variable to track if the media is playing
  bool isPlaying = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Play Button Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          // Centering the animated play button in the middle of the screen
          child: AnimatedPlayButton(
            onTap: () {
              // Toggle the play/pause state when the button is tapped
              setState(() {
                isPlaying = !isPlaying; // Change the state
              });
            },
            isPlaying: isPlaying, // Pass the current state to the button
            size: 100.0, // Set the size of the button
            color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the button
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of whether media is playing or not.
// 3. The build method creates a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, an AnimatedPlayButton is created.
// 5. The onTap callback toggles the isPlaying state when the button is tapped.
// 6. The isPlaying state is passed to the AnimatedPlayButton to control its animation.
// 7. The button's size and color are customizable, enhancing the UI experience.
