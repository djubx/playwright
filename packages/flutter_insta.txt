# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Insta Package
=============================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To use the `flutter_insta` package, you need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:

```yml
dependencies:

Then, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to get the package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_insta/flutter_insta.dart';
```

### Step 3: Create a InstaStory Widget

To display an Instagram-style story, you can use the `InstaStory` widget. Here's an example:

```dart
InstaStory(
  story: InstaStoryItem(
    image: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
    duration: Duration(seconds: 10),
  ),
)
```

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />

      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Insta Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: InstaStory(
          stories: _stories,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the application and is presented with a list of Instagram-style stories.
// 2. The user can tap on a story to view it.
// 3. The story is displayed for a duration specified by the developer.
// 4. The user can swipe left or right to navigate between stories.
// 5. The application uses the `flutter_insta` package to display the stories and handle user input.

// The code flow is as follows:
// 1. The `MyApp` widget is created and returned by the `main` function.
// 2. The `MyApp` widget creates a `MaterialApp` widget with a title and theme.
// 3. The `MaterialApp` widget creates a `MyHomePage` widget.
// 4. The `MyHomePage` widget creates a list of `InstaStoryItem` objects and an `InstaStory` widget.
// 5. The `InstaStory` widget displays the list of stories and handles user input.
