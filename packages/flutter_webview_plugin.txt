# Setting Up and Using the Flutter WebView Plugin

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_webview_plugin` and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter applications.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_webview_plugin` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_webview_plugin: ^0.4.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following lines to allow arbitrary loads:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a web view.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_webview_plugin/flutter_webview_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: WebviewScaffold(
        url: "https://flutter.dev",
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text("Flutter WebView Example"),
        ),
        withZoom: true,
        withLocalStorage: true,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple web view that loads the Flutter website. The `WebviewScaffold` widget provides a full-screen web view with an app bar.

# Complete Example of Flutter WebView Plugin

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_webview_plugin/flutter_webview_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // The MaterialApp widget is the root of the application.
    return MaterialApp(
      home: WebviewScaffold(
        // URL to be loaded in the web view.
        url: "https://flutter.dev",
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text("Flutter WebView Example"), // Title of the app bar.
        ),
        withZoom: true, // Enable zoom controls.
        withLocalStorage: true, // Enable local storage.
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The main function is the entry point of the application.
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app.
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The main function is called, which runs the RealFlutter app.
2. The MaterialApp widget is created, which serves as the root of the application.
3. Inside the MaterialApp, a WebviewScaffold is defined.
4. The WebviewScaffold loads the specified URL (https://flutter.dev) in a full-screen web view.
5. An AppBar is displayed at the top with the title "Flutter WebView Example".
6. The web view supports zooming and local storage, enhancing user experience.
7. The user can interact with the web content as if they were using a regular web browser.
