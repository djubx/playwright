# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Share Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_share` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_share: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to share images.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to save images to your photo library.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to share text and images.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_share/flutter_share.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Share Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              await FlutterShare.share(
                title: 'Share Example',
                text: 'Check out this amazing Flutter package!',
                linkUrl: 'https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_share',
                chooserTitle: 'Share with',
              );
            },
            child: Text('Share Text'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a share dialog will appear, allowing users to share the specified text and link.

              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  // Initiating the share dialog for text
                  await FlutterShare.share(
                    title: 'Share Example',
                    text: 'Check out this amazing Flutter package!',

                  );
                },
                child: Text('Share Text'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Button to share an image
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  // Initiating the share dialog for an image
                  await FlutterShare.share(
                    title: 'Share Image',
                    text: 'Here is an image to share!',
                    linkUrl: 'https://example.com/image.png', // Replace with a valid image URL
                    chooserTitle: 'Share Image with',
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Share Image'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. The Scaffold widget provides a structure with an AppBar and a body.
// 3. In the body, a Center widget aligns its children in the center of the screen.
// 4. Two ElevatedButtons are created:
//    - The first button shares text when pressed, invoking the FlutterShare.share method with a title, text, and link.
//    - The second button shares an image when pressed, also invoking the FlutterShare.share method with a title, text, and image link.
// 5. The share dialog appears, allowing users to choose how to share the content.
