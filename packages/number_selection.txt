# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Number Selection Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **number_selection** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  number_selection: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the number selection widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:number_selection/number_selection.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Number Selection Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: NumberSelection(
            min: 0, // Minimum value
            max: 100, // Maximum value
            initialValue: 50, // Starting value
            onChanged: (value) {
              // Callback when the value changes
              print('Selected number: $value');
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the **number_selection** widget. The widget allows users to select a number between 0 and 100, starting at 50. The selected value is printed to the console whenever it changes.

# Complete Example of Number Selection

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:number_selection/number_selection.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Number Selection Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: NumberSelection(
            min: 0, // Set the minimum value to 0
            max: 100, // Set the maximum value to 100
            initialValue: 50, // Set the initial value to 50
            onChanged: (value) {
              // This callback is triggered when the selected value changes
              print('Selected number: $value'); // Print the selected number to the console
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, the NumberSelection widget is created with specified min, max, and initial values.
// 4. When the user interacts with the NumberSelection widget, the onChanged callback is triggered, printing the selected number to the console.
// 5. The user can increment or decrement the number using the provided buttons, and the UI updates accordingly.
```
