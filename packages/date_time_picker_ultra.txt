# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using date_time_picker_ultra

## Installation
To get started with `date_time_picker_ultra`, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  date_time_picker_ultra: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/date_time_picker_ultra).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow for date and time access if your app requires it. Add the following keys if necessary:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your calendar.</string>
<key>NSRemindersUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your reminders.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `date_time_picker_ultra` package, you can create a simple form with a date and time picker. Below is a basic example of how to implement it in your Flutter application.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:date_time_picker_ultra/date_time_picker_ultra.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Date Time Picker Ultra Example',
      home: DateTimePickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class DateTimePickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DateTimePickerExampleState createState() => _DateTimePickerExampleState();
}

class _DateTimePickerExampleState extends State<DateTimePickerExample> {
  // Declare variables to hold the selected date and time
  DateTime? selectedDate;
  TimeOfDay? selectedTime;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Date Time Picker Ultra Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Date Picker
            DateTimePickerUltra(
              type: DateTimePickerType.date,
              dateLabelText: 'Select Date',
              onChanged: (val) {
                // Update the selected date when the user picks a date
                setState(() {
                  selectedDate = DateTime.parse(val);
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Time Picker
            DateTimePickerUltra(
              type: DateTimePickerType.time,
              timeLabelText: 'Select Time',
              onChanged: (val) {
                // Update the selected time when the user picks a time
                setState(() {
                  selectedTime = TimeOfDay.fromDateTime(DateTime.parse(val));
                });
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display selected date and time
            Text(
              'Selected Date: ${selectedDate?.toLocal().toString().split(' ')[0] ?? 'Not selected'}',
            ),
            Text(
              'Selected Time: ${selectedTime?.format(context) ?? 'Not selected'}',
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the date_time_picker_ultra package.
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets the home widget to DateTimePickerExample.
// 2. The DateTimePickerExample widget is a stateful widget that maintains the selected date and time.
// 3. Inside the build method, we create a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body containing two DateTimePickerUltra widgets.
// 4. The first picker is for selecting a date, and the second is for selecting a time.
// 5. When a user selects a date or time, the onChanged callback updates the respective state variables.
// 6. Finally, we display the selected date and time below the pickers, updating the UI dynamically as selections are made.
