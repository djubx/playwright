# Complete Example of Ubicons in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ubicons/ubicons.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Ubicons Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Using a Ubicon icon
              Ubicon(
                icon: Ubicons.home, // Specify the icon you want to use
                size: 50.0, // Set the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text('Home Icon from Ubicons'), // Text below the icon
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp() to start the RealFlutter widget.
2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the basic structure for the app.
3. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which includes an AppBar and a body.
4. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
5. A Column widget is used to arrange the Ubicon and Text widgets vertically.
6. The Ubicon widget displays a home icon from the Ubicons package, with specified size and color.
7. A SizedBox is used to add space between the icon and the text.
8. Finally, a Text widget displays a label below the icon, indicating what the icon represents.
