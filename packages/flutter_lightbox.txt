# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_lightbox`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with `flutter_lightbox`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lightbox: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add permissions for accessing the photo library if you are loading images from the user's device. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to display images.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `flutter_lightbox` package.

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_lightbox`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_lightbox/flutter_lightbox.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Lightbox Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Lightbox Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: GestureDetector(
            // When the user taps on the image, it opens in the lightbox
            onTap: () {
              showLightbox(context, [
                // List of images to display in the lightbox
                'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
                'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
                'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
              ]);
            },
            child: Image.network(
              // Thumbnail image displayed on the main screen
              'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
              width: 100,
              height: 100,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to show the lightbox with the provided images
  void showLightbox(BuildContext context, List<String> images) {
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return Lightbox(
          images: images.map((url) => LightboxImage(url: url)).toList(),
          // Optional: Customize the lightbox appearance
          backgroundColor: Colors.black54,
          onDismiss: () {
            // Action to perform when the lightbox is dismissed
            Navigator.of(context).pop();
          },
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a simple UI containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, a GestureDetector wraps an Image widget.
// 4. When the user taps on the image, the onTap callback is triggered, calling the showLightbox function.
// 5. The showLightbox function displays a dialog containing the Lightbox widget with the specified images.
// 6. The Lightbox allows users to swipe through images and dismiss the overlay by tapping outside or using a close button.
```
