# Setting Up the "day" Package

To get started with the **day** package, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Add Dependency

First, you need to add the **day** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  day: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to handle any specific permissions related to date and time access, although the **day** package does not require special permissions.

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart files, import the **day** package:

```dart
import 'package:day/day.dart';
```

## Step 5: Basic Usage

You can now start using the **day** package in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a date, manipulate it, and format it:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create a new date
  final today = Day.now();
  
  // Add 5 days to today
  final futureDate = today.addDays(5);
  
  // Format the date
  print('Today: ${today.format('yyyy-MM-dd')}');
  print('Future Date: ${futureDate.format('yyyy-MM-dd')}');
}
```

This basic setup and usage guide should help you get started with the **day** package in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using the "day" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:day/day.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Day Package Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Day Package Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: DateDisplay(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class DateDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get today's date
    final today = Day.now();
    
    // Add 10 days to today's date
    final futureDate = today.addDays(10);
    
    // Format today's date and the future date
    final formattedToday = today.format('yyyy-MM-dd');
    final formattedFutureDate = futureDate.format('yyyy-MM-dd');
    
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Today: $formattedToday'),
        Text('Future Date (10 days later): $formattedFutureDate'),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a centered body with the DateDisplay widget.
// 4. The DateDisplay widget retrieves today's date using Day.now().
// 5. It then calculates a future date by adding 10 days to today.
// 6. Both dates are formatted as 'yyyy-MM-dd' for display.
// 7. Finally, the formatted dates are displayed in a column in the center of the screen.
```
