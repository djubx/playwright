# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `text_highlight_codespark`

## Installation
To get started with the `text_highlight_codespark` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  text_highlight_codespark: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/text_highlight_codespark).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if your application requires internet access or other specific features.

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you will need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:text_highlight_codespark/text_highlight_codespark.dart';
```

You can then create a `TextHighlight` widget to display highlighted text. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
TextHighlight(
  text: 'Your code or text here',
  highlights: [
    HighlightedText(
      text: 'keyword',
      backgroundColor: Colors.yellow,
      textColor: Colors.black,
    ),
  ],
)
```

This will highlight the word "keyword" in yellow with black text.

## Additional Configuration
You can customize the highlighting rules further by defining multiple `HighlightedText` objects and passing them to the `highlights` parameter.

With this setup, you are ready to start using the `text_highlight_codespark` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using `text_highlight_codespark`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:text_highlight_codespark/text_highlight_codespark.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Text Highlight Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Text Highlight Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // Displaying highlighted text
              TextHighlight(
                text: 'This is a sample code: print("Hello, World!");',
                highlights: [
                  // Highlighting the keyword 'print'
                  HighlightedText(
                    text: 'print',
                    backgroundColor: Colors.yellow,
                    textColor: Colors.black,
                  ),
                  // Highlighting the string 'Hello, World!'
                  HighlightedText(
                    text: '"Hello, World!"',
                    backgroundColor: Colors.lightBlue,
                    textColor: Colors.white,
                  ),
                ],
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Another example of highlighted text
              TextHighlight(
                text: 'Flutter is awesome!',
                highlights: [
                  // Highlighting the word 'awesome'
                  HighlightedText(
                    text: 'awesome',
                    backgroundColor: Colors.green,
                    textColor: Colors.white,
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Text Highlight Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Padding widget to provide space around the content.
// 5. Inside the Padding, a Column widget is used to stack multiple TextHighlight widgets vertically.
// 6. The first TextHighlight widget displays a sample code line with the keyword 'print' highlighted in yellow and the string 'Hello, World!' highlighted in light blue.
// 7. The second TextHighlight widget displays a simple sentence with the word 'awesome' highlighted in green.
// 8. The app showcases how to use the text_highlight_codespark package to highlight specific parts of text effectively.
