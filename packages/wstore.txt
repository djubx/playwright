# Overview of the wstore Flutter Package

The **wstore** package is a powerful and flexible solution for managing local storage in Flutter applications. It provides a simple API for storing and retrieving data, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to implement persistent storage without the complexity of traditional databases.

## When to Use wstore
- **Local Data Storage**: When you need to store user preferences, settings, or any other small amounts of data locally.
- **Caching**: To cache data fetched from the network, improving performance and user experience.
- **Offline Support**: For applications that require offline capabilities, allowing users to access data without an internet connection.

## Key Features
- **Simple API**: Easy-to-use methods for storing and retrieving data.
- **Data Types Support**: Supports various data types, including strings, integers, lists, and maps.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Built on Dart's Future and Stream APIs, ensuring non-blocking operations.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.

The wstore package is ideal for developers who want a straightforward solution for local data management without the overhead of more complex database systems.

# Setting Up and Using wstore

## Installation
To add the wstore package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wstore: ^latest_version
```

Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/wstore).

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. The package works out of the box.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` file if you plan to access any sensitive data. However, for basic storage operations, no special permissions are needed.

## Basic Usage
To use the wstore package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:wstore/wstore.dart';
```

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use wstore to store and retrieve data:

```dart
void main() async {
  // Initialize the wstore
  await WStore.init();

  // Store a value
  await WStore.setString('username', 'RealFlutter');

  // Retrieve the value
  String? username = await WStore.getString('username');
  print('Stored username: $username');
}
```

This example demonstrates initializing the wstore, storing a string value, and retrieving it.

# Complete Example of wstore in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wstore/wstore.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure that Flutter is initialized before running the app
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize the wstore for data storage
  await WStore.init();
  
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'wstore Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  String _username = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load the stored username when the screen initializes
    _loadUsername();
  }

  // Function to load the username from storage
  Future<void> _loadUsername() async {
    // Retrieve the username from wstore
    String? username = await WStore.getString('username');
    // Update the state with the retrieved username
    setState(() {
      _username = username ?? 'No username stored';
    });
  }

  // Function to save a new username
  Future<void> _saveUsername(String username) async {
    // Store the new username in wstore
    await WStore.setString('username', username);
    // Reload the username to update the UI
    _loadUsername();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('wstore Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Stored Username: $_username'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            TextField(
              onSubmitted: _saveUsername,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter new username',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing Flutter and the wstore package.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp and HomeScreen.
// 3. In HomeScreen, the _loadUsername method is called during initState to fetch the stored username.
// 4. The username is displayed in the UI, and a TextField allows users to input a new username.
// 5. When the user submits a new username, the _saveUsername method is called, which stores the new username and refreshes the displayed value.
