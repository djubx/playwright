# Password Generator Flutter Package

The `password_generator` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to create secure and random passwords for applications. It is particularly useful in scenarios where user authentication is required, and strong passwords are essential for maintaining security. This package allows developers to generate passwords of varying lengths and complexities, ensuring that users can create secure credentials easily.

## When to Use This Package
- **User Registration**: When users create accounts, you can provide them with a strong password suggestion.
- **Password Reset**: Automatically generate a new password for users who forget their credentials.
- **Security Applications**: Any application that requires secure password generation for user accounts or sensitive data.

## Features
- **Customizable Password Length**: Specify the length of the generated password.
- **Character Set Options**: Choose to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that can be easily integrated into any Flutter application.

With these features, the `password_generator` package simplifies the process of creating secure passwords, enhancing the overall security of your application.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Password Generator Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `password_generator` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  password_generator: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to generate a password:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:password_generator/password_generator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Password Generator')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Generate a password with default settings
              String password = PasswordGenerator.generate();
              print('Generated Password: $password');
            },
            child: Text('Generate Password'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a random password is generated and printed to the console.

## Summary
This tutorial covered the installation and basic usage of the `password_generator` package in a Flutter application. You learned how to set up the package for both Android and iOS platforms and how to generate a password using a simple button click.

# Complete Example of Using the Password Generator Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:password_generator/password_generator.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _generatedPassword = '';

  // Function to generate a password
  void _generatePassword() {
    // Generate a password with default settings
    String password = PasswordGenerator.generate();
    // Update the state with the new password
    setState(() {
      _generatedPassword = password;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Password Generator')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Display the generated password
              Text(
                _generatedPassword.isEmpty ? 'No password generated yet' : _generatedPassword,
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Button to generate a new password
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _generatePassword,
                child: Text('Generate Password'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

// This Flutter application demonstrates the use of the password_generator package.
// The app consists of a simple UI with a button to generate a password and a text widget to display it.
// When the app starts, no password is displayed. 
// Upon pressing the "Generate Password" button, a new password is generated and displayed on the screen.
// The _generatePassword function is called when the button is pressed, which generates a password and updates the state.
// The generated password is shown in a bold text format, making it easy for users to see their new password.
