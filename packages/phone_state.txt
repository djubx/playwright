# Overview of the "phone_state" Flutter Package

The `phone_state` Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to monitor the phone's state, including call status, phone number, and other telephony-related information. This package is particularly useful for applications that require real-time updates on phone state changes, such as call management apps, messaging apps, or any application that needs to respond to telephony events.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the `phone_state` package in scenarios such as:
- **Call Management Applications**: To track incoming, outgoing, and missed calls.
- **Messaging Applications**: To determine if the user is on a call before sending a message.
- **Telephony Services**: To provide features like call blocking or call forwarding.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Call State Monitoring**: Listen for changes in call state (idle, ringing, off-hook).
- **Access to Phone Number**: Retrieve the phone number of the device (with appropriate permissions).
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS with minimal configuration.

The `phone_state` package is a great addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit, especially for those looking to integrate telephony features into their applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "phone_state" Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `phone_state` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  phone_state: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG"/>
```

3. Ensure that your app's `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `Info.plist` located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission to access phone state:

```xml
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your contacts to provide better service.</string>
<key>NSPhoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your phone state to manage calls.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `phone_state` package in your app.

# Complete Example of Using the "phone_state" Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:phone_state/phone_state.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _callState = "Unknown"; // Variable to hold the current call state

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start listening to phone state changes
    PhoneState.phoneStateStream.listen((PhoneStateStatus status) {
      // Update the call state based on the status received
      setState(() {
        _callState = status.toString();
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Phone State Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Current Call State: $_callState', // Display the current call state
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Clean up the stream subscription when the widget is disposed
    super.dispose();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize a state variable _callState to hold the current call state.
// 3. In the initState method, we set up a listener on the phone state stream.
// 4. Whenever the phone state changes, the listener updates the _callState variable.
// 5. The build method returns a MaterialApp with a simple UI that displays the current call state.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, we ensure to clean up any resources used by the stream.
