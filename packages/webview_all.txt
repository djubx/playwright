# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `webview_all`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `webview_all` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  webview_all: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 19 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 19
    }
}
```

### iOS

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow arbitrary loads:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a web view using the `webview_all` package.

# Complete Example of Using `webview_all`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:webview_all/webview_all.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'WebView Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: WebViewExample(),
    );
  }
}

class WebViewExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _WebViewExampleState createState() => _WebViewExampleState();
}

class _WebViewExampleState extends State<WebViewExample> {
  // Controller to manage the web view
  late WebViewController _controller;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('WebView Example'),
        // Adding navigation buttons
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_back),
            onPressed: () {
              // Go back in the web view
              _controller.goBack();
            },
          ),
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),
            onPressed: () {
              // Go forward in the web view
              _controller.goForward();
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: WebView(
        initialUrl: 'https://flutter.dev', // Initial URL to load
        onWebViewCreated: (WebViewController webViewController) {
          // Assigning the controller
          _controller = webViewController;
        },
        onPageFinished: (String url) {
          // Callback when the page finishes loading
          print('Page finished loading: $url');
        },
        onWebResourceError: (WebResourceError error) {
          // Handling web resource errors
          print('Error: ${error.description}');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to WebViewExample, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In WebViewExample, a WebView is created with an initial URL.
// 5. The WebViewController is used to manage the web view, allowing navigation.
// 6. The app bar contains buttons for navigating back and forward in the web view.
// 7. Callbacks are provided to handle page loading and errors, enhancing user experience.
```
