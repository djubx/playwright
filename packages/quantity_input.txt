# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Quantity Input Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `quantity_input` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  quantity_input: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:quantity_input/quantity_input.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Widget
You can now use the `QuantityInput` widget in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement it in a simple app.

### Platform-Specific Details
- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues.
- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required, but ensure your deployment target is set appropriately in `ios/Podfile`.

### Example Usage
You can customize the `QuantityInput` widget by specifying parameters such as `minValue`, `maxValue`, and `initialValue`. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
QuantityInput(
  value: 1,
  minValue: 1,
  maxValue: 10,
  onChanged: (value) {
    print('Quantity changed to: $value');
  },
)
```

This widget will allow users to select a quantity between 1 and 10, starting from an initial value of 1.

# Complete Example of Quantity Input in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:quantity_input/quantity_input.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Quantity Input Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Quantity Input Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: QuantityInputExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class QuantityInputExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _QuantityInputExampleState createState() => _QuantityInputExampleState();
}

class _QuantityInputExampleState extends State<QuantityInputExample> {
  // Variable to hold the current quantity
  int _quantity = 1;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the current quantity
        Text(
          'Selected Quantity: $_quantity',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        // Quantity input widget
        QuantityInput(
          value: _quantity,
          minValue: 1, // Minimum quantity
          maxValue: 10, // Maximum quantity
          onChanged: (value) {
            // Update the state with the new quantity
            setState(() {
              _quantity = value; // Update the quantity
            });
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a centered body with the QuantityInputExample widget.
// 4. QuantityInputExample is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current quantity state.
// 5. The build method displays the current quantity and the QuantityInput widget.
// 6. When the quantity is changed, the onChanged callback updates the state, which triggers a rebuild to reflect the new quantity.
```
