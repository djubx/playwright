# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Frino Icons

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **frino_icons** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  frino_icons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the **frino_icons** package:

```dart
import 'package:frino_icons/frino_icons.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using Frino Icons

You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use an icon in a `Container`:

```dart
Container(
  child: Icon(
    FrinoIcons.example_icon, // Replace with the desired icon
    size: 50.0, // Set the size of the icon
    color: Colors.blue, // Set the color of the icon
  ),
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to avoid compatibility issues:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` if you encounter any issues with icon rendering:

```xml
<key>UIAppFonts</key>
<array>
    <string>FrinoIcons.ttf</string> <!-- Ensure the font file is included -->
</array>
```

## Step 4: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons further by adjusting their properties. For example, you can wrap the icon in a `GestureDetector` to make it interactive:

```dart
GestureDetector(
  onTap: () {
    // Handle icon tap
  },
  child: Icon(
    FrinoIcons.example_icon,
    size: 50.0,
    color: Colors.red,
  ),
)
```

With these steps, you can effectively integrate and use the **frino_icons** package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Frino Icons in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:frino_icons/frino_icons.dart'; // Importing the frino_icons package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Frino Icons Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Frino Icons Demo'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a Frino icon
              Icon(
                FrinoIcons.example_icon, // Using an example icon from frino_icons
                size: 100.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between the icon and text
              Text(
                'Tap the icon!', // Instruction text
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Text style
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space
              GestureDetector(
                onTap: () {
                  // Action to perform on icon tap
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text('Icon Tapped!')), // SnackBar message
                  );
                },
                child: Icon(
                  FrinoIcons.example_icon, // Using the same icon for interaction
                  size: 100.0,
                  color: Colors.red, // Changing color for interaction
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget to center the content.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the icon and text vertically.
// 5. The first Icon widget displays a Frino icon in blue color.
// 6. A Text widget instructs the user to tap the icon.
// 7. A GestureDetector wraps another Icon widget, allowing it to be tappable.
// 8. When the icon is tapped, a SnackBar appears at the bottom of the screen with a message.
