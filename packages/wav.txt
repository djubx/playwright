# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the "wav" Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the "wav" package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  wav: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the microphone if you plan to record audio:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request permission for microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to record audio.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save audio files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the "wav" package to read a WAV file and play it back:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wav/wav.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Method to read and play a WAV file
  void playWavFile(String filePath) async {
    // Load the WAV file
    final wavFile = await Wav.read(filePath);
    
    // Play the WAV file
    wavFile.play();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('WAV Player')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            playWavFile('assets/sample.wav'); // Path to your WAV file
          },
          child: Text('Play WAV File'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that plays a WAV file when a button is pressed. Make sure to replace `'assets/sample.wav'` with the actual path to your WAV file.

# Complete Example: A Functional Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wav/wav.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Method to read and play a WAV file
  void playWavFile(String filePath) async {
    // Load the WAV file
    final wavFile = await Wav.read(filePath);
    
    // Play the WAV file
    wavFile.play();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('WAV Player')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            playWavFile('assets/sample.wav'); // Path to your WAV file
          },
          child: Text('Play WAV File'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(),
  ));
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that manages its state.
// 3. In the _RealFlutterState class, we define a method playWavFile that takes a file path as an argument.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the playWavFile method is called with the path to the WAV file.
// 5. The WAV file is read using Wav.read(), and then played using wavFile.play().
// 6. The UI consists of a simple button that triggers the audio playback when pressed.
```
