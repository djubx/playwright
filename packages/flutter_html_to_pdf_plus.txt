# Complete Example of flutter_html_to_pdf_plus

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_html_to_pdf_plus/flutter_html_to_pdf_plus.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('HTML to PDF Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Define the HTML content to be converted to PDF
              String htmlContent = "<h1>Hello, World!</h1><p>This is a PDF generated from HTML.</p>";
              
              // Convert the HTML content to a PDF file
              var pdfFile = await FlutterHtmlToPdfPlus.convertFromHtml(
                htmlContent, // The HTML content
                'output.pdf', // The name of the output PDF file
                'output_directory', // The directory where the PDF will be saved
                'output.pdf', // The name of the PDF file again
              );

              // Show a notification to the user indicating the PDF has been created
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                SnackBar(content: Text('PDF created at: ${pdfFile.path}')),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Generate PDF'), // Button text
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback.
// 5. The HTML content is defined as a string.
// 6. The convertFromHtml method is called to convert the HTML string into a PDF file.
// 7. Once the PDF is created, a SnackBar notification is displayed to inform the user of the PDF's location.
