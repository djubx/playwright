# Exploring the qibla_direction Flutter Package

The `qibla_direction` package is a Flutter library designed to help developers determine the Qibla direction from any location on Earth. This is particularly useful for Muslim users who need to find the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca for their daily prayers. The package utilizes the device's location services to calculate the Qibla direction accurately.

## When to Use This Package
- **Islamic Applications**: If you are developing an app that serves the Muslim community, this package is essential for providing accurate prayer direction.
- **Location-Based Services**: Any application that requires geographical orientation can benefit from this package.

## Key Features
- **Accurate Qibla Direction**: Calculates the Qibla direction based on the user's current geographical location.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows for quick implementation in Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the qibla_direction Package

## Installation
To use the `qibla_direction` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  qibla_direction: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions to access the device's location:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to find the Qibla direction.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to find the Qibla direction.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the `qibla_direction` package, you can follow these steps in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:qibla_direction/qibla_direction.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of the `QiblaDirection` class and call the method to get the Qibla direction.

```dart
QiblaDirection qiblaDirection = QiblaDirection();
```

3. Use the `getQiblaDirection()` method to retrieve the direction.

```dart
double direction = await qiblaDirection.getQiblaDirection();
```

This will return the Qibla direction in degrees, which you can then use to display an arrow or compass in your app.

# Complete Example of Using the qibla_direction Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:qibla_direction/qibla_direction.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  double _qiblaDirection = 0.0; // Variable to hold the Qibla direction

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getQiblaDirection(); // Call the method to get Qibla direction on initialization
  }

  // Method to get the Qibla direction
  Future<void> _getQiblaDirection() async {
    QiblaDirection qiblaDirection = QiblaDirection();
    double direction = await qiblaDirection.getQiblaDirection(); // Fetch the Qibla direction
    setState(() {
      _qiblaDirection = direction; // Update the state with the new direction
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Qibla Direction'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Qibla Direction:',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              Text(
                '${_qiblaDirection.toStringAsFixed(2)}Â°', // Display the Qibla direction
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we define a stateful widget to manage the Qibla direction state.
// 3. The _getQiblaDirection method is called in initState to fetch the Qibla direction when the widget is initialized.
// 4. The Qibla direction is retrieved using the getQiblaDirection method from the QiblaDirection class.
// 5. The state is updated with the fetched direction, which triggers a rebuild of the UI.
// 6. The Qibla direction is displayed in degrees on the screen.
