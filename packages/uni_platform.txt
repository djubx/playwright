# Overview of the uni_platform Flutter Package

The `uni_platform` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of writing platform-specific code. It allows developers to easily detect the platform (iOS, Android, Web, etc.) their application is running on and execute platform-specific logic accordingly. This is particularly useful when you need to implement features that behave differently across platforms, such as accessing device features or customizing UI elements.

## When to Use `uni_platform`

- **Cross-Platform Development**: When building applications that need to run on multiple platforms with different behaviors.
- **Conditional Logic**: When you need to execute specific code based on the platform, such as using different APIs or UI components.
- **Feature Detection**: When you want to check for the availability of certain features on a specific platform.

## Key Features

- **Platform Detection**: Easily determine the current platform (iOS, Android, Web, etc.).
- **Conditional Execution**: Write platform-specific code blocks that execute only on the relevant platform.
- **Simplified API**: A clean and straightforward API that makes it easy to integrate into your Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the uni_platform Package

## Installation

To get started with the `uni_platform` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  uni_platform: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to request permissions for certain features, depending on your app's requirements.

## Using the Package

To use the `uni_platform` package, you can import it into your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:uni_platform/uni_platform.dart';
```

You can then use the `UniPlatform` class to check the current platform and execute platform-specific code. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
if (UniPlatform.isAndroid) {
  // Execute Android-specific code
} else if (UniPlatform.isIOS) {
  // Execute iOS-specific code
} else if (UniPlatform.isWeb) {
  // Execute Web-specific code
}
```

This allows you to maintain a clean codebase while still catering to the unique requirements of each platform.

# Complete Example of Using uni_platform

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:uni_platform/uni_platform.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'uni_platform Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('uni_platform Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: PlatformSpecificWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PlatformSpecificWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Check the platform and return a different widget accordingly
    if (UniPlatform.isAndroid) {
      return Text('This is an Android device!');
    } else if (UniPlatform.isIOS) {
      return Text('This is an iOS device!');
    } else if (UniPlatform.isWeb) {
      return Text('This is a Web application!');
    } else {
      return Text('Unknown platform!');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered body.
// 4. The body contains the PlatformSpecificWidget, which checks the current platform using UniPlatform.
// 5. Depending on the platform detected, it displays a different message to the user.
```

In summary, the `uni_platform` package provides a straightforward way to manage platform-specific code in Flutter applications. By detecting the platform at runtime, developers can ensure that their applications behave correctly across different environments, enhancing the user experience.
