# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Widget Kit Plugin

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `widget_kit_plugin` and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `widget_kit_plugin` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  widget_kit_plugin: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For iOS

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSWidgetKitUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to WidgetKit for displaying widgets.</string>
```

2. Ensure that your deployment target is set to iOS 14.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '14.0'
```

### For Android

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure that you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21  // Minimum SDK version
        ...
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if required.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple widget using the `RealFlutter` class.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_kit_plugin/widget_kit_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Widget Kit Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the widget update
              WidgetKitPlugin.updateWidget();
            },
            child: Text('Update Widget'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that updates the widget when pressed.

# Complete Example of Using Widget Kit Plugin

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widget_kit_plugin/widget_kit_plugin.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Widget Kit Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the widget update
              WidgetKitPlugin.updateWidget();
            },
            child: Text('Update Widget'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the app's visual layout, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, calls the updateWidget method from the WidgetKitPlugin.
// 6. This method triggers an update to the widget, allowing it to reflect any changes made in the app.
// 7. The user can interact with the button to see the widget update in real-time.
