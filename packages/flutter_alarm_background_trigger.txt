## When to Use This Package
- **Alarm Applications**: If you're building an app that needs to trigger alarms at specific times.
- **Task Scheduling**: For apps that require background processing of tasks at scheduled intervals.
- **Notifications**: When you need to send notifications based on time triggers, regardless of the app's state.

## Key Features
- **Background Task Scheduling**: Schedule tasks to run in the background.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS.
- **Flexible Timing Options**: Allows for precise scheduling of tasks.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for integrating into existing Flutter applications.

This package is a powerful tool for developers looking to implement background task scheduling in their Flutter applications.

# flutter_alarm_background_trigger: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the `flutter_alarm_background_trigger` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_alarm_background_trigger: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_alarm_background_trigger).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
```

2. **Service Declaration**: Declare the background service in the same file:

```xml
<service android:name="com.example.flutter_alarm_background_trigger.AlarmService" android:permission="android.permission.BIND_JOB_SERVICE"/>
```

### iOS
1. **Background Modes**: Enable background modes in your Xcode project:
   - Open your project in Xcode.
   - Select your project in the navigator.
   - Go to the "Capabilities" tab.
   - Enable "Background Modes" and check "Background fetch".

2. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the package, you can start by initializing the alarm service and scheduling a task. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_alarm_background_trigger/flutter_alarm_background_trigger.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: AlarmHome(),
    );
  }
}

class AlarmHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AlarmHomeState createState() => _AlarmHomeState();
}

class _AlarmHomeState extends State<AlarmHome> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the alarm service
    FlutterAlarmBackgroundTrigger.initialize();
  }

  void scheduleAlarm() {
    // Schedule an alarm to trigger in 5 seconds
    FlutterAlarmBackgroundTrigger.scheduleAlarm(
      alarmId: 1,
      time: DateTime.now().add(Duration(seconds: 5)),
      title: "Alarm Triggered",
      body: "This is a scheduled alarm notification.",
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Alarm Background Trigger")),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: scheduleAlarm,
          child: Text("Schedule Alarm"),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize the alarm service and schedule an alarm to trigger after 5 seconds when the button is pressed.

# Complete Example of flutter_alarm_background_trigger

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_alarm_background_trigger/flutter_alarm_background_trigger.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: AlarmHome(),
    );
  }
}

class AlarmHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AlarmHomeState createState() => _AlarmHomeState();
}

class _AlarmHomeState extends State<AlarmHome> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the alarm service when the app starts
    FlutterAlarmBackgroundTrigger.initialize();
  }

  void scheduleAlarm() {
    // Schedule an alarm to trigger in 5 seconds
    FlutterAlarmBackgroundTrigger.scheduleAlarm(
      alarmId: 1, // Unique ID for the alarm
      time: DateTime.now().add(Duration(seconds: 5)), // Set the time for the alarm
      title: "Alarm Triggered", // Title of the notification
      body: "This is a scheduled alarm notification.", // Body of the notification
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Alarm Background Trigger")),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: scheduleAlarm, // Call scheduleAlarm when button is pressed
          child: Text("Schedule Alarm"), // Button text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the MyApp widget is created.
// 2. The AlarmHome widget is displayed, which initializes the alarm service in its initState method.
// 3. When the user presses the "Schedule Alarm" button, the scheduleAlarm method is called.
// 4. The scheduleAlarm method schedules an alarm to trigger in 5 seconds with a notification title and body.
// 5. After 5 seconds, the alarm will trigger, and the notification will be displayed to the user.
