// The app starts by running the `main` function, which creates a new instance of the `MyApp` widget.
// The `MyApp` widget builds a `MaterialApp` with a title and theme.
// The `home` property of the `MaterialApp` is set to an instance of the `MyHomePage` widget.
// The `MyHomePage` widget builds a `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget.
// The `Center` widget contains an `ElevatedButton` that, when pressed, calls the `_scheduleBackgroundTask` function.
// The `_scheduleBackgroundTask` function schedules a background task to run every hour using the `FlutterAlarmBackgroundTrigger.schedule` method.
// When the background task runs, it prints a message to the console.
// After scheduling the background task, the function shows a snackbar to confirm the task has been scheduled.

// In summary, the app schedules a background task to run every hour when the user presses a button, and shows a snackbar to confirm the task has been scheduled.
