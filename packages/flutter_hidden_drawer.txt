# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_hidden_drawer

## Installation
To use the `flutter_hidden_drawer` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_hidden_drawer: ^0.3.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your app requires any specific permissions.

## Basic Usage
To implement the hidden drawer, you will need to create a `RealFlutter` class that extends `StatefulWidget`. Here’s a basic setup:

1. **Create a Drawer Item**: Define the items that will be displayed in the drawer.
2. **Implement the Hidden Drawer**: Use the `HiddenDrawer` widget to create the drawer.

Here’s a simple example of how to set it up:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hidden_drawer/flutter_hidden_drawer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return HiddenDrawer(
      backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
      items: [
        // Define your drawer items here
        DrawerItem(
          icon: Icons.home,
          text: "Home",
          onTap: () {
            // Handle Home tap
          },
        ),
        DrawerItem(
          icon: Icons.settings,
          text: "Settings",
          onTap: () {
            // Handle Settings tap
          },
        ),
      ],
      // Main content of the app
      screen: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Hidden Drawer Example")),
        body: Center(child: Text("Welcome to Hidden Drawer!")),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic hidden drawer with two items: Home and Settings. The `HiddenDrawer` widget takes care of the drawer's appearance and behavior.

# Complete Example of flutter_hidden_drawer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hidden_drawer/flutter_hidden_drawer.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return HiddenDrawer(
      backgroundColor: Colors.blue, // Set the background color of the drawer
      items: [
        // Define the drawer items with icons and text
        DrawerItem(
          icon: Icons.home, // Icon for Home
          text: "Home", // Text for Home
          onTap: () {
            // Action when Home is tapped
            print("Home tapped");
          },
        ),
        DrawerItem(
          icon: Icons.settings, // Icon for Settings
          text: "Settings", // Text for Settings
          onTap: () {
            // Action when Settings is tapped
            print("Settings tapped");
          },
        ),
      ],
      // Main content of the app
      screen: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Hidden Drawer Example")), // AppBar title
        body: Center(child: Text("Welcome to Hidden Drawer!")), // Main content
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application starts here
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(), // Set RealFlutter as the home widget
  ));
}
```

// Explanation of the application flow:
// 1. The `main` function initializes the Flutter app and sets `RealFlutter` as the home widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` class is a StatefulWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the `build` method, a `HiddenDrawer` widget is created with a blue background.
// 4. Two `DrawerItem` widgets are defined, each with an icon, text, and an onTap action that prints to the console.
// 5. The main screen of the app is a `Scaffold` with an AppBar and a centered text widget.
// 6. When the drawer items are tapped, the corresponding actions are executed, allowing for navigation or other functionalities.
