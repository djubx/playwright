## Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Loglytics

### Installation
To add the Loglytics package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  loglytics: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

3. Add any necessary configurations for Loglytics in the `onCreate` method of your `MainActivity.java` or `MainActivity.kt`.

#### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

### Basic Usage
To start using Loglytics in your Flutter application, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:loglytics/loglytics.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Loglytics with your API key
  Loglytics.initialize(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Loglytics Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Loglytics Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Log a custom event
            Loglytics.logEvent('button_clicked', {'button_name': 'example_button'});
          },
          child: Text('Click Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we initialize Loglytics with an API key and log a custom event when a button is clicked.

## Complete Example: Loglytics in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:loglytics/loglytics.dart';

void main() {
  // Initialize Loglytics with your API key
  Loglytics.initialize(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Loglytics Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Loglytics Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Log a custom event when the button is clicked
            Loglytics.logEvent('button_clicked', {'button_name': 'example_button'});
          },
          child: Text('Click Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes Loglytics with an API key and runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. HomeScreen displays a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered button.
// 4. When the button is clicked, a custom event 'button_clicked' is logged to Loglytics with additional data about the button.
