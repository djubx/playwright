# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_fader`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `flutter_fader` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_fader: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the `flutter_fader` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_fader/flutter_fader.dart';
```

You can then use the `Fader` widget to wrap any widget you want to apply the fade effect to. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
Fader(
  duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
  child: Text('Hello, Flutter Fader!'),
)
```

This will create a fade-in effect for the text when it is displayed.

## Step 4: Customizing the Fader

You can customize the `Fader` widget by adjusting its properties, such as `duration`, `fadeIn`, and `fadeOut`. Here’s an example of a more complex usage:

```dart
Fader(
  duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
  fadeIn: true,
  fadeOut: true,
  child: Image.network('https://example.com/image.png'),
)
```

This will fade in the image over 2 seconds and fade it out when it is removed from the widget tree.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `flutter_fader` package in your Flutter applications effectively.

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_fader`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_fader/flutter_fader.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // State variable to control the visibility of the fading widget
  bool _isVisible = true;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Fader Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Fader widget that fades in and out based on _isVisible
              Fader(
                duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
                child: _isVisible
                    ? Text(
                        'Hello, Flutter Fader!',
                        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                      )
                    : Container(), // Empty container when not visible
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Toggle the visibility state
                  setState(() {
                    _isVisible = !_isVisible;
                  });
                },
                child: Text(_isVisible ? 'Fade Out' : 'Fade In'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the visibility state of the text.
// 3. In the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the Fader and a button vertically.
// 5. The Fader widget wraps a Text widget that displays a message. It fades in and out based on the _isVisible state.
// 6. The ElevatedButton toggles the _isVisible state when pressed, causing the Fader to animate the text's visibility.
```
