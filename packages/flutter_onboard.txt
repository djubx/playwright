# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_onboard`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_onboard` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_onboard: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now, you can start using the `flutter_onboard` package in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement onboarding screens.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_onboard/flutter_onboard.dart';
```

2. Create a list of onboarding pages:

```dart
final List<OnBoardModel> onboardData = [
  OnBoardModel(
    title: "Welcome to Our App",
    description: "Discover amazing features and functionalities.",
    image: "assets/images/onboard1.png",
  ),
  OnBoardModel(
    title: "Stay Connected",
    description: "Connect with friends and family easily.",
    image: "assets/images/onboard2.png",
  ),
  OnBoardModel(
    title: "Get Started",
    description: "Let's get you started with our app.",
    image: "assets/images/onboard3.png",
  ),
];
```

3. Implement the onboarding screens in your main widget:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: OnBoardingScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class OnBoardingScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return OnBoard(
      pages: onboardData,
      onFinish: () {
        // Navigate to the main application screen
        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
          MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => MainScreen()),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

4. Create a simple main screen to navigate to after onboarding:

```dart
class MainScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Main Screen")),
      body: Center(child: Text("Welcome to the Main Screen!")),
    );
  }
}
```

Now, you have a basic onboarding flow set up in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of `flutter_onboard`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_onboard/flutter_onboard.dart';

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: OnBoardingScreen(),
    );
  }
}

// Onboarding screen widget
class OnBoardingScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  // List of onboarding pages
  final List<OnBoardModel> onboardData = [
    OnBoardModel(
      title: "Welcome to Our App",
      description: "Discover amazing features and functionalities.",
      image: "assets/images/onboard1.png",
    ),
    OnBoardModel(
      title: "Stay Connected",
      description: "Connect with friends and family easily.",
      image: "assets/images/onboard2.png",
    ),
    OnBoardModel(
      title: "Get Started",
      description: "Let's get you started with our app.",
      image: "assets/images/onboard3.png",
    ),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return OnBoard(
      pages: onboardData, // Pass the onboarding pages
      onFinish: () {
        // Navigate to the main application screen when onboarding is finished
        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
          MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => MainScreen()),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Main screen widget after onboarding
class MainScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Main Screen")), // App bar title
      body: Center(child: Text("Welcome to the Main Screen!")), // Main content
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds the MaterialApp and sets OnBoardingScreen as the home widget.
// 3. OnBoardingScreen initializes a list of OnBoardModel objects representing each onboarding page.
// 4. The OnBoard widget displays the onboarding pages and handles navigation to the MainScreen upon completion.
// 5. MainScreen is a simple widget that displays a welcome message after the onboarding process is finished.
```
