# Angel3 Static Flutter Package

The **angel3_static** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to serve static files efficiently. It is part of the Angel framework, which is designed to create web applications and APIs with ease. This package allows developers to serve static assets such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images directly from their Flutter applications.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **angel3_static** package when:
- You need to serve static files in a Flutter web application.
- You want to create a simple web server to host your assets without the overhead of a full backend.
- You are building a Progressive Web App (PWA) and need to manage static resources effectively.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the Angel framework.
- **Static File Serving**: Efficiently serves static files from specified directories.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of routes and file serving behavior.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS platforms, making it versatile for mobile and web applications.

By leveraging the **angel3_static** package, developers can enhance their Flutter applications with robust static file serving capabilities, making it an essential tool for modern web development.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Angel3 Static

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **angel3_static** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **angel3_static** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  angel3_static: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Configuring for Android and iOS

### Android Configuration

1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions to allow access to local files:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have configured our project, we can start using the **angel3_static** package. Below is a simple example of how to set up a static file server in your Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:angel3_static/angel3_static.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Angel3 Static Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Angel3 Static Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Static File Server Running!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we set up a basic Flutter application with a simple UI. The **angel3_static** package will handle serving static files when configured properly.

# Complete Example of Angel3 Static

Hereâ€™s a complete example of a Flutter application using the **angel3_static** package to serve static files.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:angel3_static/angel3_static.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Angel3 Static Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Angel3 Static Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Start the static file server
              startStaticServer();
            },
            child: Text('Start Static Server'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void startStaticServer() {
    // Create an instance of the static file server
    final server = StaticFileServer();

    // Specify the directory to serve files from
    server.serveFilesFrom('assets/static');

    // Start the server
    server.start().then((_) {
      print('Static file server running at http://localhost:8080');
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton that, when pressed, calls the startStaticServer method.
// 4. The startStaticServer method creates an instance of StaticFileServer and specifies the directory to serve files from.
// 5. The server is started, and a message is printed to the console indicating the server's URL.
```

In this example, we have a button that, when pressed, starts a static file server serving files from the `assets/static` directory.
