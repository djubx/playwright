# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Persian DateTimePickers

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `persian_datetimepickers` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `persian_datetimepickers` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  persian_datetimepickers: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to set the minimum deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the Persian date and time pickers.

# Complete Example of Persian DateTimePickers

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:persian_datetimepickers/persian_datetimepickers.dart'; // Import the package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main app
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Persian DateTimePicker Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DatePickerDemo(), // Set the home widget
    );
  }
}

class DatePickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DatePickerDemoState createState() => _DatePickerDemoState();
}

class _DatePickerDemoState extends State<DatePickerDemo> {
  // Variables to hold selected date and time
  Jalali? selectedDate;
  TimeOfDay? selectedTime;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Persian DateTimePicker Demo'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display selected date
            Text(
              selectedDate != null
                  ? 'Selected Date: ${selectedDate!.toString()}'
                  : 'No Date Selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display selected time
            Text(
              selectedTime != null
                  ? 'Selected Time: ${selectedTime!.format(context)}'
                  : 'No Time Selected',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open date picker
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Show the Persian date picker
                Jalali? date = await showPersianDatePicker(
                  context: context,
                  initialDate: Jalali.now(),
                  firstDate: Jalali(1400, 1, 1),
                  lastDate: Jalali(1500, 12, 29),
                );
                setState(() {
                  selectedDate = date; // Update selected date
                });
              },
              child: Text('Select Date'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open time picker
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Show the time picker
                TimeOfDay? time = await showTimePicker(
                  context: context,
                  initialTime: TimeOfDay.now(),
                );
                setState(() {
                  selectedTime = time; // Update selected time
                });
              },
              child: Text('Select Time'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home widget is DatePickerDemo, which manages the state for selected date and time.
// 4. The UI displays the selected date and time, with buttons to open the respective pickers.
// 5. When the user taps the "Select Date" button, the Persian date picker is shown.
// 6. Upon selecting a date, the state is updated, and the selected date is displayed.
// 7. Similarly, tapping the "Select Time" button opens the time picker, and the selected time is displayed.
```
