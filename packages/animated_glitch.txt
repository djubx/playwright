# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Animated Glitch Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **animated_glitch** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_glitch: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Open the `Podfile` and uncomment the platform line, setting it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the glitch effect on a text widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_glitch/animated_glitch.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Glitch Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: GlitchText(
            'Glitch Effect!',
            style: TextStyle(
              fontSize: 40,
              color: Colors.white,
            ),
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Duration of the glitch effect
            glitchDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 100), // Duration of each glitch
            child: Text('Glitch Effect!'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that displays a text widget with a glitch effect. The `GlitchText` widget is used to wrap the text, and we can customize the duration of the glitch effect.

# Complete Example of Animated Glitch Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_glitch/animated_glitch.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Animated Glitch Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: GlitchText(
            'Glitch Effect!', // Text to display with glitch effect
            style: TextStyle(
              fontSize: 40, // Font size of the text
              color: Colors.white, // Color of the text
            ),
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Total duration of the glitch effect
            glitchDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 100), // Duration of each individual glitch
            child: Text('Glitch Effect!'), // Child widget to apply the glitch effect
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Animated Glitch Example".
// 5. The body of the Scaffold is centered, displaying a GlitchText widget.
// 6. The GlitchText widget takes a string and applies a glitch effect to it.
// 7. The duration and glitchDuration properties control how long the glitch effect lasts.
// 8. Finally, the runApp function is called to launch the application with the RealFlutter widget.
