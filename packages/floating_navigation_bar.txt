# Tutorial: Setting Up the Floating Navigation Bar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `floating_navigation_bar` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `floating_navigation_bar` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  floating_navigation_bar: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Install Packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for certain permissions if your app requires them. However, the `floating_navigation_bar` package does not require any specific permissions.

## Step 4: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's implement a basic floating navigation bar in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:floating_navigation_bar/floating_navigation_bar.dart';
```

2. Create a simple Flutter app with a floating navigation bar:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:floating_navigation_bar/floating_navigation_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _selectedIndex = 0;

  void _onItemTapped(int index) {
    setState(() {
      _selectedIndex = index;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Floating Navigation Bar Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Selected Index: $_selectedIndex'),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingNavigationBar(
        items: [
          FloatingNavigationBarItem(icon: Icons.home, label: 'Home'),
          FloatingNavigationBarItem(icon: Icons.search, label: 'Search'),
          FloatingNavigationBarItem(icon: Icons.settings, label: 'Settings'),
        ],
        currentIndex: _selectedIndex,
        onTap: _onItemTapped,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a floating navigation bar. The navigation bar contains three items: Home, Search, and Settings. Tapping on an item updates the selected index displayed in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of Floating Navigation Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:floating_navigation_bar/floating_navigation_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home to our main widget
    );
  }
}

// Main widget for the application
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

// State class for RealFlutter
class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _selectedIndex = 0; // Variable to track the selected index

  // Function to handle item taps
  void _onItemTapped(int index) {
    setState(() {
      _selectedIndex = index; // Update the selected index
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Floating Navigation Bar Example'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Selected Index: $_selectedIndex'), // Display selected index
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingNavigationBar(
        items: [
          FloatingNavigationBarItem(icon: Icons.home, label: 'Home'), // Home item
          FloatingNavigationBarItem(icon: Icons.search, label: 'Search'), // Search item
          FloatingNavigationBarItem(icon: Icons.settings, label: 'Settings'), // Settings item
        ],
        currentIndex: _selectedIndex, // Set the current index
        onTap: _onItemTapped, // Set the onTap function
      ),
    );
  }
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected index.
4. The _onItemTapped function updates the selected index when a navigation item is tapped.
5. The Scaffold widget contains an AppBar and a body that displays the currently selected index.
6. The FloatingNavigationBar is displayed as a floating action button, with three items: Home, Search, and Settings.
7. Tapping on an item updates the displayed index in the center of the screen.
