# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_barcode_sdk

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_barcode_sdk` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `flutter_barcode_sdk` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_barcode_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_barcode_sdk).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the camera permission in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for barcode scanning.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that we have set up the package, we can start using it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to implement barcode scanning.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_barcode_sdk/flutter_barcode_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Barcode SDK Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: BarcodeScannerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class BarcodeScannerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BarcodeScannerScreenState createState() => _BarcodeScannerScreenState();
}

class _BarcodeScannerScreenState extends State<BarcodeScannerScreen> {
  String _barcodeResult = "Scan a barcode";

  // Function to start scanning
  void _startScanning() async {
    // Initialize the barcode scanner
    final FlutterBarcodeSdk barcodeSdk = FlutterBarcodeSdk();

    // Start the scanning process
    String result = await barcodeSdk.scan();

    // Update the state with the scanned result
    setState(() {
      _barcodeResult = result;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Barcode Scanner'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              _barcodeResult,
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startScanning,
              child: Text('Start Scanning'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets BarcodeScannerScreen as the home.
// 3. BarcodeScannerScreen is a stateful widget that manages the scanning state.
// 4. When the user presses the "Start Scanning" button, the _startScanning function is called.
// 5. This function initializes the FlutterBarcodeSdk and calls the scan method, which opens the camera for scanning.
// 6. Once a barcode is scanned, the result is updated in the _barcodeResult state variable.
// 7. The scanned result is displayed on the screen, allowing the user to see the scanned barcode value.
```
