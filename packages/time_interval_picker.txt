# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Time Interval Picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **time_interval_picker** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **time_interval_picker** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  time_interval_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to request permission for notifications if your app uses them. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSLocalNotificationUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to notifications.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Time Interval Picker

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the time interval picker in a simple app.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:time_interval_picker/time_interval_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Time Interval Picker Example',
      home: TimeIntervalPickerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class TimeIntervalPickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TimeIntervalPickerDemoState createState() => _TimeIntervalPickerDemoState();
}

class _TimeIntervalPickerDemoState extends State<TimeIntervalPickerDemo> {
  // Variables to hold the selected start and end times
  TimeOfDay? startTime;
  TimeOfDay? endTime;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Time Interval Picker Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected start time
            Text(
              startTime != null ? 'Start Time: ${startTime!.format(context)}' : 'Select Start Time',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Display the selected end time
            Text(
              endTime != null ? 'End Time: ${endTime!.format(context)}' : 'Select End Time',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open the time interval picker
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                // Show the time interval picker
                final result = await showTimeIntervalPicker(
                  context: context,
                  initialStartTime: startTime,
                  initialEndTime: endTime,
                );

                // Update the state with the selected times
                if (result != null) {
                  setState(() {
                    startTime = result.startTime;
                    endTime = result.endTime;
                  });
                }
              },
              child: Text('Pick Time Interval'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the time_interval_picker package.
// The app consists of a main screen with two text widgets displaying the selected start and end times.
// When the user taps the "Pick Time Interval" button, the time interval picker dialog appears, allowing them to select a time range.
// After the user selects a time range, the selected start and end times are displayed on the screen.
```
<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the **time_interval_picker** package. The application consists of a main screen with two text widgets that display the selected start and end times. When the user taps the "Pick Time Interval" button, the time interval picker dialog appears, allowing them to select a time range. After the user selects a time range, the selected start and end times are displayed on the screen.

### Summary of Application Flow

- The app starts by running the `RealFlutter` class, which sets up the main material app.
- The `TimeIntervalPickerDemo` widget is displayed, which contains the UI for selecting time intervals.
- The user can tap the "Pick Time Interval" button to open the time interval picker.
- Upon selection, the start and end times are updated and displayed on the screen.

This structured approach provides a comprehensive overview of the **time_interval_picker** package, guiding users through its features, setup, and implementation in a Flutter application.
