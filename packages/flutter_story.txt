# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Story Package

## Installation

To get started with the `flutter_story` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_story: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_story).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

After making these changes, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `flutter_story` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_story/flutter_story.dart';
```

You can then create a simple story interface using the `RealFlutter` class. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Story Example')),
      body: StoryWidget(
        stories: [
          StoryItem(
            title: 'Story 1',
            media: 'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
          ),
          StoryItem(
            title: 'Story 2',
            media: 'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple story interface with two stories. You can customize the `StoryItem` with various media types and titles.

## Conclusion

The `flutter_story` package is a versatile tool for creating engaging story interfaces in Flutter applications. With its easy setup and customizable features, you can enhance user interaction and create a modern app experience.

# Complete Example of Using the Flutter Story Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_story/flutter_story.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Story Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Story Example')),
      body: StoryWidget(
        stories: [
          // First story item with an image
          StoryItem(
            title: 'Story 1',
            media: 'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
          ),
          // Second story item with another image
          StoryItem(
            title: 'Story 2',
            media: 'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
          ),
          // Third story item with a video
          StoryItem(
            title: 'Story 3',
            media: 'https://example.com/video1.mp4',
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a StoryWidget in the body.
// 4. The StoryWidget takes a list of StoryItem objects, each representing a story with a title and media.
// 5. Users can swipe through the stories, and the app handles the navigation and display of media automatically.
