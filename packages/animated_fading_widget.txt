# Complete Example of Animated Fading Widget

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_fading_widget/animated_fading_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Animated Fading Widget Demo',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // State variable to control the visibility of the text
  bool _isVisible = true;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Fading Widget Example')),
      body: Center(
        // Using AnimatedFadingWidget to fade the text in and out
        child: AnimatedFadingWidget(
          duration: Duration(seconds: 2), // Duration of the fade animation
          child: _isVisible
              ? Text('Hello, Flutter!', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24))
              : Container(), // Empty container when not visible
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _toggleVisibility, // Toggle visibility on button press
        child: Icon(Icons.play_arrow),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to toggle the visibility of the text
  void _toggleVisibility() {
    setState(() {
      _isVisible = !_isVisible; // Change the state to the opposite
    });
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which maintains the state of the text visibility.
// 3. The AnimatedFadingWidget is used to wrap the text, allowing it to fade in and out.
// 4. A FloatingActionButton is provided to toggle the visibility of the text.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the _toggleVisibility function is called, which updates the state.
// 6. The text fades out when _isVisible is false and fades in when it is true.
