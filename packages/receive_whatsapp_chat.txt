# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `receive_whatsapp_chat`

## Installation
To get started with the `receive_whatsapp_chat` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  receive_whatsapp_chat: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS"/>
```

3. Ensure that your app's `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to send images.</string>
```

## Using the Package
To use the package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:receive_whatsapp_chat/receive_whatsapp_chat.dart';
```

You can then initialize the package and set up a listener for incoming messages:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _message = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the WhatsApp message listener
    ReceiveWhatsAppChat.onMessageReceived.listen((message) {
      setState(() {
        _message = message; // Update the state with the received message
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('WhatsApp Chat Receiver')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(_message.isNotEmpty ? _message : 'No messages received yet.'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of `receive_whatsapp_chat`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:receive_whatsapp_chat/receive_whatsapp_chat.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _message = ''; // Variable to hold the received message

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the WhatsApp message listener
    ReceiveWhatsAppChat.onMessageReceived.listen((message) {
      setState(() {
        _message = message; // Update the state with the received message
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('WhatsApp Chat Receiver')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _message.isNotEmpty ? _message : 'No messages received yet.',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20), // Style the text
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp that hosts the RealFlutter widget.
// 3. In RealFlutter, we define a stateful widget to manage the state of received messages.
// 4. In the initState method, we set up a listener for incoming WhatsApp messages.
// 5. When a message is received, we update the _message variable and call setState to refresh the UI.
// 6. The build method displays the received message or a placeholder text if no messages have been received.
