// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, which creates a MaterialApp with a home screen.
// 2. The home screen is a Scaffold with a body that uses the RealFlutter class.
// 3. The RealFlutter class creates a TWContainer with a blue background and white text.
// 4. The TWContainer uses the TWColors class to access pre-defined colors.
// 5. The TWContainer uses the TWText class to create a text widget with pre-defined styles.
// 6. The TWText class uses the TWTextStyle class to access pre-defined text styles.

// In summary, the code flows by creating a MaterialApp with a home screen that uses the RealFlutter class. The RealFlutter class creates a TWContainer with pre-defined colors and text styles, which is then displayed on the screen.
