# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Phosphor Flutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **phosphor_flutter** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  phosphor_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:phosphor_flutter/phosphor_flutter.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using Icons in Your Application

You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Here’s how to use the `RealFlutter` class to display an icon:

### Example for Android and iOS

The usage is the same for both platforms. Here’s a simple example of how to use an icon in a Flutter application:

```dart
Icon(PhosphorIcons.heart, size: 50, color: Colors.red)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

- **Android**: Ensure that your Android project is set up to use the latest Flutter version. No additional configuration is needed for using icons.
- **iOS**: Similarly, for iOS, ensure that your project is updated. The icons will work seamlessly without any extra setup.

## Step 5: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons by changing their size and color. For example:

```dart
Icon(PhosphorIcons.user, size: 30, color: Colors.blue)
```

This will render a user icon with a size of 30 pixels and a blue color.

# Complete Example of Using Phosphor Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:phosphor_flutter/phosphor_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Phosphor Flutter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Phosphor Icons Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a heart icon
              Icon(PhosphorIcons.heart, size: 50, color: Colors.red),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a user icon
              Icon(PhosphorIcons.user, size: 50, color: Colors.blue),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a settings icon
              Icon(PhosphorIcons.gear, size: 50, color: Colors.green),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application, which calls runApp().
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget sets up the application with a title and a home screen.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the visual interface, including an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 6. A Column widget is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 7. Each Icon widget displays a different Phosphor icon with specified size and color.
// 8. SizedBox widgets are used to add spacing between the icons for better visual separation.
