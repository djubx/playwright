# Huawei ML Language Flutter Package

The **huawei_ml_language** Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to integrate Huawei's machine learning capabilities into their Flutter applications. This package provides functionalities for natural language processing (NLP), enabling features such as text recognition, language detection, and sentiment analysis. 

### When to Use This Package

You should consider using the **huawei_ml_language** package when you need to implement features that require understanding or processing human language. Some common use cases include:

- **Chatbots**: Enhance user interaction by understanding and responding to user queries.
- **Text Analysis**: Analyze user-generated content for sentiment or intent.
- **Language Translation**: Automatically detect and translate text in different languages.

### Features

- **Language Detection**: Automatically identify the language of a given text.
- **Text Recognition**: Extract text from images or documents.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a given text.
- **Multi-language Support**: Supports various languages, making it versatile for global applications.

Overall, the **huawei_ml_language** package is an essential tool for developers looking to leverage machine learning for language processing in their Flutter applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Huawei ML Language Package

### Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **huawei_ml_language** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  huawei_ml_language: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/huawei_ml_language).

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration

1. **Update Android Manifest**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
   ```

2. **Add Huawei Services**: Ensure you have the Huawei services configured in your project. You will need to add the `agconnect-services.json` file to your `android/app` directory. This file can be obtained from the Huawei Developer Console after creating a project.

#### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the camera for text recognition.</string>
   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the photo library for text recognition.</string>
   ```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed and run `pod install` in the `ios` directory.

### Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement language detection and sentiment analysis.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:huawei_ml_language/huawei_ml_language.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Huawei ML Language Example',
      home: LanguageDetectionScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class LanguageDetectionScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LanguageDetectionScreenState createState() => _LanguageDetectionScreenState();
}

class _LanguageDetectionScreenState extends State<LanguageDetectionScreen> {
  String _detectedLanguage = '';
  String _sentimentResult = '';

  // Function to detect language
  Future<void> _detectLanguage(String text) async {
    try {
      // Create a LanguageDetector instance
      final languageDetector = MLLanguageDetector();
      // Detect the language of the input text
      final result = await languageDetector.detectLanguage(text);
      setState(() {
        _detectedLanguage = result.language;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error detecting language: $e');
    }
  }

  // Function to analyze sentiment
  Future<void> _analyzeSentiment(String text) async {
    try {
      // Create a SentimentAnalyzer instance
      final sentimentAnalyzer = MLSentimentAnalyzer();
      // Analyze the sentiment of the input text
      final result = await sentimentAnalyzer.analyzeSentiment(text);
      setState(() {
        _sentimentResult = result.sentiment;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error analyzing sentiment: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Huawei ML Language Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              onSubmitted: (text) {
                // Call language detection and sentiment analysis on text submission
                _detectLanguage(text);
                _analyzeSentiment(text);
              },
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter text',
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Detected Language: $_detectedLanguage'),
            Text('Sentiment: $_sentimentResult'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The LanguageDetectionScreen is a stateful widget that manages the state of detected language and sentiment.
// 4. When the user submits text in the TextField, the _detectLanguage and _analyzeSentiment methods are called.
// 5. These methods create instances of MLLanguageDetector and MLSentimentAnalyzer, respectively, and call their respective methods to process the input text.
// 6. The results are displayed on the screen, showing the detected language and sentiment analysis results.
```
