# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the QR Code Tools Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `qr_code_tools` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  qr_code_tools: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/qr_code_tools).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the camera. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you need to add a description for camera usage in your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`. Add the following key-value pair:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera to scan QR codes.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to generate and scan QR codes.

# Complete Example of Using QR Code Tools

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:qr_code_tools/qr_code_tools.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'QR Code Tools Example',
      home: QRCodeHome(),
    );
  }
}

class QRCodeHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _QRCodeHomeState createState() => _QRCodeHomeState();
}

class _QRCodeHomeState extends State<QRCodeHome> {
  String _qrCodeData = "Scan a QR code!";
  String _generatedQRCode = "";

  // Function to generate QR code
  void _generateQRCode(String data) async {
    // Generate QR code from the provided data
    String qrCode = await QrCodeTools.generate(data);
    setState(() {
      _generatedQRCode = qrCode; // Update the generated QR code
    });
  }

  // Function to scan QR code
  void _scanQRCode() async {
    // Start scanning for QR codes
    String scannedData = await QrCodeTools.scan();
    setState(() {
      _qrCodeData = scannedData; // Update the scanned data
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('QR Code Tools Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Generated QR Code:'),
            // Display the generated QR code
            if (_generatedQRCode.isNotEmpty)
              Image.memory(base64Decode(_generatedQRCode)),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Scanned QR Code Data: $_qrCodeData'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _generateQRCode("Hello, QR Code!"),
              child: Text('Generate QR Code'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _scanQRCode,
              child: Text('Scan QR Code'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts by running the `RealFlutter` class, which sets up the main MaterialApp.
// The `QRCodeHome` widget is displayed, containing buttons to generate and scan QR codes.
// When the "Generate QR Code" button is pressed, the `_generateQRCode` function is called,
// which generates a QR code from the string "Hello, QR Code!" and updates the state to display it.
// When the "Scan QR Code" button is pressed, the `_scanQRCode` function is called,
// which opens the camera to scan a QR code and updates the state with the scanned data.
// The generated QR code and scanned data are displayed on the screen.
