# Setting Up shadcn_flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `shadcn_flutter` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `shadcn_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  shadcn_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter and the `shadcn_flutter` package. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using its features:

```dart
import 'package:shadcn_flutter/shadcn_flutter.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using shadcn_flutter Widgets

You can now start using the widgets provided by the `shadcn_flutter` package in your Flutter application. For example, you can create a simple UI with a custom button and a text field.

```dart
// Example usage of shadcn_flutter widgets
CustomButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  child: Text('Click Me'),
);
```

With these steps, you are now ready to build your application using the `shadcn_flutter` package!

# Complete Example of shadcn_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:shadcn_flutter/shadcn_flutter.dart'; // Importing the shadcn_flutter package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'shadcn_flutter Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue, // Setting the primary color for the app
      ),
      home: HomePage(), // Setting the home page of the app
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('shadcn_flutter Demo'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to shadcn_flutter!', // Welcome message
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Text style
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between widgets
            CustomButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action to perform on button press
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Button Pressed'), // Dialog title
                    content: Text('You pressed the button!'), // Dialog content
                    actions: <Widget>[
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () {
                          Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                        },
                        child: Text('OK'), // Button text
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Press Me'), // Button label
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. HomePage contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the Text and CustomButton vertically.
// 6. When the button is pressed, an AlertDialog is shown, confirming the button press.
```
