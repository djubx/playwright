// This code creates a basic Flutter app with a Persian theme and calendar integration.
// It displays the current Persian date and allows the user to input Persian numbers.
// The app uses the `persian_flutter` package to work with Persian text, dates, and numbers.

// The app's flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a Material Design interface.
// 2. The app displays the current Persian date using the `PersianDate` class.
// 3. The user can input Persian numbers using the `PersianNumberInputField` widget.
// 4. The app prints the input value to the console.

// Overall, this code demonstrates the basic usage of the `persian_flutter` package and its features.
