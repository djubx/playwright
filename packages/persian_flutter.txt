# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `persian_flutter`

## Installation
To add the `persian_flutter` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  persian_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/persian_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the correct configurations for supporting RTL layouts. You may need to set the `android:layoutDirection` attribute in your XML layouts.
2. Add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml` to support RTL:

```xml
<application
    android:label="your_app_name"
    android:allowBackup="true"
    android:supportsRtl="true">
```

### iOS
1. In your `Info.plist`, add the following to support RTL:

```xml
<key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>
<false/>
<key>UISupportedInterfaceOrientations</key>
<array>
    <string>UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait</string>
</array>
```

## Using the Package
Once installed, you can start using the `persian_flutter` package in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:persian_flutter/persian_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Persian Flutter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Persian Flutter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: PersianText(
            'سلام دنیا', // "Hello World" in Persian
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays "سلام دنیا" (Hello World) in Persian using the `PersianText` widget provided by the package.

# Complete Example of `persian_flutter`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:persian_flutter/persian_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Persian Flutter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Persian Flutter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: PersianText(
            'سلام دنیا', // Displaying "Hello World" in Persian
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Setting the text size
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class extends StatelessWidget, which means it is immutable and can be rebuilt.
// 3. The MaterialApp widget is the root of the application, providing material design styling.
// 4. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the visual interface, including an AppBar and body.
// 5. The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// 6. The body contains a Center widget that centers its child widget.
// 7. The PersianText widget is used to display Persian text, ensuring proper formatting and RTL support.
// 8. The text "سلام دنیا" is displayed in the center of the screen with a font size of 24.
