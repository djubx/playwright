# Object 3D Flutter Package
The `object_3d` Flutter package is a powerful tool for rendering 3D objects in Flutter applications. It provides a simple and intuitive API for loading and displaying 3D models, allowing developers to create immersive and interactive 3D experiences.

## When to Use
The `object_3d` package is ideal for applications that require 3D rendering, such as:

* 3D modeling and animation
* Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) experiences
* 3D games and simulations
* Architectural and product visualizations

## Features
The `object_3d` package offers a range of features, including:

* Support for loading 3D models in various formats (e.g., OBJ, STL, GLTF)
* Real-time rendering and animation
* Lighting and shading effects
* Camera controls and navigation
* Integration with Flutter's gesture recognition system

# Setting Up the Object 3D Package
To use the `object_3d` package in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  object_3d: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:object_3d/object_3d.dart';
```
### Platform-Specific Details
#### Android
To use the `object_3d` package on Android, you need to add the following lines to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<uses-feature android:glEsVersion="0x00020000" android:required="true" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
```
#### iOS
To use the `object_3d` package on iOS, you need to add the following lines to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities</key>
<array>
    <string>gles-2</string>
</array>
```
### Configurations and Optimizations
To optimize the performance of the `object_3d` package, you can adjust the following settings:

* `renderMode`: Set to `RenderMode.software` for software rendering or `RenderMode.hardware` for hardware rendering.
* `antialiasing`: Set to `true` to enable antialiasing.
* `shadowMapResolution`: Set to a higher value to improve shadow quality.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:object_3d/object_3d.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create a 3D object
  Object3D _object3D;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load a 3D model
    _object3D = Object3D(
      'assets/model.obj',
      scale: 1.0,
      rotation: Vector3(0, 0, 0),
      translation: Vector3(0, 0, 0),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Object 3D Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Object3DView(
          _object3D,
          // Set camera controls
          camera: Camera(
            position: Vector3(0, 0, 5),
            lookAt: Vector3(0, 0, 0),
          ),
          // Set lighting
          lighting: Lighting(
            ambient: Color(0xFF333333),
            diffuse: Color(0xFF666666),
            specular: Color(0xFF999999),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The app starts and loads a 3D model.
// 2. The 3D model is displayed on the screen.
// 3. The user can rotate and zoom the 3D model using gestures.
// 4. The app updates the 3D model's rotation and translation based on user input.
// 5. The app renders the 3D model in real-time.

// Summary:
// This code demonstrates how to use the `object_3d` package to load and display a 3D model.
// It also shows how to set up camera controls and lighting.
// The app updates the 3D model's rotation and translation based on user input and renders the 3D model in real-time.
