## Setup Process

To get started with the `downloadsfolder` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Dependency

Add the `downloadsfolder` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  downloadsfolder: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

### Step 2: Install the Package

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access external storage. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

#### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add a usage description for accessing the file system. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to the photo library.</string>
```

### Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:downloadsfolder/downloadsfolder.dart';
```

## Using the Package

Once you have set up the package, you can use it to access the downloads folder. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to retrieve the path to the downloads directory:

```dart
void getDownloadsFolderPath() async {
  String downloadsPath = await DownloadsFolder.downloadsFolder;
  print("Downloads Folder Path: $downloadsPath");
}
```

This function retrieves the path to the downloads folder and prints it to the console.

# Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:downloadsfolder/downloadsfolder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Downloads Folder Example',
      home: DownloadsFolderExample(),
    );
  }
}

class DownloadsFolderExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DownloadsFolderExampleState createState() => _DownloadsFolderExampleState();
}

class _DownloadsFolderExampleState extends State<DownloadsFolderExample> {
  String _downloadsPath = "Unknown";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _getDownloadsFolderPath(); // Call the function to get the downloads folder path
  }

  // Function to get the downloads folder path
  void _getDownloadsFolderPath() async {
    String downloadsPath = await DownloadsFolder.downloadsFolder; // Retrieve the downloads folder path
    setState(() {
      _downloadsPath = downloadsPath; // Update the state with the downloads path
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Downloads Folder Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Downloads Folder Path: $_downloadsPath'), // Display the downloads folder path
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (DownloadsFolderExample).
// 3. The DownloadsFolderExample widget is a stateful widget that manages the state of the downloads folder path.
// 4. In the initState() method, _getDownloadsFolderPath() is called to retrieve the path to the downloads folder.
// 5. The _getDownloadsFolderPath() function uses the DownloadsFolder.downloadsFolder method to get the path asynchronously.
// 6. Once the path is retrieved, setState() is called to update the _downloadsPath variable, which triggers a rebuild of the widget.
// 7. The build method displays the downloads folder path in the center of the screen.
