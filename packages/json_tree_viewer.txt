# Exploring the json_tree_viewer Flutter Package

The `json_tree_viewer` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers who need to visualize JSON data in a structured and user-friendly manner. This package is particularly useful when working with APIs that return complex JSON responses, allowing developers to easily inspect and debug the data.

## When to Use This Package
- **API Development**: When developing applications that consume APIs, visualizing the JSON response can help in understanding the data structure.
- **Debugging**: It aids in debugging by providing a clear view of the JSON data being processed.
- **Data Representation**: When you need to display JSON data in a hierarchical format within your app.

## Key Features
- **Tree View Representation**: Displays JSON data in a collapsible tree format, making it easy to navigate through nested structures.
- **Customizable**: Offers options to customize the appearance of the tree view to fit your app's design.
- **Interactive**: Users can expand and collapse nodes to explore the data dynamically.

Overall, the `json_tree_viewer` package simplifies the process of working with JSON data in Flutter applications, making it an essential tool for developers dealing with complex data structures.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using json_tree_viewer

## Installation
To get started with the `json_tree_viewer` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  json_tree_viewer: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/json_tree_viewer).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `json_tree_viewer` package works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up correctly for both platforms. You may need to configure your Android and iOS projects to support the latest Flutter features.

### Android Configuration
- Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.

### iOS Configuration
- Make sure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Using the Package
To use the `json_tree_viewer` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:json_tree_viewer/json_tree_viewer.dart';
```

You can then create a widget that displays your JSON data. The package provides a `JsonTreeViewer` widget that takes a JSON object and renders it in a tree format.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `JsonTreeViewer` widget:

```dart
JsonTreeViewer(
  json: yourJsonData,
)
```

Replace `yourJsonData` with the actual JSON object you want to visualize.

With this setup, you are ready to start visualizing JSON data in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of json_tree_viewer in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:json_tree_viewer/json_tree_viewer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample JSON data to visualize
    final Map<String, dynamic> jsonData = {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "age": 30,
      "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Anytown",
        "state": "CA"
      },
      "phones": ["123-456-7890", "987-654-3210"]
    };

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'JSON Tree Viewer Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('JSON Tree Viewer'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: JsonTreeViewer(
            json: jsonData, // Pass the JSON data to the viewer
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'JSON Tree Viewer'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is a Padding widget that adds some space around the JsonTreeViewer.
// 5. The JsonTreeViewer widget is initialized with the sample JSON data, which is displayed in a tree format.
// 6. Users can interact with the tree view to expand or collapse nodes, making it easy to explore the JSON structure.
