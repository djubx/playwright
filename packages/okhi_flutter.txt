# Setting Up the okhi_flutter Package

## Installation
To get started with the `okhi_flutter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  okhi_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/okhi_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

3. Ensure that you have the Google Maps API key configured if you are using the map features.

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide better services.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `okhi_flutter` package, you will typically create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and call its methods to capture and validate addresses. 

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize and use the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:okhi_flutter/okhi_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('OkHi Flutter Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the address picker
              OkHi.showAddressPicker(context);
            },
            child: Text('Pick Address'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application with a button that, when pressed, opens the address picker provided by the `okhi_flutter` package.

# Complete Example of Using okhi_flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:okhi_flutter/okhi_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('OkHi Flutter Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Trigger the address picker and await the result
              final address = await OkHi.showAddressPicker(context);
              
              // Check if an address was selected
              if (address != null) {
                // Display the selected address
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                    title: Text('Selected Address'),
                    content: Text(address.toString()),
                    actions: [
                      TextButton(
                        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
                        child: Text('OK'),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Pick Address'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'OkHi Flutter Example'.
// 4. The body contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it calls OkHi.showAddressPicker(context) to open the address picker.
// 6. The selected address is awaited and stored in the 'address' variable.
// 7. If an address is selected (not null), an AlertDialog is shown displaying the selected address.
// 8. The user can dismiss the dialog by pressing the 'OK' button.
