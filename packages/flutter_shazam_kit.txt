# flutter_shazam_kit: Setup and Usage Tutorial

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_shazam_kit` package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_shazam_kit` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_shazam_kit: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_shazam_kit).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following keys to request microphone access:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to identify music.</string>
<key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your music library to provide better recommendations.</string>
```

2. Ensure that your deployment target is set to iOS 15.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '15.0'
```

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

2. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_shazam_kit/flutter_shazam_kit.dart';
```

2. Initialize the ShazamKit and start recognizing music:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  ShazamKit _shazamKit = ShazamKit();
  String _recognizedTrack = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _startListening();
  }

  void _startListening() async {
    await _shazamKit.startListening();
    _shazamKit.onTrackRecognized.listen((track) {
      setState(() {
        _recognizedTrack = track.title; // Update the UI with the recognized track
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _shazamKit.stopListening();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Music Recognizer')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(_recognizedTrack.isNotEmpty ? 'Recognized: $_recognizedTrack' : 'Listening...'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, we initialize the `ShazamKit`, start listening for music, and update the UI with the recognized track title.

# Complete Example of flutter_shazam_kit

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_shazam_kit/flutter_shazam_kit.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of ShazamKit
  ShazamKit _shazamKit = ShazamKit();
  String _recognizedTrack = ''; // Variable to hold the recognized track title

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _startListening(); // Start listening for music when the app initializes
  }

  void _startListening() async {
    // Start the music recognition process
    await _shazamKit.startListening();
    // Listen for recognized tracks
    _shazamKit.onTrackRecognized.listen((track) {
      setState(() {
        _recognizedTrack = track.title; // Update the recognized track title
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _shazamKit.stopListening(); // Stop listening when the widget is disposed
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Music Recognizer')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _recognizedTrack.isNotEmpty ? 'Recognized: $_recognizedTrack' : 'Listening...',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(), // Run the RealFlutter widget
  ));
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. In the initState method, we call _startListening to begin recognizing music.
// 3. The _startListening method starts the ShazamKit listening process.
// 4. When a track is recognized, the onTrackRecognized stream emits the track data.
// 5. We update the UI with the recognized track title using setState.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, we stop listening to free up resources.
```
