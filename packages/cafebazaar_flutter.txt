# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Cafebazaar Flutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `cafebazaar_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cafebazaar_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/cafebazaar_flutter).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="cafebazaar_app_id"
            android:value="YOUR_CAFEBAZAAR_APP_ID" />
    </application>

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
</manifest>
```

Replace `YOUR_CAFEBAZAAR_APP_ID` with your actual Cafebazaar app ID.

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `build.gradle` file is set up correctly. In `android/app/build.gradle`, make sure you have the following:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
        targetSdkVersion 30 // or higher
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: For iOS, you need to add the following to your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed and run `pod install` in the `ios` directory.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement in-app purchases.

# Complete Example of Cafebazaar Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cafebazaar_flutter/cafebazaar_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cafebazaar Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  String _purchaseStatus = 'No purchases yet';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize Cafebazaar SDK
    CafebazaarFlutter.initialize();
  }

  // Function to handle in-app purchase
  void _buyProduct() async {
    try {
      // Attempt to purchase a product
      final result = await CafebazaarFlutter.buy('your_product_id');
      setState(() {
        _purchaseStatus = result ? 'Purchase successful!' : 'Purchase failed!';
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _purchaseStatus = 'Error: $e';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Cafebazaar Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Purchase Status:',
            ),
            Text(
              _purchaseStatus,
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _buyProduct,
              child: Text('Buy Product'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home page as HomePage.
// 3. In HomePage, we initialize the Cafebazaar SDK in initState.
// 4. The _buyProduct function is called when the user presses the "Buy Product" button.
// 5. This function attempts to purchase a product using Cafebazaar's buy method.
// 6. The purchase status is updated based on the result of the purchase attempt.
// 7. The UI displays the current purchase status to the user.
```
