# Overview of the `scroll_snap_list` Flutter Package

The `scroll_snap_list` package is a powerful Flutter library designed to create scrollable lists that snap to specific items as the user scrolls. This feature enhances the user experience by providing a more controlled and visually appealing way to navigate through lists, especially when dealing with large datasets or image galleries.

## When to Use `scroll_snap_list`

You might consider using the `scroll_snap_list` package in scenarios such as:

- **Image Galleries**: When displaying a series of images where you want each image to snap into place as the user scrolls.
- **Product Listings**: In e-commerce applications, where users can scroll through product images or details and want a clear focus on one item at a time.
- **Onboarding Screens**: For applications that require users to swipe through multiple onboarding screens, snapping to each screen can improve the flow.

## Features

- **Snap to Item**: Automatically snaps the scroll position to the nearest item.
- **Customizable Item Size**: Allows developers to define the size of each item in the list.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Provides a smooth scrolling experience, enhancing the overall UI.
- **Flexible Layout**: Supports various layouts, making it adaptable to different design requirements.

Overall, the `scroll_snap_list` package is an excellent choice for developers looking to implement a snapping scroll effect in their Flutter applications, providing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `scroll_snap_list`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `scroll_snap_list` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scroll_snap_list: ^0.3.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the platform version in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:scroll_snap_list/scroll_snap_list.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `ScrollSnapList` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ScrollSnapList(
  itemBuilder: (context, index) => YourCustomWidget(index),
  itemCount: yourItemCount,
  itemSize: 200.0, // Set the size of each item
  onItemFocus: (index) => print('Focused on item: $index'),
)
```

This basic setup will create a scrollable list where each item snaps into place as you scroll.

## Conclusion

The `scroll_snap_list` package is easy to set up and provides a great way to enhance the user experience in your Flutter applications. With its customizable features and smooth scrolling capabilities, it is a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit.

# Complete Example of Using `scroll_snap_list`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scroll_snap_list/scroll_snap_list.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scroll Snap List Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  // Define the number of items in the list
  final int itemCount = 10;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Scroll Snap List Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ScrollSnapList(
          itemBuilder: (context, index) => _buildItem(index),
          itemCount: itemCount,
          itemSize: 200.0, // Set the size of each item
          onItemFocus: (index) => print('Focused on item: $index'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to build each item in the list
  Widget _buildItem(int index) {
    return Container(
      width: 200.0,
      height: 200.0,
      color: Colors.blue[(index + 1) * 100], // Different shades of blue
      child: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Item $index',
          style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. Inside the body, a ScrollSnapList is created with a specified item count and size.
// 5. The itemBuilder method (_buildItem) creates a container for each item with a unique color and text.
// 6. As the user scrolls, the list snaps to each item, providing a smooth and engaging experience.
