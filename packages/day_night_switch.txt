# Tutorial: Setting Up the Day Night Switch Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **day_night_switch** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **day_night_switch** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  day_night_switch: ^0.0.3  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode, and ensure that the project settings are configured to support Swift.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:day_night_switch/day_night_switch.dart';
```

You can now create a simple toggle switch in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```dart
bool isDarkMode = false; // State variable to track the theme

DayNightSwitch(
  value: isDarkMode,
  onChanged: (value) {
    setState(() {
      isDarkMode = value; // Update the state when the switch is toggled
    });
  },
)
```

This code snippet creates a toggle switch that updates the `isDarkMode` variable whenever the user interacts with it.

## Conclusion

You have now successfully set up the **day_night_switch** package in your Flutter application. You can customize the switch further to fit your app's design and functionality.

# Complete Example of Day Night Switch

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:day_night_switch/day_night_switch.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // State variable to track whether dark mode is enabled
  bool isDarkMode = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      // Set the theme based on the isDarkMode variable
      theme: isDarkMode ? ThemeData.dark() : ThemeData.light(),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Day Night Switch Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display the DayNightSwitch widget
              DayNightSwitch(
                value: isDarkMode,
                onChanged: (value) {
                  // Update the state when the switch is toggled
                  setState(() {
                    isDarkMode = value;
                  });
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display a message based on the current theme
              Text(
                isDarkMode ? 'Night Mode' : 'Day Mode',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the theme.
// 3. The _RealFlutterState class contains a boolean variable isDarkMode to track the current theme.
// 4. The build method returns a MaterialApp with a theme based on the isDarkMode variable.
// 5. The DayNightSwitch widget is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 6. When the switch is toggled, the onChanged callback updates the isDarkMode variable and calls setState to rebuild the UI.
// 7. A Text widget displays the current mode (Day or Night) based on the isDarkMode variable.
