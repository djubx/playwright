# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using sunmi_scanner

## Installation
To get started with the `sunmi_scanner` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sunmi_scanner: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/sunmi_scanner).

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions for camera access:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

2. **Hardware Configuration**: If you are using a Sunmi device, ensure that the device is properly configured to allow barcode scanning.

### iOS
1. **Permissions**: Add the following key to your `Info.plist` to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for scanning barcodes.</string>
```

## Using the Package
Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement barcode scanning.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sunmi_scanner/sunmi_scanner.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String scannedData = "Scan a barcode";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the scanner
    SunmiScanner.startScan((data) {
      // Update the scanned data when a barcode is scanned
      setState(() {
        scannedData = data;
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop the scanner when the widget is disposed
    SunmiScanner.stopScan();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Sunmi Scanner Example"),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          scannedData,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of sunmi_scanner

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sunmi_scanner/sunmi_scanner.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String scannedData = "Scan a barcode"; // Variable to hold scanned data

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start the scanner and listen for scanned data
    SunmiScanner.startScan((data) {
      // Update the scanned data when a barcode is scanned
      setState(() {
        scannedData = data; // Update the UI with the scanned data
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Stop the scanner when the widget is disposed
    SunmiScanner.stopScan(); // Clean up resources
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Sunmi Scanner Example"), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          scannedData, // Display the scanned data
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24), // Text style
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the initState method, the scanner is started, and it listens for scanned data.
// 3. When a barcode is scanned, the callback updates the scannedData variable.
// 4. The UI is rebuilt to display the new scanned data.
// 5. When the widget is disposed, the scanner is stopped to free up resources.
