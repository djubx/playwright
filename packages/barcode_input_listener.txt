// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user clicks the "Scan Barcode" button, which starts the scanning process.
// 2. The `BarcodeListener` instance is created and set up to listen for barcode input.
// 3. When a barcode is scanned, the `onBarcodeScanned` callback is called with the barcode data.
// 4. The barcode data is processed and displayed on the screen.
// 5. The user can repeat the scanning process by clicking the "Scan Barcode" button again.
