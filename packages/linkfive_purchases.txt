    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.android.vending.billingclient.api.BillingClient"

```

2. **App Store Connect**: Configure your in-app purchases in App Store Connect.

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured your platforms, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize the package and make a purchase.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:linkfive_purchases/linkfive_purchases.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the purchases
    LinkfivePurchases.initialize();
  }

  void _makePurchase(String productId) async {
    try {
      // Attempt to make a purchase
      final purchase = await LinkfivePurchases.purchase(productId);
      // Handle successful purchase
      print('Purchase successful: $purchase');
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle error
      print('Error making purchase: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('In-App Purchases')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => _makePurchase('your_product_id'),
          child: Text('Buy Product'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the `linkfive_purchases` package and provides a button to make a purchase. Replace `'your_product_id'` with the actual product ID you set up in your app store.

# Complete Example of linkfive_purchases

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:linkfive_purchases/linkfive_purchases.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the purchases when the app starts
    LinkfivePurchases.initialize();
  }

  void _makePurchase(String productId) async {
    try {
      // Attempt to make a purchase with the given product ID
      final purchase = await LinkfivePurchases.purchase(productId);
      // If successful, print the purchase details
      print('Purchase successful: $purchase');
    } catch (e) {
      // If there's an error, print the error message
      print('Error making purchase: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('In-App Purchases')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => _makePurchase('your_product_id'), // Trigger purchase on button press
          child: Text('Buy Product'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. In the initState method, the LinkfivePurchases package is initialized.
// 3. The build method creates a simple UI with an AppBar and a button.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the _makePurchase method is called with the product ID.
// 5. The _makePurchase method attempts to make a purchase and handles success or error accordingly.
// 6. If the purchase is successful, it prints the purchase details; if it fails, it prints the error message.
