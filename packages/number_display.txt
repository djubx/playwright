# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Number Display Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **number_display** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  number_display: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to format and display numbers.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:number_display/number_display.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: NumberDisplayExample(),
    );
  }
}

class NumberDisplayExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a display formatter
    final display = createDisplay();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Number Display Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Formatted Number: ${display(1234567.89)}'), // Display formatted number
            Text('Currency: ${display(1234567.89, currency: true)}'), // Display as currency
            Text('Percentage: ${display(0.1234, percent: true)}'), // Display as percentage
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app that demonstrates how to format numbers using the **number_display** package. The `createDisplay` function is used to create a formatter that can be customized for different formats.

# Complete Example: Number Display in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:number_display/number_display.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: NumberDisplayExample(),
    );
  }
}

class NumberDisplayExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a display formatter
    final display = createDisplay();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Number Display Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display a formatted number
            Text('Formatted Number: ${display(1234567.89)}'), // Displays: 1,234,567.89
            // Display the number as currency
            Text('Currency: ${display(1234567.89, currency: true)}'), // Displays: $1,234,567.89
            // Display the number as a percentage
            Text('Percentage: ${display(0.1234, percent: true)}'), // Displays: 12.34%
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a home set to NumberDisplayExample.
// 3. NumberDisplayExample is another StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 4. Inside the build method, we create a display formatter using createDisplay().
// 5. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. The Center widget contains a Column that aligns its children vertically.
// 7. Each Text widget displays a formatted number using the display formatter.
// 8. The formatted number, currency, and percentage are displayed in the center of the screen.
```
