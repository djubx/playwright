# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Date Picker Timetable Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `date_picker_timetable` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  date_picker_timetable: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if your app requires access to the user's calendar or notifications. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your calendar.</string>
<key>NSRemindersUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your reminders.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `date_picker_timetable` in your app.

# Complete Example of Using Date Picker Timetable

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:date_picker_timetable/date_picker_timetable.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Date Picker Timetable Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: DatePickerExample(),
    );
  }
}

class DatePickerExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _DatePickerExampleState createState() => _DatePickerExampleState();
}

class _DatePickerExampleState extends State<DatePickerExample> {
  // Variable to hold selected dates
  List<DateTime> selectedDates = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Date Picker Timetable'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Date Picker Timetable widget
          DatePickerTimetable(
            initialSelectedDates: selectedDates,
            onDateSelected: (dates) {
              // Update the selected dates when the user selects new dates
              setState(() {
                selectedDates = dates;
              });
            },
            // Define the time slots available for selection
            timeSlots: [
              TimeSlot(start: TimeOfDay(hour: 9, minute: 0), end: TimeOfDay(hour: 17, minute: 0)),
            ],
          ),
          // Display selected dates
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: selectedDates.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text('Selected Date: ${selectedDates[index].toLocal()}'),
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home of the app is set to DatePickerExample, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 4. In the DatePickerExample state, we maintain a list of selected dates.
// 5. The DatePickerTimetable widget is displayed, allowing users to select dates and times.
// 6. When dates are selected, the onDateSelected callback updates the selectedDates state.
// 7. The selected dates are displayed in a ListView below the date picker.
// 8. The app is responsive and updates the UI as users interact with the date picker.
```
