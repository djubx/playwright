# Debug Console Flutter Package

The `debug_console` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for easy debugging and logging of messages directly within the app. This package is particularly useful during the development phase, as it provides a console-like interface to view logs, errors, and other debug information without needing to rely solely on the terminal or IDE output.

## When to Use This Package
- **Debugging**: When you need to track down issues in your Flutter application.
- **Logging**: To log messages, errors, and other information in a user-friendly manner.
- **Development**: During the development phase to monitor the app's behavior in real-time.

## Features
- **Real-time Logging**: View logs in real-time as they are generated.
- **Customizable Output**: Customize the appearance and behavior of the console.
- **Error Tracking**: Easily track and display errors that occur during runtime.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple interface for developers to interact with logs.

# Setting Up the Debug Console Package

To get started with the `debug_console` package, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `debug_console` package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     debug_console: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/debug_console).

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
- Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if you plan to log sensitive information. Typically, no additional configuration is required for basic usage.

### iOS
- For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you are logging any sensitive data.

## Basic Usage

To use the `debug_console` package, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Here’s a simple setup:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:debug_console/debug_console.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In your `RealFlutter` class, you can initialize the debug console:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize the debug console
    DebugConsole.init();

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Debug Console Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Log a message when the button is pressed
              DebugConsole.log('Button Pressed!');
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This basic setup will allow you to log messages to the debug console when the button is pressed.

# Complete Example of Using Debug Console

Here’s a complete example of a Flutter application that utilizes the `debug_console` package. This example demonstrates how to log messages and errors effectively.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:debug_console/debug_console.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Initialize the debug console
    DebugConsole.init();

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Debug Console Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Log a message when the button is pressed
                  DebugConsole.log('Button Pressed!');
                },
                child: Text('Press Me'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Log an error message
                  try {
                    throw Exception('This is a test error!');
                  } catch (e) {
                    DebugConsole.error(e.toString());
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Trigger Error'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. The RealFlutter class initializes the debug console.
// 3. The app displays a simple UI with two buttons.
// 4. When the "Press Me" button is pressed, a log message is sent to the debug console.
// 5. When the "Trigger Error" button is pressed, an exception is thrown and caught, 
//    and the error message is logged to the debug console.
```
