// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The `main` function is called, which initializes the debug console.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget is created and built.
// 3. The debug console is used to print a debug message when the widget is built.
// 4. A Scaffold with a button is created and displayed.
// 5. When the button is pressed, the debug console is used to print a message.
// This demonstrates the basic usage of the `debug_console` package in a Flutter app.
