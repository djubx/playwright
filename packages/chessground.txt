**Setting Up the Chessground Flutter Package**
---------------------------------------------

To use the Chessground Flutter package in your project, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  chessground: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:chessground/chessground.dart';
```

### Step 3: Create a Chessground Widget

Create a `Chessground` widget and add it to your app's widget tree:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: Chessground(
          size: 400,
          theme: ChessgroundTheme.defaultTheme,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Configure the Chessground Widget

Customize the `Chessground` widget by setting various properties, such as the game mode, piece set, and board theme:

```dart
Chessground(
  size: 400,
  theme: ChessgroundTheme.defaultTheme,
  gameMode: GameMode.casual,
  pieceSet: PieceSet.defaultSet,
  boardTheme: BoardTheme.defaultTheme,
)
```

### Step 5: Handle User Interactions

Use the `onMove` callback to handle user interactions, such as piece movements:

```dart
Chessground(
  size: 400,
  theme: ChessgroundTheme.defaultTheme,
  onMove: (move) {
    print('User moved piece from ${move.from} to ${move.to}');
  },
)
```

                DropdownMenuItem(
                  child: Text('Casual'),
                  value: GameMode.casual,
                ),

                setState(() {
                  _pieceSet = value;
                });
              },
              items: [
                DropdownMenuItem(
                  child: Text('Default'),
                  value: PieceSet.defaultSet,
                ),
                DropdownMenuItem(
                  child: Text('Alternative'),
                  value: PieceSet.alternativeSet,
                ),
              ],
            ),
            DropdownButton(
              value: _boardTheme,
              onChanged: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  _boardTheme = value;
                });
              },
              items: [
                DropdownMenuItem(
                  child: Text('Default'),
                  value: BoardTheme.defaultTheme,
                ),
                DropdownMenuItem(
                  child: Text('Dark'),
                  value: BoardTheme.darkTheme,
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user selects a game mode, piece set, and board theme from the dropdown menus.
// 2. The selected values are used to customize the Chessground widget.
// 3. The user interacts with the Chessground widget by moving pieces.
// 4. The onMove callback is triggered whenever a piece is moved.
// 5. The moved piece's from and to positions are printed to the console.

// This code demonstrates the usage of the Chessground package in a real-world scenario.
// It showcases the customization options and user interaction handling capabilities of the package.

// In a real-world application, you would likely want to handle the user interactions more robustly,
// such as by updating the game state, checking for valid moves, and displaying errors or warnings.
