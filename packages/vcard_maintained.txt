# Complete Example of Using vcard_maintained

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vcard_maintained/vcard_maintained.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'vCard Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('vCard Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create a new vCard instance
              VCard vCard = VCard();
              
              // Set the vCard properties
              vCard.firstName = "John";
              vCard.lastName = "Doe";
              vCard.email = "john.doe@example.com";
              vCard.phoneNumber = "123-456-7890";
              
              // Generate the vCard string
              String vCardString = vCard.getFormattedString();
              
              // Here you can save or share the vCardString
              print(vCardString); // For demonstration, we print it to the console
            },
            child: Text('Generate vCard'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'vCard Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, a new vCard instance is created.
// 6. The vCard properties (first name, last name, email, and phone number) are set.
// 7. The vCard string is generated using the getFormattedString method.
// 8. Finally, the vCard string is printed to the console, demonstrating how to use the package.
