# Tutorial: Setting Up Chewie Audio

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Chewie Audio package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

To get started, you need to add the Chewie and video_player packages to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  chewie: ^1.0.0
  video_player: ^2.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependencies.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you need to add the following permissions in your `Info.plist` file to allow audio playback:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio playback.</string>
<key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your music library for audio playback.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's create a simple audio player using Chewie. Below is a basic example of how to implement the audio player in your Flutter app.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chewie/chewie.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Chewie Audio Example',
      home: AudioPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class AudioPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AudioPlayerScreenState createState() => _AudioPlayerScreenState();
}

class _AudioPlayerScreenState extends State<AudioPlayerScreen> {
  late VideoPlayerController _videoPlayerController;
  late ChewieController _chewieController;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the VideoPlayerController with a local asset or network URL
    _videoPlayerController = VideoPlayerController.asset('assets/audio/sample.mp3');

    // Initialize ChewieController with the VideoPlayerController
    _chewieController = ChewieController(
      videoPlayerController: _videoPlayerController,
      autoPlay: true, // Automatically start playback
      looping: true, // Loop the audio
      // Additional options can be set here
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the controllers when the widget is removed from the widget tree
    _videoPlayerController.dispose();
    _chewieController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chewie Audio Player'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Use Chewie to display the audio player
        child: Chewie(
          controller: _chewieController,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with the title 'Chewie Audio Example'.
// 3. The home screen is set to AudioPlayerScreen.
// 4. In AudioPlayerScreen, we initialize the VideoPlayerController with an audio file.
// 5. We create a ChewieController to manage the audio playback.
// 6. The Chewie widget is used to display the audio player UI.
// 7. The audio starts playing automatically and loops indefinitely.
// 8. When the screen is disposed, we clean up the controllers to free resources.
```
