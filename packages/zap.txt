# Setting Up and Using the "zap" Package
==========================================

To use the "zap" package in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  zap: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:zap/zap.dart';
```
### Step 3: Use the Package

Use the pre-built widgets and utilities provided by the package to build your application. For example:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zap/zap.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ZapButton(
      onPressed: () {
        print('Button pressed!');
      },
      child: Text('Click me!'),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zap/zap.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'RealFlutter',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a ZapButton with a custom label and icon
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('RealFlutter'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ZapButton(
              onPressed: _incrementCounter,
              child: Row(
                children: <Widget>[
                  Icon(Icons.add),
                  Text('Increment counter'),
                ],
              ),
            ),
            Text(
              'Counter: $_counter',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user launches the application and is presented with a button labeled "Increment counter".
// 2. When the user presses the button, the _incrementCounter function is called, which increments the _counter variable.
// 3. The setState function is called to update the UI with the new counter value.
// 4. The Text widget displaying the counter value is updated with the new value.
// 5. The user can continue to press the button to increment the counter.
// 6. The application continues to run until the user closes it.

// Final summary: This code demonstrates the use of the "zap" package to create a simple counter application with a custom button and label.
