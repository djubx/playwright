# Complete Example of Awesome Dialog in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:awesome_dialog/awesome_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Awesome Dialog Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Awesome Dialog Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Triggering an information dialog when the button is pressed
              AwesomeDialog(
                context: context,
                dialogType: DialogType.INFO,
                animType: AnimType.BOTTOMSLIDE,
                title: 'Information',
                desc: 'This is an information dialog.',
                btnOkOnPress: () {},
              ).show();
            },
            child: Text('Show Info Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, an AwesomeDialog is created and displayed.
// 5. The dialog type is set to INFO, with a title and description provided.
// 6. The dialog has an OK button that closes the dialog when pressed.
```

// The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the Flutter app, displays a button, and shows an information dialog when the button is clicked. The dialog enhances user interaction by providing feedback in a visually appealing manner.
