# Editable Flutter Package

The **editable** Flutter package is a powerful tool that allows developers to create editable text fields with rich formatting options. This package is particularly useful for applications that require user input in a structured format, such as note-taking apps, content management systems, or any application where users need to input formatted text.

## Features
- **Rich Text Editing**: Supports various text styles, including bold, italic, underline, and more.
- **Customizable Toolbar**: Allows developers to create a custom toolbar for text formatting options.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Users can easily revert changes or redo actions, enhancing the editing experience.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

## When to Use
You should consider using the editable package when:
- You need to implement a text editor with rich formatting capabilities.
- Your application requires user-generated content that needs to be styled.
- You want to provide a user-friendly interface for text input with formatting options.

In summary, the editable package is an essential tool for Flutter developers looking to enhance user interaction with text input fields.

# Tutorial: Setting Up the Editable Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the editable package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  editable: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/editable).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, depending on your app's requirements. For example, if you are using features that require internet access, add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package
In your Dart file, import the editable package:

```dart
import 'package:editable/editable.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Editable Widget
You can now use the `Editable` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
Editable(
  controller: TextEditingController(),
  toolbarOptions: ToolbarOptions(
    copy: true,
    paste: true,
    cut: true,
    selectAll: true,
  ),
)
```

This will create a basic editable text field with a toolbar for text manipulation.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the editable package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of the Editable Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:editable/editable.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Editable Example',
      home: EditableExample(),
    );
  }
}

class EditableExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EditableExampleState createState() => _EditableExampleState();
}

class _EditableExampleState extends State<EditableExample> {
  // Controller to manage the text input
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Editable Text Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Editable widget for rich text editing
            Editable(
              controller: _controller,
              toolbarOptions: ToolbarOptions(
                copy: true,
                paste: true,
                cut: true,
                selectAll: true,
              ),
              onChanged: (text) {
                // Callback when text changes
                print("Text changed: $text");
              },
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Action to save the text
                print("Saved text: ${_controller.text}");
              },
              child: Text('Save Text'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the root widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets EditableExample as the home widget.
// 3. EditableExample is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the editable text.
// 4. Inside the build method, an Editable widget is created with a TextEditingController.
// 5. The Editable widget allows users to input and format text, with a toolbar for text manipulation.
// 6. When the text changes, the onChanged callback prints the updated text to the console.
// 7. A button is provided to save the text, which prints the current text to the console when pressed.
```

// The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the app, displays an editable text field, and allows users to input and format text. The text can be saved by pressing the button, which outputs the current text to the console. This demonstrates the core functionality of the editable package, showcasing its rich text editing capabilities in a user-friendly interface.
