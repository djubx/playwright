# VPN Check Flutter Package

The `vpn_check` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers determine whether a VPN is currently active on a user's device. This package is particularly useful for applications that require secure connections or need to enforce certain network policies based on the user's VPN status. 

## When to Use This Package
- **Security Applications**: If you're developing an app that handles sensitive information, knowing whether a VPN is active can help you enforce security protocols.
- **Network Monitoring**: For applications that need to monitor network conditions, detecting VPN usage can provide insights into user behavior and network performance.
- **Compliance**: In industries where compliance with data protection regulations is critical, ensuring that a VPN is used or not can be a requirement.

## Features
- **Simple API**: The package provides a straightforward API to check the VPN status.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Real-time Updates**: Allows for real-time monitoring of VPN status changes.

By integrating the `vpn_check` package into your Flutter application, you can enhance the security and functionality of your app while providing a better user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the VPN Check Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `vpn_check` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vpn_check: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/vpn_check).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request permission for network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to check the VPN status.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vpn_check/vpn_check.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  bool _isVPNActive = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _checkVPNStatus();
  }

  // Function to check VPN status
  void _checkVPNStatus() async {
    bool isVPN = await VpnCheck.isVPNActive();
    setState(() {
      _isVPNActive = isVPN;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('VPN Check Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          _isVPNActive ? 'VPN is Active' : 'VPN is Inactive',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the VPN check when the app starts and updates the UI based on the VPN status.

# Complete Example of VPN Check in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:vpn_check/vpn_check.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Variable to hold the VPN status
  bool _isVPNActive = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Check VPN status when the app starts
    _checkVPNStatus();
  }

  // Function to check if VPN is active
  void _checkVPNStatus() async {
    // Call the method from vpn_check package
    bool isVPN = await VpnCheck.isVPNActive();
    // Update the state with the VPN status
    setState(() {
      _isVPNActive = isVPN;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('VPN Check Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // Display VPN status
        child: Text(
          _isVPNActive ? 'VPN is Active' : 'VPN is Inactive',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. In the initState method, the _checkVPNStatus function is called.
// 3. The _checkVPNStatus function uses the VpnCheck package to determine if a VPN is active.
// 4. The result is stored in the _isVPNActive variable.
// 5. The UI is updated to display whether the VPN is active or inactive based on the value of _isVPNActive.
