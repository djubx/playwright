# Tutorial: Setting Up InspireUI

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the InspireUI package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the InspireUI package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  inspireui: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/inspireui).

## Step 2: Install Packages

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if your app requires internet access or other features.

### For iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following lines to allow network access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Step 4: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the InspireUI package:

```dart
import 'package:inspireui/inspireui.dart';
```

Now you are ready to use the InspireUI components in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example: Using InspireUI in a Flutter Application

Below is a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the InspireUI package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:inspireui/inspireui.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutterApp());
}

// Main application class
class RealFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'InspireUI Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

// Home page widget
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('InspireUI Home'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Welcome to InspireUI!',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Navigate to the product list page
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => ProductListPage()),
                );
              },
              child: Text('View Products'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Product list page widget
class ProductListPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Product List'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: 10, // Example product count
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text('Product ${index + 1}'),
            subtitle: Text('Description of Product ${index + 1}'),
            onTap: () {
              // Navigate to product detail page
              Navigator.push(
                context,
                MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => ProductDetailPage(index: index)),
              );
            },
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Product detail page widget
class ProductDetailPage extends StatelessWidget {
  final int index;

  ProductDetailPage({required this.index});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Product ${index + 1} Details'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Details of Product ${index + 1}',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutterApp`.
// The `RealFlutterApp` class sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// The home page is defined in the `HomePage` class, which contains a welcome message and a button.
// When the button is pressed, it navigates to the `ProductListPage`.
// The `ProductListPage` displays a list of products using a ListView.
// Each product is a ListTile that, when tapped, navigates to the `ProductDetailPage`.
// The `ProductDetailPage` shows the details of the selected product based on the index passed from the list.
