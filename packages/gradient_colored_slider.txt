# Complete Example of Gradient Colored Slider

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gradient_colored_slider/gradient_colored_slider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Gradient Colored Slider Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Gradient Colored Slider'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SliderDemo(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SliderDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SliderDemoState createState() => _SliderDemoState();
}

class _SliderDemoState extends State<SliderDemo> {
  double _sliderValue = 0.5; // Initial value of the slider

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        // Display the current value of the slider
        Text(
          'Slider Value: ${_sliderValue.toStringAsFixed(2)}',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between text and slider
        // Gradient Colored Slider
        GradientColoredSlider(
          value: _sliderValue, // Current value of the slider
          min: 0.0, // Minimum value
          max: 1.0, // Maximum value
          onChanged: (newValue) {
            setState(() {
              _sliderValue = newValue; // Update the slider value
            });
          },
          gradient: LinearGradient(
            colors: [Colors.red, Colors.blue], // Gradient colors
          ),
          thumbColor: Colors.white, // Color of the slider thumb
          trackHeight: 8.0, // Height of the slider track
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered SliderDemo widget.
// 3. SliderDemo is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the slider value.
// 4. The build method of SliderDemo creates a Column with a Text widget displaying the current slider value and a GradientColoredSlider.
// 5. When the slider is moved, the onChanged callback updates the _sliderValue state, which triggers a rebuild to reflect the new value.
```
