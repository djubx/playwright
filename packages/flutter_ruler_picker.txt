# flutter_ruler_picker: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_ruler_picker` package is a versatile Flutter widget that allows developers to create a ruler-like interface for selecting numerical values. This package is particularly useful in applications where precise measurements or selections are required, such as in design tools, measurement apps, or any scenario where users need to pick a value from a defined range.

## When to Use `flutter_ruler_picker`

- **Design Applications**: When users need to select dimensions or colors based on numerical values.
- **Measurement Tools**: For apps that require users to input measurements, such as height, width, or distance.
- **Custom Settings**: In applications where users can adjust settings using a numerical scale, like volume or brightness.

## Features

- **Customizable Ruler**: The ruler can be customized in terms of color, size, and scale.
- **Smooth Interaction**: Provides a smooth and intuitive user experience for selecting values.
- **Range Selection**: Allows users to select values within a specified range, making it flexible for various use cases.
- **Event Handling**: Supports callbacks for value changes, enabling real-time updates in the UI.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_ruler_picker

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_ruler_picker` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_ruler_picker` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_ruler_picker: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # or higher
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_ruler_picker/flutter_ruler_picker.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Ruler Picker

You can now use the `RulerPicker` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
RulerPicker(
  minValue: 0,
  maxValue: 100,
  onChanged: (value) {
    print("Selected value: $value");
  },
)
```

This widget will create a ruler that allows users to select a value between 0 and 100. The `onChanged` callback will print the selected value to the console.

## Step 5: Customizing the Ruler

You can customize the appearance of the ruler by modifying its properties:

```dart
RulerPicker(
  minValue: 0,
  maxValue: 100,
  divisions: 10,
  rulerColor: Colors.blue,
  onChanged: (value) {
    print("Selected value: $value");
  },
)
```

In this example, we added `divisions` to create 10 segments on the ruler and changed the `rulerColor` to blue.

With these steps, you should be able to integrate the `flutter_ruler_picker` into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of flutter_ruler_picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_ruler_picker/flutter_ruler_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Ruler Picker Example',
      home: RulerPickerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class RulerPickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RulerPickerDemoState createState() => _RulerPickerDemoState();
}

class _RulerPickerDemoState extends State<RulerPickerDemo> {
  double _selectedValue = 0; // Variable to hold the selected value

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Ruler Picker Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Display the selected value
            Text(
              'Selected Value: ${_selectedValue.toStringAsFixed(1)}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Ruler Picker widget
            RulerPicker(
              minValue: 0, // Minimum value of the ruler
              maxValue: 100, // Maximum value of the ruler
              divisions: 10, // Number of divisions on the ruler
              rulerColor: Colors.blue, // Color of the ruler
              onChanged: (value) {
                setState(() {
                  _selectedValue = value; // Update the selected value
                });
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. RulerPickerDemo is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the selected value.
// 4. In the build method, we create a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, we display the currently selected value and the RulerPicker.
// 6. The RulerPicker allows users to select a value between 0 and 100, with 10 divisions.
// 7. When the user changes the value, the onChanged callback updates the _selectedValue state.
// 8. The UI is rebuilt to reflect the new selected value.
