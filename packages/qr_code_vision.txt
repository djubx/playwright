# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the QR Code Vision Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `qr_code_vision` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `qr_code_vision` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  qr_code_vision: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/qr_code_vision).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add camera permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera"/>
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera to scan QR codes.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a complete example demonstrating how to implement QR code scanning.

# Complete Example: QR Code Scanning Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:qr_code_vision/qr_code_vision.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'QR Code Scanner',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: QRScannerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class QRScannerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _QRScannerScreenState createState() => _QRScannerScreenState();
}

class _QRScannerScreenState extends State<QRScannerScreen> {
  String? scannedData; // Variable to hold scanned QR code data

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('QR Code Scanner'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          // Display scanned data if available
          if (scannedData != null)
            Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
              child: Text(
                'Scanned Data: $scannedData',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ),
          // QR Code Scanner widget
          Expanded(
            child: QRCodeScanner(
              onScan: (data) {
                setState(() {
                  scannedData = data; // Update scanned data
                });
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to QRScannerScreen, which is a stateful widget.
// 4. In QRScannerScreen, we define a variable 'scannedData' to hold the data from the QR code.
// 5. The build method constructs the UI, displaying the scanned data if available.
// 6. The QRCodeScanner widget is used to scan QR codes, and when a code is scanned, the onScan callback is triggered.
// 7. The scanned data is updated in the state, causing the UI to refresh and display the new data.
```
