# Setting Up flutter_hooks_lint_plugin: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Installation

To get started with the `flutter_hooks_lint_plugin`, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency under `dev_dependencies`:

   ```yaml
   dev_dependencies:
     flutter_hooks_lint_plugin: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks_lint_plugin).

2. **Configure Analysis Options**: Create or update your `analysis_options.yaml` file in the root of your project to include the plugin:

   ```yaml
   include: package:flutter_hooks_lint_plugin/analysis_options.yaml
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**: 
   - **Android**: No specific configuration is required for Android.
   - **iOS**: Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

     ```ruby
     platform :ios, '10.0'
     ```

4. **Run Flutter Analyze**: After setting up, run the following command to check for any linting issues:

   ```bash
   flutter analyze
   ```

## Usage

Once the package is installed and configured, you can start using it in your Flutter project. The lint rules will automatically apply as you write your code, providing real-time feedback on your usage of hooks.

You can customize the linting rules in your `analysis_options.yaml` file by adding or modifying the rules under the `linter` section. For example:

```yaml
linter:
  rules:
    # Enable or disable specific lint rules
    prefer_final_locals: true
    unnecessary_this: true
```

This setup ensures that you are following best practices while using Flutter Hooks in your application.

# Complete Example of Using flutter_hooks_lint_plugin

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Using a hook to manage state
    final counter = useState(0);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Hooks Lint Plugin Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'You have pushed the button this many times:',
              ),
              // Displaying the current counter value
              Text(
                '${counter.value}',
                style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Incrementing the counter when the button is pressed
            counter.value++;
          },
          tooltip: 'Increment',
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

/*
Application Flow Explanation:
1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
2. RealFlutter is a HookWidget that allows the use of hooks for state management.
3. Inside the build method, we declare a state variable 'counter' using useState, initialized to 0.
4. The MaterialApp widget is created, containing a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
5. The body consists of a Center widget that holds a Column displaying the current count and a FloatingActionButton.
6. When the FloatingActionButton is pressed, the counter's value is incremented, and the UI updates automatically due to the reactive nature of hooks.
7. The application demonstrates the use of hooks for state management while adhering to linting rules provided by the flutter_hooks_lint_plugin.
