# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Simple Star Rating

## Installation
To use the `simple_star_rating` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  simple_star_rating: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if you are using any features that require user permissions. However, for the `simple_star_rating` package, no specific permissions are needed.

## Using the Package
To use the `simple_star_rating` package, you need to import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:simple_star_rating/simple_star_rating.dart';
```

You can then create a star rating widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
// Inside your widget build method
SimpleStarRating(
  allowHalfRating: true, // Allow half-star ratings
  starCount: 5, // Total number of stars
  rating: 3.5, // Initial rating value
  size: 40.0, // Size of the stars
  onRatingChanged: (rating) {
    // Handle the rating change
    print(rating); // Print the new rating value
  },
),
```

This code snippet creates a star rating widget with 5 stars, an initial rating of 3.5, and allows half-star ratings. The `onRatingChanged` callback is triggered whenever the user selects a new rating, allowing you to handle the new value accordingly.

# Complete Example of Simple Star Rating

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:simple_star_rating/simple_star_rating.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Star Rating Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Star Rating Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: RatingWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RatingWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RatingWidgetState createState() => _RatingWidgetState();
}

class _RatingWidgetState extends State<RatingWidget> {
  double _rating = 3.0; // Initial rating value

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: <Widget>[
        // Display the star rating widget
        SimpleStarRating(
          allowHalfRating: true, // Allow half-star ratings
          starCount: 5, // Total number of stars
          rating: _rating, // Current rating value
          size: 40.0, // Size of the stars
          onRatingChanged: (rating) {
            // Update the state with the new rating
            setState(() {
              _rating = rating; // Update the rating value
            });
            print("New Rating: $_rating"); // Print the new rating value
          },
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20), // Add some space
        Text(
          'Your Rating: $_rating', // Display the current rating
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// Explanation of the application flow:

// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that holds the RatingWidget.
// 4. The RatingWidget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the current rating state.
// 5. Inside the RatingWidget, the SimpleStarRating widget is created with properties:
//    - allowHalfRating: true allows users to select half-star ratings.
//    - starCount: 5 sets the total number of stars to 5.
//    - rating: _rating initializes the star rating with the current value.
//    - size: 40.0 sets the size of each star.
//    - onRatingChanged: a callback that updates the state with the new rating when the user interacts with the stars.
// 6. Below the star rating, a Text widget displays the current rating value.
// 7. When the user selects a new rating, the onRatingChanged callback is triggered, updating the _rating state and printing the new rating to the console.
