# Complete Example of Using Solar Icons

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:solar_icons/solar_icons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Solar Icons Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Solar Icons Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying a solar panel icon
              Icon(
                SolarIcons.solar_panel,
                size: 100.0,
                color: Colors.yellow,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a sun icon
              Icon(
                SolarIcons.sun,
                size: 100.0,
                color: Colors.orange,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              // Displaying a battery icon
              Icon(
                SolarIcons.battery,
                size: 100.0,
                color: Colors.green,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of the MaterialApp is set to a Scaffold, which provides a structure for the app.
// 4. An AppBar is created with the title 'Solar Icons Demo'.
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget that centers its child.
// 6. A Column widget is used to arrange the icons vertically.
// 7. Three solar-themed icons (solar panel, sun, and battery) are displayed with specified sizes and colors.
// 8. SizedBox widgets are used to add space between the icons for better visual separation.
