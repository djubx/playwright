# Breadcrumbs Flutter Package

The **breadcrumbs** Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to enhance navigation within Flutter applications. It provides a simple way to implement breadcrumb navigation, which is particularly useful in applications with deep navigation hierarchies. Breadcrumbs help users understand their current location within the app and allow them to navigate back to previous sections easily.

## When to Use

Breadcrumbs are especially beneficial in applications that have multiple layers of navigation, such as:

- E-commerce apps with categories and subcategories.
- Content management systems where users navigate through various content types.
- Any app that requires users to traverse through multiple screens or sections.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: You can easily customize the look and feel of the breadcrumbs to match your app's design.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Breadcrumbs can be updated dynamically as users navigate through different sections of the app.
- **Accessibility**: Improves user experience by providing a clear path of navigation, making it easier for users to backtrack.

In summary, the breadcrumbs package is an essential tool for enhancing user navigation in Flutter applications, making it easier for users to understand their location and navigate back to previous screens.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Breadcrumbs Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the breadcrumbs package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  breadcrumbs: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files where you want to use breadcrumbs, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:breadcrumbs/breadcrumbs.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Breadcrumbs Widget

You can now use the `Breadcrumbs` widget in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
Breadcrumbs(
  items: [
    BreadcrumbItem(label: 'Home', onTap: () => navigateToHome()),
    BreadcrumbItem(label: 'Category', onTap: () => navigateToCategory()),
    BreadcrumbItem(label: 'Product', onTap: () => navigateToProduct()),
  ],
)
```

This will create a breadcrumb trail that users can tap to navigate back to previous sections.

## Conclusion

You are now ready to implement the breadcrumbs package in your Flutter application. The next section will provide a complete example demonstrating its usage in a functional app.

# Complete Example of Using the Breadcrumbs Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:breadcrumbs/breadcrumbs.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Breadcrumbs Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Home Screen'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Navigate to Category Screen
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => CategoryScreen()),
                );
              },
              child: Text('Go to Category'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CategoryScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Category')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Breadcrumbs(
            items: [
              BreadcrumbItem(label: 'Home', onTap: () => Navigator.popUntil(context, ModalRoute.withName('/'))),
              BreadcrumbItem(label: 'Category', onTap: () => Navigator.pop(context)),
            ],
          ),
          Center(
            child: Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Text('Category Screen'),
                ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    // Navigate to Product Screen
                    Navigator.push(
                      context,
                      MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => ProductScreen()),
                    );
                  },
                  child: Text('Go to Product'),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ProductScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Product')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Breadcrumbs(
            items: [
              BreadcrumbItem(label: 'Home', onTap: () => Navigator.popUntil(context, ModalRoute.withName('/'))),
              BreadcrumbItem(label: 'Category', onTap: () => Navigator.pop(context)),
              BreadcrumbItem(label: 'Product', onTap: () => Navigator.pop(context)),
            ],
          ),
          Center(
            child: Text('Product Screen'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the HomeScreen, where the user can navigate to the CategoryScreen.
// 2. In the CategoryScreen, the Breadcrumbs widget displays the navigation path.
// 3. The user can tap on 'Home' in the breadcrumbs to return to the HomeScreen or 'Category' to go back to the previous screen.
// 4. From the CategoryScreen, the user can navigate to the ProductScreen.
// 5. The ProductScreen also has breadcrumbs showing the path back to Home and Category, allowing easy navigation back to previous sections.
