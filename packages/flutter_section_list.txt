# Setting Up the Package
-------------------------

To use the `flutter_section_list` package, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec File

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```

### Step 2: Import the Package

### Step 3: Create a Section List

Create a section list by using the `SectionList` widget:

  sections: [
    Section(
      header: Text('Section 1'),
      children: [
        ListTile(title: Text('Item 1')),
        ListTile(title: Text('Item 2')),
      ],
    ),
    Section(
      header: Text('Section 2'),
      children: [

      ],
    ),
  ],
)
```

### Platform-Specific Details

The package works on both Android and iOS platforms. However, you may need to adjust the section header style to match the platform's design guidelines.

### Configurations and Optimizations

You can customize the section list by using the following properties:

*   `sectionHeaderBuilder`: A builder function that returns a custom section header widget.
*   `sectionFooterBuilder`: A builder function that returns a custom section footer widget.
*   `itemBuilder`: A builder function that returns a custom item widget.
*   `separatorBuilder`: A builder function that returns a custom separator widget.

// The app starts by running the main function, which creates a new instance of the MyApp widget.
// The MyApp widget is a stateless widget that returns a MaterialApp widget with a title and a theme.
// The home property of the MaterialApp widget is set to the MyHomePage widget.
// The MyHomePage widget is a stateful widget that returns a Scaffold widget with an AppBar and a body.
// The body of the Scaffold widget is set to a SectionList widget, which is a custom widget that displays a list of sections.
// Each section in the list is represented by a Section widget, which has a header and a list of children.
// The children of each section are represented by ListTile widgets, which display a title and an optional subtitle.
// When the app is run, the SectionList widget is displayed on the screen, showing the list of sections and their children.
