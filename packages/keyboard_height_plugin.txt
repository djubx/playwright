# Understanding the `keyboard_height_plugin` Flutter Package

The `keyboard_height_plugin` is a Flutter package designed to help developers manage and respond to the on-screen keyboard's height changes. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where the UI needs to adjust dynamically when the keyboard appears or disappears, such as in chat applications or forms where input fields might be obscured by the keyboard.

## When to Use

- **Chat Applications**: Adjust the chat input field and message list when the keyboard appears.
- **Forms**: Ensure that input fields are not hidden by the keyboard, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Custom UI Adjustments**: Any application where the UI needs to adapt to the presence of the keyboard.

## Features

- **Real-time Keyboard Height Detection**: Provides the current height of the keyboard as it appears and disappears.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS, ensuring consistent behavior across devices.
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate with existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.

# Setting Up and Using the `keyboard_height_plugin`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `keyboard_height_plugin` in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.

## Setup Process

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `keyboard_height_plugin` to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     keyboard_height_plugin: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependency.

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **iOS**: Ensure that your `Info.plist` file is configured correctly. No additional setup is required for this plugin.
   - **Android**: No specific configuration is needed beyond the standard Flutter setup.

## Using the Plugin

1. **Import the Package**: Import the package in your Dart file.

   ```dart
   import 'package:keyboard_height_plugin/keyboard_height_plugin.dart';
   ```

2. **Implement the Listener**: Use the `KeyboardHeightPlugin` to listen for keyboard height changes.

   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
   }

   class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
     double _keyboardHeight = 0.0;

     @override
     void initState() {
       super.initState();
       KeyboardHeightPlugin().onKeyboardHeightChanged.listen((double height) {
         setState(() {
           _keyboardHeight = height;
         });
       });
     }

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Keyboard Height Example')),
         body: Center(
           child: Text('Keyboard Height: $_keyboardHeight'),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:keyboard_height_plugin/keyboard_height_plugin.dart';

// Main entry point of the application
void main() => runApp(RealFlutter());

// RealFlutter is the main widget of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Keyboard Height Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: KeyboardHeightExample(),
    );
  }
}

// Stateful widget to demonstrate keyboard height changes
class KeyboardHeightExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _KeyboardHeightExampleState createState() => _KeyboardHeightExampleState();
}

class _KeyboardHeightExampleState extends State<KeyboardHeightExample> {
  double _keyboardHeight = 0.0; // Variable to store the current keyboard height

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Listen for keyboard height changes
    KeyboardHeightPlugin().onKeyboardHeightChanged.listen((double height) {
      setState(() {
        _keyboardHeight = height; // Update the keyboard height
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Keyboard Height Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: <Widget>[
          TextField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              hintText: 'Tap to show keyboard',
            ),
          ),
          SizedBox(height: 20),
          Text(
            'Current Keyboard Height: $_keyboardHeight',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow:
// 1. The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. `RealFlutter` sets up a `MaterialApp` with a home screen of `KeyboardHeightExample`.
// 3. `KeyboardHeightExample` is a stateful widget that listens for keyboard height changes.
// 4. When the keyboard height changes, the listener updates the `_keyboardHeight` variable.
// 5. The UI displays a `TextField` and the current keyboard height, updating dynamically as the keyboard appears or disappears.
