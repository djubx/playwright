# Tutorial: Setting Up Dash Painter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the **dash_painter** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dash_painter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:dash_painter/dash_painter.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Dash Painter

You can now use the **dash_painter** package to create dashed lines. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use it in a Flutter widget:

```dart
DashPainter(
  dashArray: [5, 3], // Length of dashes and gaps
  strokeWidth: 2,    // Width of the dashed line
  color: Colors.blue, // Color of the dashed line
)
```

This will create a dashed line with dashes of length 5 and gaps of length 3, with a stroke width of 2 and a blue color.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the **dash_painter** package in your Flutter applications!

# Complete Example of Dash Painter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dash_painter/dash_painter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dash Painter Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dash Painter Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomPaint(
            size: Size(300, 300), // Set the size of the CustomPaint
            painter: DashPainter(
              dashArray: [10, 5], // Define the dash pattern
              strokeWidth: 4,     // Set the stroke width
              color: Colors.red,   // Set the color of the dashed line
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a CustomPaint widget is used to draw custom shapes.
// 5. The CustomPaint widget has a size of 300x300 pixels.
// 6. The DashPainter is used as the painter for the CustomPaint, with a dash pattern of 10 pixels for the dash and 5 pixels for the gap.
// 7. The stroke width is set to 4 pixels, and the color of the dashed line is red.
// 8. The result is a dashed line drawn in the center of the screen, demonstrating the capabilities of the dash_painter package.
