- **Building Custom Dialogs**: To create modal dialogs that are visually appealing and blend well with the app's theme.

## Features of `flutter_glass`

- **Customizable Glass Effect**: Adjust the opacity, blur, and color of the glass effect to fit your design needs.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different screen sizes and orientations.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `flutter_glass`

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_glass` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_glass` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_glass: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_glass).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable the `NSVisualEffectView` in your `Info.plist` file to support the glass effect. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the glass effect in your app.

# Complete Example: Implementing `flutter_glass`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_glass/flutter_glass.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Glass Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Glass Example'),
        ),
        body: Stack(
          children: [
            // Background image
            Image.network(
              'https://example.com/background.jpg',
              fit: BoxFit.cover,
              height: double.infinity,
              width: double.infinity,
            ),
            // Glass effect container
            Center(
              child: GlassContainer(
                width: 300,
                height: 200,
                blur: 10,
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
                child: Center(
                  child: Text(
                    'Hello, Glass!',
                    style: TextStyle(
                      fontSize: 24,
                      color: Colors.white,
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, an AppBar is created with the title 'Flutter Glass Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold contains a Stack widget that allows layering of widgets.
// 5. The first child of the Stack is an Image.network widget that sets a background image.
// 6. The second child is a GlassContainer, which creates the frosted glass effect.
// 7. The GlassContainer is centered on the screen and contains a Text widget displaying 'Hello, Glass!'.
// 8. The GlassContainer has a specified width, height, blur effect, and rounded corners.
```

// Final Summary:
// The application starts with the main function, which initializes the Flutter app. The RealFlutter widget sets up a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Stack. The Stack layers a background image and a GlassContainer, which showcases the frosted glass effect. The Text widget inside the GlassContainer displays a message, demonstrating how to use the `flutter_glass` package effectively.
