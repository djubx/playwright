# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using z_time_ago

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `z_time_ago` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  z_time_ago: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:z_time_ago/z_time_ago.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

### Basic Usage

You can use the `ZTimeAgo` class to convert timestamps into human-readable formats. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
DateTime now = DateTime.now();
String timeAgo = ZTimeAgo().format(now.subtract(Duration(minutes: 5))); // "5 minutes ago"
```

### Platform-Specific Details

#### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your project to support the latest Swift version. Open your `ios/Podfile` and ensure you have the following line:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing Formats

You can customize the output format by providing your own strings for singular and plural forms. For example:

```dart
String timeAgo = ZTimeAgo().format(now.subtract(Duration(hours: 1)), 
    singular: 'an hour ago', plural: 'hours ago'); // "an hour ago"
```

This allows you to tailor the output to fit your application's tone and style.

# Complete Example of z_time_ago in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:z_time_ago/z_time_ago.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'z_time_ago Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('z_time_ago Example'),
        ),
        body: TimeAgoExample(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class TimeAgoExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current time
    DateTime now = DateTime.now();

    // Create a list of timestamps to display
    List<DateTime> timestamps = [
      now.subtract(Duration(seconds: 30)), // 30 seconds ago
      now.subtract(Duration(minutes: 5)),  // 5 minutes ago
      now.subtract(Duration(hours: 2)),    // 2 hours ago
      now.subtract(Duration(days: 1)),     // 1 day ago
    ];

    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: timestamps.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        // Format each timestamp using z_time_ago
        String timeAgo = ZTimeAgo().format(timestamps[index]);
        return ListTile(
          title: Text(timeAgo), // Display the formatted time
        );
      },
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold containing an AppBar and the TimeAgoExample widget.
// 3. The TimeAgoExample widget builds a ListView that displays a list of timestamps formatted as "time ago" strings.
// 4. Each timestamp is generated by subtracting a specific duration from the current time.
// 5. The ZTimeAgo().format() method is called to convert each timestamp into a human-readable format, which is then displayed in a ListTile.
```
