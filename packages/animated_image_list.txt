# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `animated_image_list`

## Installation
To use the `animated_image_list` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  animated_image_list: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/animated_image_list).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `animated_image_list` package, you can create a simple widget that displays a list of images with animations. Below is a basic example of how to implement it in your Flutter application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_image_list/animated_image_list.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Image List Example')),
        body: AnimatedImageList(
          images: [
            'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
            'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
            'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
          ],
          duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300), // Animation duration
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app that displays a list of images with animations. The `AnimatedImageList` widget takes a list of image URLs and a duration for the animations.

With this setup, you can easily create animated image lists in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of `animated_image_list`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:animated_image_list/animated_image_list.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List of image URLs to display
  List<String> images = [
    'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image3.jpg',
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Animated Image List Example')),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            // AnimatedImageList widget to display images
            Expanded(
              child: AnimatedImageList(
                images: images,
                duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300), // Animation duration
              ),
            ),
            // Button to add a new image
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Adding a new image to the list
                setState(() {
                  images.add('https://example.com/image4.jpg');
                });
              },
              child: Text('Add Image'),
            ),
            // Button to remove the last image
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Removing the last image from the list
                setState(() {
                  if (images.isNotEmpty) {
                    images.removeLast();
                  }
                });
              },
              child: Text('Remove Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains a list of image URLs.
// 3. In the build method, we create a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Column.
// 4. The Column has an Expanded widget that contains the AnimatedImageList, which displays the images with animations.
// 5. Below the image list, there are two ElevatedButtons: one to add a new image and another to remove the last image.
// 6. When the "Add Image" button is pressed, a new image URL is added to the list, triggering a rebuild and showing the animation.
// 7. When the "Remove Image" button is pressed, the last image is removed from the list, also triggering a rebuild and showing the animation.
