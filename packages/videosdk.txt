# Setting Up the videosdk Package

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `videosdk` package and explain how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the `videosdk` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  videosdk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/videosdk).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure you have the following configurations:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21 // Minimum SDK version required
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file and add the following keys for camera and microphone usage:
   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your microphone for audio calls.</string>
   ```

## Basic Usage

To use the `videosdk` package, you need to initialize the SDK and create a video call. Here’s a simple example of how to do this:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:videosdk/videosdk.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late VideoSDK videoSDK;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    videoSDK = VideoSDK();
    // Initialize the SDK here
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Video Call')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Start a video call
          },
          child: Text('Start Call'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code initializes the `VideoSDK` and provides a button to start a video call. You can expand this further by adding more functionalities as needed.

# Complete Example of Using the videosdk Package

Here’s a fully functional Flutter main file that demonstrates the key features of the `videosdk` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:videosdk/videosdk.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late VideoSDK videoSDK; // Declare the VideoSDK instance
  late String roomId; // Room ID for the video call
  late String token; // Token for authentication

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    videoSDK = VideoSDK(); // Initialize the VideoSDK
    roomId = "your_room_id"; // Set your room ID
    token = "your_token"; // Set your authentication token
  }

  // Function to start the video call
  void startCall() async {
    // Join the room using the room ID and token
    await videoSDK.joinRoom(roomId, token);
    // Navigate to the video call screen
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => VideoCallScreen()),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Video Call')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: startCall, // Call the startCall function
          child: Text('Start Call'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Video call screen widget
class VideoCallScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('In Call')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Video Call in Progress...'), // Placeholder for video call
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. Upon pressing the "Start Call" button, the startCall function is triggered.
// 3. The startCall function joins the specified room using the VideoSDK.
// 4. After joining, it navigates to the VideoCallScreen where the video call takes place.
// 5. The VideoCallScreen currently displays a placeholder text, but this is where the video call UI would be implemented.
```

### Summary
In this blog post, we explored the `videosdk` Flutter package, detailing its features, setup process, and providing a complete example of how to implement video calling functionality in a Flutter application. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the SDK, allows users to join a video call, and navigates to a dedicated screen for the call. This package is a great choice for developers looking to add real-time video communication to their apps.
