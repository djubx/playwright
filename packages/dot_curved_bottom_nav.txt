# Tutorial: Setting Up dot_curved_bottom_nav

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `dot_curved_bottom_nav` package and explain how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `dot_curved_bottom_nav` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dot_curved_bottom_nav: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

## Step 3: Import the Package

# Complete Example of dot_curved_bottom_nav

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dot_curved_bottom_nav/dot_curved_bottom_nav.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dot Curved Bottom Nav Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Variable to keep track of the selected index
  int _selectedIndex = 0;

  // List of screens to navigate to
  final List<Widget> _screens = [
    Center(child: Text('Home Screen')),
    Center(child: Text('Search Screen')),
    Center(child: Text('Profile Screen')),
  ];

  // Function to handle navigation
  void _onItemTapped(int index) {
    setState(() {
      _selectedIndex = index; // Update the selected index
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dot Curved Bottom Nav Example'),
      ),
      body: _screens[_selectedIndex], // Display the selected screen
      bottomNavigationBar: DotCurvedBottomNav(
        // Define the items in the bottom navigation bar
        items: [
          DotCurvedBottomNavItem(
            icon: Icons.home,
            title: 'Home',
            activeColor: Colors.blue,
            inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
          ),
          DotCurvedBottomNavItem(
            icon: Icons.search,
            title: 'Search',
            activeColor: Colors.blue,
            inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
          ),
          DotCurvedBottomNavItem(
            icon: Icons.person,
            title: 'Profile',
            activeColor: Colors.blue,
            inactiveColor: Colors.grey,
          ),
        ],
        // Set the current index
        currentIndex: _selectedIndex,
        // Handle item taps
        onTap: _onItemTapped,
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget maintains the state of the selected index and the screens to display.
// 4. The bottom navigation bar is created using the DotCurvedBottomNav widget, which takes a list of items.
// 5. When an item is tapped, the _onItemTapped function updates the selected index, causing the UI to rebuild and display the corresponding screen.
```

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The app starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget sets up the `MaterialApp` and defines the home screen.
// 3. The `HomeScreen` widget maintains the state of the selected index and the screens to display.
