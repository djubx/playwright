# img_picker Flutter Package

The `img_picker` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of selecting images and videos from the device's gallery or capturing them using the camera. This package is particularly useful in applications that require media input, such as social media apps, photo editing tools, or any app that needs user-generated content.

## When to Use `img_picker`

You should consider using the `img_picker` package when:
- You need to allow users to upload images or videos from their device.
- You want to enable users to capture images or videos directly from the camera.
- You are developing applications that require media input for features like profile pictures, posts, or any visual content.

## Features
- **Image and Video Selection**: Users can choose images or videos from their gallery.
- **Camera Capture**: Users can take photos or record videos directly from the app.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Customizable Options**: You can specify the source (camera or gallery) and the maximum image size.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `img_picker`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `img_picker` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_picker: ^0.8.4+4  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following permissions:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the required permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request permission for camera and photo library access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select photos.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement image picking functionality.

# Complete Example of Using `img_picker`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_picker/image_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Picker Example',
      home: ImagePickerDemo(),
    );
  }
}

class ImagePickerDemo extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImagePickerDemoState createState() => _ImagePickerDemoState();
}

class _ImagePickerDemoState extends State<ImagePickerDemo> {
  // Variable to hold the selected image
  XFile? _image;

  // Instance of ImagePicker
  final ImagePicker _picker = ImagePicker();

  // Function to pick an image from the gallery
  Future<void> _pickImage() async {
    try {
      // Show the image picker dialog
      final XFile? pickedFile = await _picker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
      // Update the state with the selected image
      setState(() {
        _image = pickedFile;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors
      print('Error picking image: $e');
    }
  }

  // Function to capture an image using the camera
  Future<void> _captureImage() async {
    try {
      // Show the camera dialog
      final XFile? capturedFile = await _picker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.camera);
      // Update the state with the captured image
      setState(() {
        _image = capturedFile;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors
      print('Error capturing image: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Picker Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the selected image if available
            _image != null
                ? Image.file(File(_image!.path))
                : Text('No image selected.'),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to pick an image from the gallery
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickImage,
              child: Text('Pick Image from Gallery'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 10),
            // Button to capture an image using the camera
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _captureImage,
              child: Text('Capture Image with Camera'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to ImagePickerDemo.
// 3. ImagePickerDemo is a stateful widget that manages the state of the selected image.
// 4. The _pickImage function allows users to select an image from the gallery.
// 5. The _captureImage function allows users to take a photo using the camera.
// 6. The selected or captured image is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 7. Two buttons allow users to either pick an image from the gallery or capture one using the camera.
// 8. The app handles errors gracefully by printing them to the console.
