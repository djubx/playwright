## Getting Started with `flutter_chart`

### Installation

To add the `flutter_chart` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_chart: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

#### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` if your charts require access to device features. However, for basic charting, no additional configuration is typically required.

### Basic Usage

To use the `flutter_chart` package, you can start by importing it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_chart/flutter_chart.dart';
```

You can then create a simple chart by using the `RealFlutter` class, which will be defined in the complete example below.

## Complete Example of `flutter_chart`

Here is a fully functional Flutter application that demonstrates the key features of the `flutter_chart` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_chart/flutter_chart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Chart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Chart Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ChartWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ChartWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for the chart
    final data = [
      ChartData(x: 'Jan', y: 30),
      ChartData(x: 'Feb', y: 50),
      ChartData(x: 'Mar', y: 20),
      ChartData(x: 'Apr', y: 60),
    ];

    return LineChart(
      data: data,
      // Customizing the chart appearance
      lineColor: Colors.blue,
      pointColor: Colors.red,
      // Adding a title to the chart
      title: 'Monthly Sales Data',
      // Enabling animations
      animate: true,
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains the ChartWidget, which is responsible for displaying the chart.
// 4. Inside ChartWidget, we define sample data for the chart using ChartData objects.
// 5. We create a LineChart widget, passing the data and customizing its appearance with colors and a title.
// 6. The chart is animated, providing a smooth transition when it is displayed.
```

```

### Summary of Application Flow
The application starts with the `main` function, which initializes the `RealFlutter` widget. This widget sets up a basic Material app structure with an AppBar and a centered chart. The `ChartWidget` class is responsible for creating and displaying a line chart using sample data. The chart is customizable, allowing for different colors and animations, making it visually appealing and interactive for users.
