# Setting Up the Subtitle Package in Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the subtitle package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the subtitle package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  subtitle: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, especially if you are using features that require user permissions. Add the following lines if necessary:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for subtitle display.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the microphone for audio input.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Subtitle Package

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the subtitle widget.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:subtitle/subtitle.dart'; // Import the subtitle package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Subtitle Example',
      home: SubtitleDemo(), // Navigate to the SubtitleDemo widget
    );
  }
}

class SubtitleDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Subtitle Demo'), // App bar title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Displaying a subtitle with custom styles
            Subtitle(
              text: 'This is a subtitle example.',
              style: TextStyle(
                fontSize: 24, // Set font size
                color: Colors.blue, // Set text color
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, // Set font weight
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20), // Add space between widgets
            // Another subtitle with different styles
            Subtitle(
              text: 'Enjoy customizing your subtitles!',
              style: TextStyle(
                fontSize: 18, // Set font size
                color: Colors.green, // Set text color
                fontStyle: FontStyle.italic, // Set font style
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget.
// 3. The home widget is SubtitleDemo, which contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange two Subtitle widgets vertically.
// 5. Each Subtitle widget displays text with custom styles, demonstrating the flexibility of the subtitle package.
// 6. The app showcases how to use the subtitle package effectively, allowing for easy customization of text presentation.
```
