# katana_localization Flutter Package

The `katana_localization` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement localization in their applications. Localization is essential for reaching a broader audience by providing users with content in their native language. This package simplifies the process of managing translations and supports multiple languages seamlessly.

## When to Use This Package
You should consider using `katana_localization` when:
- You are developing a Flutter application that targets a global audience.
- You need to support multiple languages and want to manage translations efficiently.
- You want to avoid the complexity of manually handling localization files.

## Key Features
- **Easy Setup**: Quick integration into your Flutter project with minimal configuration.
- **Dynamic Language Switching**: Allows users to change the app's language at runtime without restarting the app.
- **Support for JSON Files**: Utilizes JSON files for managing translations, making it easy to edit and maintain.

# Tutorial: Setting Up katana_localization

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `katana_localization` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the `katana_localization` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  katana_localization: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/katana_localization).

## Step 2: Create Localization Files
Create a folder named `assets/localization` in your project directory. Inside this folder, create JSON files for each language you want to support. For example:

- `en.json` (for English)
- `es.json` (for Spanish)

### Example of `en.json`
```json
{
  "title": "Hello World",
  "message": "Welcome to the localization tutorial!"
}
```

### Example of `es.json`
```json
{
  "title": "Hola Mundo",
  "message": "¡Bienvenido al tutorial de localización!"
}
```

## Step 3: Configure the Package
In your `main.dart` file, initialize the `katana_localization` package. You will need to specify the supported locales and the path to your localization files.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:katana_localization/katana_localization.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return KatanaLocalization(
      supportedLocales: [
        Locale('en', ''),
        Locale('es', ''),
      ],
      fallbackLocale: Locale('en', ''),
      assetPath: 'assets/localization',
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Localization Demo',
        home: RealFlutter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Localization in Your Widgets
Now, you can use the localization in your widgets. For example, in your `RealFlutter` widget, you can access the localized strings as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:katana_localization/katana_localization.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(KatanaLocalization.of(context).translate('title')),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(KatanaLocalization.of(context).translate('message')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the correct configurations for localization. Typically, no additional configurations are needed beyond the standard Flutter setup.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your `Info.plist` file includes the supported languages under the `CFBundleLocalizations` key.

## Conclusion
You have now set up the `katana_localization` package in your Flutter application. You can easily manage translations and provide a localized experience for your users.

# Complete Example of katana_localization

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:katana_localization/katana_localization.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return KatanaLocalization(
      supportedLocales: [
        Locale('en', ''),
        Locale('es', ''),
      ],
      fallbackLocale: Locale('en', ''),
      assetPath: 'assets/localization',
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Localization Demo',
        home: RealFlutter(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(KatanaLocalization.of(context).translate('title')), // Accessing localized title
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(KatanaLocalization.of(context).translate('message')), // Accessing localized message
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Change language to Spanish
                KatanaLocalization.of(context).changeLocale(Locale('es', ''));
              },
              child: Text('Switch to Spanish'), // Button to switch language
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Change language to English
                KatanaLocalization.of(context).changeLocale(Locale('en', ''));
              },
              child: Text('Switch to English'), // Button to switch language
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets up the localization.
// 2. The MyApp widget configures the supported locales and the asset path for localization files.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds the UI, displaying localized text for the title and message.
// 4. Two buttons allow users to switch between English and Spanish dynamically.
// 5. When a button is pressed, the app updates the locale, and the UI reflects the change without needing a restart.
