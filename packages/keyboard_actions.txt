<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Keyboard Actions Flutter Package

The `keyboard_actions` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to enhance the user experience when dealing with keyboard inputs in mobile applications. It provides a way to manage keyboard actions, such as showing and hiding the keyboard, and allows for the customization of input fields with various keyboard types and actions.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `keyboard_actions` package in scenarios where:
- You have multiple text input fields and want to manage the keyboard's behavior effectively.
- You need to provide users with quick access to actions (like submitting a form) directly from the keyboard.
- You want to improve the overall usability of your app by managing keyboard visibility and actions seamlessly.

## Features

- **Customizable Keyboard Actions**: Define specific actions for the keyboard, such as "Done," "Next," or custom actions.
- **Focus Management**: Automatically manage focus between multiple text fields.
- **Keyboard Visibility Control**: Show or hide the keyboard programmatically based on user interactions.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS with minimal configuration.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Keyboard Actions Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `keyboard_actions` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  keyboard_actions: ^3.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:keyboard_actions/keyboard_actions.dart';
```

## Step 3: Configure for Android and iOS

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the following configuration to support soft input mode:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
</activity>
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to adjust the `Info.plist` file to ensure proper keyboard handling. Add the following key:

```xml
<key>UIKeyboardAnimationDurationUserInfoKey</key>
<real>0.25</real>
```

## Step 4: Implementing Keyboard Actions

You can now implement keyboard actions in your Flutter app. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a form with keyboard actions.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:keyboard_actions/keyboard_actions.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Keyboard Actions Example')),
        body: KeyboardActions(
          config: _buildKeyboardActionsConfig(),
          child: _buildForm(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Build the keyboard actions configuration
  KeyboardActionsConfig _buildKeyboardActionsConfig() {
    return KeyboardActionsConfig(
      keyboardActions: [
        KeyboardAction(
          focusNode: FocusNode(),
          onTap: () {
            // Handle the action when the button is tapped
            print('Action button tapped!');
          },
          displayAction: Text('Submit'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }

  // Build the form with text fields
  Widget _buildForm() {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          TextField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'First Name'),
          ),
          TextField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Last Name'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

# Complete Example of Keyboard Actions in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:keyboard_actions/keyboard_actions.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Keyboard Actions Example')),
        body: KeyboardActions(
          config: _buildKeyboardActionsConfig(), // Configure keyboard actions
          child: _buildForm(), // Build the form with text fields
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Build the keyboard actions configuration
  KeyboardActionsConfig _buildKeyboardActionsConfig() {
    return KeyboardActionsConfig(
      keyboardActions: [
        KeyboardAction(
          focusNode: FocusNode(), // Create a focus node for the action
          onTap: () {
            // Handle the action when the button is tapped
            print('Action button tapped!'); // Log action
          },
          displayAction: Text('Submit'), // Display text for the action
        ),
      ],
    );
  }

  // Build the form with text fields
  Widget _buildForm() {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0), // Add padding around the form
      child: Column(
        children: [
          TextField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'First Name'), // First name field
          ),
          TextField(
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Last Name'), // Last name field
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.
// 3. The body uses the KeyboardActions widget to manage keyboard actions.
// 4. The _buildKeyboardActionsConfig method sets up the keyboard actions, including a submit action.
// 5. The _buildForm method creates a simple form with two text fields for user input.
// 6. When the user taps the "Submit" action, it triggers the onTap callback, logging a message to the console.
