# Setting Up and Using the Flutter iLib Package
=============================================

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project

To use the `flutter_ilib` package, you'll need to add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file. You can do this by adding the following line:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter_ilib: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Step 2: Import the Package

Once the package is installed, you can import it into your Dart files using the following line:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_ilib/flutter_ilib.dart';
```
### Step 3: Configure the Package

The `flutter_ilib` package requires some configuration to work properly. You'll need to create a new instance of the `RealFlutter` class and pass it to the ` runApp` function.
```dart
void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter(
    // Your app's configuration goes here
  ));
}
```
### Platform-Specific Details

The `flutter_ilib` package has some platform-specific requirements.

#### Android

On Android, you'll need to add the following lines to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```
#### iOS

On iOS, you'll need to add the following lines to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_ilib/flutter_ilib.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter(
    // Create a new instance of the RealFlutter class
    child: MyApp(),
  ));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a new instance of the MaterialApp class
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter iLib Demo',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  // Create a new instance of the RealFlutter class
  final RealFlutter _realFlutter = RealFlutter();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a new instance of the Scaffold class
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter iLib Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            Text(
              _realFlutter.counter.toString(),
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.display1,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _realFlutter.incrementCounter,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user launches the app and the RealFlutter instance is created.
// 2. The RealFlutter instance creates a new instance of the MaterialApp class.
// 3. The MaterialApp instance creates a new instance of the MyHomePage class.
// 4. The MyHomePage instance creates a new instance of the RealFlutter class.
// 5. The RealFlutter instance initializes the counter to 0.
// 6. The user presses the floating action button and the RealFlutter instance increments the counter.
// 7. The RealFlutter instance updates the display with the new counter value.

// Summary:
// The code flows as follows: RealFlutter -> MaterialApp -> MyHomePage -> RealFlutter.
// The RealFlutter instance is responsible for managing the state of the app.
// The MaterialApp instance is responsible for creating the app's UI.
// The MyHomePage instance is responsible for displaying the app's UI.
