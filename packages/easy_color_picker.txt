```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  easy_color_picker: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to enable the use of Swift in your project. Open your `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure that the project settings are configured to support Swift.

## Usage
To use the easy_color_picker in your Flutter application, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:easy_color_picker/easy_color_picker.dart';
   ```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the color selection:
   ```dart
   class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
   }

   class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
     Color selectedColor = Colors.blue; // Default color

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Color Picker Example')),
         body: Center(
           child: Column(
             mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
             children: [
               // Display the selected color
               Container(
                 width: 100,
                 height: 100,
                 color: selectedColor,
               ),
               SizedBox(height: 20),
               // Button to open the color picker
               ElevatedButton(
                 onPressed: () {
                   // Open the color picker dialog
                   showDialog(
                     context: context,
                     builder: (context) {
                       return AlertDialog(
                         title: Text('Pick a Color'),
                         content: SingleChildScrollView(
                           child: ColorPicker(
                             onColorChanged: (color) {
                               setState(() {
                                 selectedColor = color; // Update the selected color
                               });
                               Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                             },
                             pickerColor: selectedColor, // Initial color
                           ),
                         ),
                       );
                     },
                   );
                 },
                 child: Text('Select Color'),
               ),
             ],
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

In this example, we create a simple app that allows users to select a color using the easy_color_picker package. The selected color is displayed in a container, and users can open a dialog to pick a new color.

# Complete Example of Easy Color Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:easy_color_picker/easy_color_picker.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Easy Color Picker Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  Color selectedColor = Colors.blue; // Default color

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Easy Color Picker Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(

            // Display the selected color in a square container

            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Button to open the color picker dialog
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Open the color picker dialog when the button is pressed
                showDialog(
                  context: context,
                  builder: (context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                      title: Text('Pick a Color'), // Title of the dialog
                      content: SingleChildScrollView(
                        child: ColorPicker(
                          onColorChanged: (color) {
                            setState(() {
                              selectedColor = color; // Update the selected color
                            });
                            Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                          },
                          pickerColor: selectedColor, // Set the initial color
                        ),
                      ),
                    );
                  },
                );
              },
              child: Text('Select Color'), // Button text
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as RealFlutter.
// 3. In RealFlutter, a stateful widget is created to manage the selected color.
// 4. The selected color is displayed in a container, and a button is provided to open the color picker dialog.
// 5. When the button is pressed, a dialog appears with the color picker.
// 6. The user can select a color, which updates the selectedColor state and closes the dialog.
// 7. The container's color updates to reflect the newly selected color.
