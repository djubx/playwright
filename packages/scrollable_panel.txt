# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Scrollable Panel Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `scrollable_panel` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scrollable_panel: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Scrollable Panel

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a scrollable panel.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scrollable_panel/scrollable_panel.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Scrollable Panel Example')),
        body: ScrollablePanel(
          child: Column(
            children: List.generate(50, (index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'),
              );
            }),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple app with a scrollable panel containing a list of items. The `ScrollablePanel` widget wraps a `Column` that generates 50 list items.

# Complete Example of Scrollable Panel

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scrollable_panel/scrollable_panel.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Scrollable Panel Example')),
        body: ScrollablePanel(
          // The ScrollablePanel widget allows for smooth scrolling of its child
          child: Column(
            // Using a Column to hold multiple ListTile widgets
            children: List.generate(50, (index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'), // Displaying item index
              );
            }),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Entry point of the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter application.
// 2. The RealFlutter class is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI.
// 3. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a Scaffold.
// 4. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body consists of a ScrollablePanel that wraps a Column.
// 6. The Column generates a list of 50 ListTile widgets, each displaying its index.
// 7. The ScrollablePanel allows users to scroll through the list of items smoothly.
