# tflite_maven Flutter Package

The `tflite_maven` package is a powerful tool for integrating TensorFlow Lite models into Flutter applications. It allows developers to leverage machine learning capabilities directly within their apps, enabling features such as image classification, object detection, and more. This package is particularly useful for applications that require on-device inference, providing a seamless experience without the need for constant internet connectivity.

## When to Use `tflite_maven`
- **Image Classification**: When you need to classify images in real-time, such as identifying objects in a photo.
- **Object Detection**: For applications that require detecting and localizing objects within images or video streams.
- **On-Device Inference**: When you want to run machine learning models locally on the device for performance and privacy reasons.

## Key Features
- **Support for TensorFlow Lite Models**: Easily load and run pre-trained TensorFlow Lite models.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Capable of processing inputs in real-time, making it suitable for interactive applications.
- **Customizable Input/Output**: Allows developers to define how data is fed into the model and how results are processed.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `tflite_maven`

In this section, we will walk through the setup process for the `tflite_maven` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Installation

To add the `tflite_maven` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  tflite_maven: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/tflite_maven).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Add Permissions**: Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following permissions to allow camera access if you plan to use the camera for input:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   ```

2. **Enable Java 8**: Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file includes the following configuration to support Java 8:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       compileOptions {
           sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
           targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
1. **Add Permissions**: Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following key to request camera access:

   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to the camera for image classification.</string>
   ```

2. **Enable Swift Support**: If your project does not already support Swift, you may need to create a bridging header.

## Using the Package

To use the `tflite_maven` package, follow these steps:

1. **Load the Model**: Load your TensorFlow Lite model using the `loadModel` method.
2. **Run Inference**: Use the `runModelOnImage` method to perform inference on an image.
3. **Process Results**: Handle the output from the model to display results in your app.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement these steps in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Using `tflite_maven`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tflite_maven/tflite_maven.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _result = "No result yet"; // Variable to hold the result of the inference

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _loadModel(); // Load the model when the app starts
  }

  // Function to load the TensorFlow Lite model
  _loadModel() async {
    String res = await Tflite.loadModel(
      model: "assets/model.tflite", // Path to your model file
      labels: "assets/labels.txt", // Path to your labels file
    );
    print(res); // Print the result of the model loading
  }

  // Function to run inference on an image
  _runModel(String imagePath) async {
    var result = await Tflite.runModelOnImage(
      path: imagePath, // Path to the image file
      numResults: 1, // Number of results to return
      threshold: 0.5, // Confidence threshold
    );
    setState(() {
      _result = result != null ? result[0]['label'] : "Error"; // Update the result
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("TensorFlow Lite Example")),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text("Result: $_result"), // Display the result
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Call the function to run the model on a sample image
                  _runModel("assets/sample_image.jpg");
                },
                child: Text("Run Model"),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. In the initState method, the _loadModel function is called to load the TensorFlow Lite model.
// 3. When the "Run Model" button is pressed, the _runModel function is called with the path to a sample image.
// 4. The model processes the image and returns the result, which is then displayed on the screen.
