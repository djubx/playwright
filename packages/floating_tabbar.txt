# Tutorial: Setting Up Floating TabBar

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **floating_tabbar** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **floating_tabbar** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  floating_tabbar: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 31 // or the latest version
    ...
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # or the latest version
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the floating tab bar.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:floating_tabbar/floating_tabbar.dart';
```

2. Create a basic Flutter application structure and implement the floating tab bar.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:floating_tabbar/floating_tabbar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Floating TabBar Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Floating TabBar Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: PageView(
              children: [
                Center(child: Text('Home Page')),
                Center(child: Text('Search Page')),
                Center(child: Text('Profile Page')),
              ],
            ),
          ),
          // Floating TabBar implementation
          FloatingTabBar(
            tabs: [
              Tab(icon: Icon(Icons.home), text: 'Home'),
              Tab(icon: Icon(Icons.search), text: 'Search'),
              Tab(icon: Icon(Icons.person), text: 'Profile'),
            ],
            onTap: (index) {
              // Handle tab change
              // You can use a PageController to navigate between pages
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function runs the RealFlutter app.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is set as the home of the MaterialApp.
// 4. Inside HomeScreen, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a body.
// 5. The body contains a Column with an Expanded widget for the PageView.
// 6. The PageView holds three pages: Home, Search, and Profile.
// 7. Below the PageView, the FloatingTabBar is implemented with three tabs.
// 8. Each tab has an icon and text, and the onTap callback can be used to handle tab changes.
```
