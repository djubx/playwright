# Overview of the get_storage_pro Flutter Package

The `get_storage_pro` package is a lightweight and efficient key-value storage solution for Flutter applications. It is built on top of the `GetX` package, which is widely used for state management and dependency injection in Flutter. This package is particularly useful for developers looking for a simple way to store and retrieve data locally without the overhead of a full database.

## When to Use `get_storage_pro`

- **Persistent Data Storage**: When you need to store user preferences, settings, or any small amount of data that should persist across app launches.
- **Lightweight Applications**: Ideal for applications that do not require complex data structures or relationships.
- **Quick Setup**: When you want a straightforward solution that requires minimal setup and configuration.

## Key Features

- **Simple API**: Easy to use with a straightforward API for storing and retrieving data.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Supports asynchronous read and write operations, ensuring smooth performance.
- **Data Types**: Can store various data types, including strings, integers, booleans, and lists.
- **Automatic Data Persistence**: Automatically saves data to disk, so you don’t have to worry about manual saving.
- **Integration with GetX**: Seamlessly integrates with the GetX ecosystem, making it a great choice for apps already using GetX for state management.

# Setting Up and Using get_storage_pro

## Installation

To use the `get_storage_pro` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  get_storage_pro: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/get_storage_pro).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following line inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<application>
    ...
    <meta-data
        android:name="flutterEmbedding"
        android:value="2" />
</application>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you typically do not need to make any special configurations for `get_storage_pro`. However, ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Basic Usage

To use `get_storage_pro`, you need to initialize it in your main application file. Here’s how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:get_storage_pro/get_storage_pro.dart';

void main() async {
  // Initialize GetStorage
  await GetStoragePro.init();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code, we initialize `GetStoragePro` before running the app to ensure that the storage is ready to use.

# Complete Example of Using get_storage_pro

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:get_storage_pro/get_storage_pro.dart';

void main() async {
  // Initialize GetStorage
  await GetStoragePro.init(); // Step 1: Initialize the storage
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Step 2: Run the main application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Get Storage Pro Example',
      home: HomeScreen(), // Step 3: Set the home screen
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  final GetStoragePro storage = GetStoragePro(); // Step 4: Create an instance of GetStorage
  String _storedValue = ''; // Step 5: Variable to hold the stored value

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _loadStoredValue(); // Step 6: Load the stored value when the screen initializes
  }

  // Step 7: Function to load the stored value
  void _loadStoredValue() {
    setState(() {
      _storedValue = storage.read('myKey') ?? ''; // Read value from storage
    });
  }

  // Step 8: Function to save a new value
  void _saveValue(String value) {
    storage.write('myKey', value); // Write value to storage
    _loadStoredValue(); // Reload the stored value
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Get Storage Pro Example'), // Step 9: AppBar title
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              onSubmitted: _saveValue, // Step 10: Save value on submission
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Enter a value',
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text('Stored Value: $_storedValue'), // Step 11: Display the stored value
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```
// Step 1: The app starts by initializing GetStorage, ensuring that the storage is ready for use.
// Step 2: The main application is run, which is an instance of RealFlutter.
// Step 3: The home screen of the application is set to HomeScreen.
// Step 4: An instance of GetStorage is created to handle storage operations.
// Step 5: A variable is declared to hold the value retrieved from storage.
// Step 6: The stored value is loaded when the screen initializes, ensuring the UI reflects any previously saved data.
// Step 7: The _loadStoredValue function reads the value associated with 'myKey' from storage and updates the state.
// Step 8: The _saveValue function writes a new value to storage and reloads the displayed value.
// Step 9: The AppBar displays the title of the application.
// Step 10: A TextField is provided for user input, which saves the value to storage when submitted.
// Step 11: The stored value is displayed below the TextField, updating dynamically as the user saves new values.
