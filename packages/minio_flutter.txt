# Minio Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview

The **minio_flutter** package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to integrate MinIO, a high-performance, S3-compatible object storage service, into their applications. This package allows developers to easily manage and interact with MinIO servers, enabling functionalities such as file uploads, downloads, and bucket management.

## When to Use This Package
- **Cloud Storage Solutions**: When you need a reliable and scalable storage solution for your Flutter app.
- **S3 Compatibility**: If your application requires S3-compatible storage but you prefer using MinIO for its performance and cost-effectiveness.
- **File Management**: For applications that involve heavy file management, such as media apps, document storage, or backup solutions.

## Key Features
- **S3 Compatibility**: Fully compatible with S3 APIs, making it easy to switch from AWS S3 to MinIO.
- **File Operations**: Supports uploading, downloading, and deleting files.
- **Bucket Management**: Create, list, and delete buckets with ease.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

With these features, the **minio_flutter** package provides a robust solution for developers looking to leverage MinIO's capabilities in their Flutter applications.

# Setting Up and Using the Minio Flutter Package

## Installation
To get started with the **minio_flutter** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  minio_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the current version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/minio_flutter).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that you have the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to upload files.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the **minio_flutter** package, you need to initialize the MinIO client and perform operations like uploading and downloading files. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:minio_flutter/minio_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final Minio minio;

  RealFlutter() : minio = Minio(
    endPoint: 'YOUR_MINIO_ENDPOINT',
    accessKey: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    secretKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    useSSL: false, // Set to true if using HTTPS
  );

  // Method to upload a file
  Future<void> uploadFile(String bucketName, String filePath) async {
    await minio.putObject(bucketName, 'object-name', filePath);
  }

  // Method to download a file
  Future<void> downloadFile(String bucketName, String objectName, String downloadPath) async {
    await minio.getObject(bucketName, objectName, downloadPath);
  }
}
```

This code initializes the MinIO client and provides methods for uploading and downloading files. Make sure to replace `YOUR_MINIO_ENDPOINT`, `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY`, and `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your actual MinIO server details.

# Complete Example of Using Minio Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:minio_flutter/minio_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'MinIO Flutter Example',
      home: MinioExample(),
    );
  }
}

class MinioExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MinioExampleState createState() => _MinioExampleState();
}

class _MinioExampleState extends State<MinioExample> {
  final Minio minio = Minio(
    endPoint: 'YOUR_MINIO_ENDPOINT',
    accessKey: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    secretKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    useSSL: false,
  );

  String bucketName = 'my-bucket';
  String filePath = 'path/to/your/file.txt'; // Local file path
  String downloadPath = 'path/to/download/file.txt'; // Download path

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    createBucket();
  }

  // Method to create a bucket
  Future<void> createBucket() async {
    try {
      await minio.makeBucket(bucketName, 'us-east-1');
      print('Bucket created successfully');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error creating bucket: $e');
    }
  }

  // Method to upload a file
  Future<void> uploadFile() async {
    try {
      await minio.putObject(bucketName, 'file.txt', filePath);
      print('File uploaded successfully');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error uploading file: $e');
    }
  }

  // Method to download a file
  Future<void> downloadFile() async {
    try {
      await minio.getObject(bucketName, 'file.txt', downloadPath);
      print('File downloaded successfully');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error downloading file: $e');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('MinIO Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: uploadFile,
              child: Text('Upload File'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: downloadFile,
              child: Text('Download File'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and home set to MinioExample.
// 3. In MinioExample, we initialize the Minio client with the server details.
// 4. On initialization, we create a bucket using the createBucket method.
// 5. The UI consists of two buttons: one for uploading a file and another for downloading a file.
// 6. When the user presses the "Upload File" button, the uploadFile method is called, which uploads the specified file to the MinIO server.
// 7. Similarly, pressing the "Download File" button calls the downloadFile method, which downloads the file from the MinIO server to the specified path.
