# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using HMSSDK Flutter

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `hmssdk_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  hmssdk_flutter: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the necessary permissions and metadata in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>

    <application
        android:label="yourapp"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.hms.sdk.appid"
            android:value="YOUR_HMS_APP_ID"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `android/build.gradle` file has the correct SDK versions:

```gradle
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.5.31'
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.0.3'
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the required permissions in your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio calls.</string>
```

2. **Podfile Configuration**: Ensure your `Podfile` is set to use the latest platform:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initialize and use the `hmssdk_flutter` package.

# Complete Example of HMSSDK Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hmssdk_flutter/hmssdk_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'HMSSDK Flutter Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  late HMSSDK hmsSDK; // Declare the HMSSDK instance
  late HMSConfig hmsConfig; // Configuration for the SDK

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the HMSSDK with your app ID
    hmsSDK = HMSSDK(appId: "YOUR_HMS_APP_ID");
    hmsConfig = HMSConfig(
      userId: "user123",
      roomId: "room123",
      token: "YOUR_HMS_TOKEN",
    );
  }

  // Function to join a room
  void joinRoom() async {
    try {
      await hmsSDK.join(hmsConfig);
      print("Joined room successfully");
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error joining room: $e");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('HMSSDK Flutter Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: joinRoom, // Call joinRoom on button press
          child: Text('Join Room'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The HomeScreen widget is displayed, where the HMSSDK is initialized with the app ID.
// 3. When the user presses the "Join Room" button, the joinRoom function is called.
// 4. The joinRoom function attempts to join a room using the provided configuration.
// 5. If successful, a message is printed to the console; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
```

In this example, we have created a simple Flutter application that initializes the `hmssdk_flutter` package and allows users to join a video conferencing room. The application flow is straightforward: it initializes the SDK, sets up the necessary configurations, and provides a button for users to join a room. The comments within the code explain each step of the process, making it easy to follow along. 

This blog provides a comprehensive overview of the `hmssdk_flutter` package, guiding you through its features, setup, and usage in a Flutter application.
