# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_tabler_icons

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_tabler_icons` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_tabler_icons` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_tabler_icons: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_tabler_icons/flutter_tabler_icons.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Icons

You can now use the icons in your Flutter widgets. Here’s a simple example of how to use an icon in a `Container` widget:

```dart
Container(
  child: Icon(
    TablerIcons.home, // Using the home icon from Tabler Icons
    size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
    color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
  ),
)
```

## Platform-Specific Details

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Customizing Icons

You can customize the icons further by adjusting their size and color properties. Here’s an example of a button with an icon:

```dart
ElevatedButton.icon(
  onPressed: () {},
  icon: Icon(TablerIcons.settings, size: 24.0, color: Colors.white),
  label: Text('Settings'),
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(primary: Colors.green),
)
```

This button will display a settings icon alongside the text "Settings".

With these steps, you should be able to integrate and use the `flutter_tabler_icons` package in your Flutter application effectively.
