# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Overlay Tutorial Package

## Installation
To get started with the `overlay_tutorial` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  overlay_tutorial: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your overlays require any specific permissions (like camera or location).

## Basic Usage
To use the `overlay_tutorial` package, you will typically follow these steps:
1. Import the package in your Dart file.
2. Create an overlay using the provided methods.
3. Display the overlay at the desired position.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create an overlay:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:overlay_tutorial/overlay_tutorial.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Overlay Tutorial')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create and show the overlay when the button is pressed
              OverlayTutorial.showOverlay(
                context: context,
                message: 'This is an overlay message!',
                position: OverlayPosition.top, // Position the overlay at the top
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Overlay'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, an overlay with a message appears at the top of the screen.

# Complete Example of Using Overlay Tutorial Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:overlay_tutorial/overlay_tutorial.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Overlay Tutorial')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Create and show the overlay when the button is pressed
              OverlayTutorial.showOverlay(
                context: context,
                message: 'This is an overlay message!',
                position: OverlayPosition.top, // Position the overlay at the top
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Overlay'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which builds a MaterialApp.
// 2. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. The Center widget contains an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. Inside the callback, the OverlayTutorial.showOverlay method is called.
// 6. This method takes the current context, a message to display, and the position of the overlay.
// 7. The overlay appears at the top of the screen with the specified message.
// 8. The user can dismiss the overlay by tapping outside of it or after a certain duration, depending on the package's configuration.
