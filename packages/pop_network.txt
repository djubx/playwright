# Overview of the pop_network Flutter Package

The `pop_network` package is a powerful tool designed for Flutter developers to simplify network requests and handle responses efficiently. It provides a streamlined way to manage API calls, making it easier to integrate with RESTful services. This package is particularly useful when building applications that require frequent data fetching from the internet, such as social media apps, e-commerce platforms, or any app that relies on dynamic content.

## Key Features
- **Simplified API Calls**: Easily make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests with minimal boilerplate code.
- **Response Handling**: Automatically parse JSON responses into Dart objects, reducing the need for manual parsing.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to handle network errors and exceptions gracefully.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of headers, query parameters, and request timeouts.
- **Support for Interceptors**: Enables the use of interceptors for logging, modifying requests, or handling responses before they reach the application.

## When to Use
- When you need to make multiple network requests in your Flutter application.
- If you want to reduce the complexity of handling HTTP requests and responses.
- When you require a robust error handling mechanism for network operations.

Overall, `pop_network` is an excellent choice for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with efficient network capabilities.

# Setting Up and Using the pop_network Package

## Installation
To get started with the `pop_network` package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pop_network: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to add permissions for network access in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the `pop_network` package, you can create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class, which will handle your network requests. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to make a GET request:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pop_network/pop_network.dart';

class RealFlutter {
  final PopNetwork _network = PopNetwork();

  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    try {
      final response = await _network.get('https://api.example.com/data');
      // Handle the response
      print(response.data);
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle errors
      print('Error: $e');
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of `PopNetwork` and use it to make a GET request. The response is printed to the console, and any errors are caught and printed as well.

With this setup, you can easily expand your application to include more complex network interactions, such as POST requests or handling query parameters.

# Complete Example of Using pop_network

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pop_network/pop_network.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pop Network Example',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  final RealFlutter _realFlutter = RealFlutter();
  String _data = 'Fetching data...';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchData(); // Fetch data when the widget is initialized
  }

  Future<void> _fetchData() async {
    try {
      // Call the fetchData method from RealFlutter class
      final response = await _realFlutter.fetchData();
      setState(() {
        _data = response.data; // Update the UI with the fetched data
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _data = 'Error fetching data: $e'; // Update the UI with the error message
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pop Network Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(_data), // Display the fetched data or error message
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter {
  final PopNetwork _network = PopNetwork();

  Future<dynamic> fetchData() async {
    // Make a GET request to the API
    final response = await _network.get('https://api.example.com/data');
    return response; // Return the response data
  }
}
```

```dart
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and directs to the HomePage widget.
// In HomePage, we initialize the RealFlutter class to handle network requests.
// The _fetchData method is called in initState to fetch data when the widget is created.
// Inside _fetchData, we call fetchData from RealFlutter, which makes a GET request.
// If the request is successful, we update the _data variable with the response data.
// If there's an error, we catch it and update _data with an error message.
// The build method displays the fetched data or error message in the center of the screen.
```
