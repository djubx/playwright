```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hicons/flutter_hicons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Hicons Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Hicons Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display a red heart icon with a size of 48 pixels
              Icon(Hicons.heart, size: 48, color: Colors.red),
              SizedBox(height: 16),
              // Display a blue star icon with a size of 24 pixels
              Icon(Hicons.star, size: 24, color: Colors.blue),
              SizedBox(height: 16),
              // Display a green checkmark icon with a size of 36 pixels
              Icon(Hicons.checkmark, size: 36, color: Colors.green),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, and the `RealFlutter` widget is displayed.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget builds a `MaterialApp` with a `Scaffold` as its home.
// 3. The `Scaffold` has an `AppBar` with a title, and a `Center` widget as its body.
// 4. The `Center` widget contains a `Column` with three `Icon` widgets.
// 5. Each `Icon` widget displays a different icon (heart, star, and checkmark) with a specific size and color.
// 6. The icons are spaced evenly apart using `SizedBox` widgets.
```

// In summary, this code demonstrates how to use the `flutter_hicons` package to display icons in a Flutter app. The app displays three icons with different sizes and colors, and the icons are spaced evenly apart. The code is well-structured and easy to follow, making it a great example for developers who want to learn how to use the `flutter_hicons` package.
