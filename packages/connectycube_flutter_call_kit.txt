# Tutorial: Setting Up Connectycube Flutter Call Kit

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `connectycube_flutter_call_kit` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependencies

First, add the `connectycube_flutter_call_kit` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  connectycube_flutter_call_kit: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

2. **Enable ProGuard**: If you are using ProGuard, ensure that you add the necessary rules to keep the ConnectyCube classes.

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys for camera and microphone usage:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for video calls.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for audio calls.</string>
```

2. **Enable Background Modes**: In Xcode, go to your project settings, select the "Capabilities" tab, and enable "Background Modes". Check "Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture".

## Step 3: Initialize ConnectyCube

In your main Dart file, initialize ConnectyCube with your application credentials:

```dart
import 'package:connectycube_flutter_call_kit/connectycube_flutter_call_kit.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  ConnectycubeFlutterCallKit.init(
    appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
    authKey: 'YOUR_AUTH_KEY',
    authSecret: 'YOUR_AUTH_SECRET',
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

Replace `YOUR_APP_ID`, `YOUR_AUTH_KEY`, and `YOUR_AUTH_SECRET` with your actual ConnectyCube credentials.

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to create and manage calls. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate a call:

```dart
void startCall(String userId) {
  ConnectycubeFlutterCallKit.startCall(
    userId: userId,
    callType: CallType.video, // or CallType.audio
  );
}
```

This function can be triggered by a button press or any other event in your app.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `connectycube_flutter_call_kit` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example: Flutter Application Using Connectycube Flutter Call Kit

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:connectycube_flutter_call_kit/connectycube_flutter_call_kit.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize ConnectyCube with your credentials
  ConnectycubeFlutterCallKit.init(
    appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
    authKey: 'YOUR_AUTH_KEY',
    authSecret: 'YOUR_AUTH_SECRET',
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'ConnectyCube Call Kit Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CallHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class CallHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('ConnectyCube Call Kit'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Start a call with a specific user ID
            startCall('USER_ID'); // Replace with actual user ID
          },
          child: Text('Start Video Call'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void startCall(String userId) {
    // Start a video call with the specified user ID
    ConnectycubeFlutterCallKit.startCall(
      userId: userId,
      callType: CallType.video, // Specify call type (audio/video)
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app initializes ConnectyCube with the provided credentials.
// 2. The main screen displays a button to start a video call.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the `startCall` function is invoked.
// 4. The `startCall` function uses the ConnectyCube API to initiate a call with the specified user ID.
// 5. The user can then engage in a video call with the other participant.
```

<!-- END_MAIN -->

In this example, we created a simple Flutter application that initializes the ConnectyCube Call Kit and provides a button to start a video call. The application flow is straightforward: upon pressing the button, a call is initiated with the specified user ID. This demonstrates the core functionality of the `connectycube_flutter_call_kit` package, allowing developers to easily integrate calling features into their applications.
