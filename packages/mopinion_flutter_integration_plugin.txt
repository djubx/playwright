# Tutorial: Setting Up the Mopinion Flutter Integration Plugin

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `mopinion_flutter_integration_plugin` and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `mopinion_flutter_integration_plugin` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mopinion_flutter_integration_plugin: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourapp">

    <application
        ...
        android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"> <!-- Allow cleartext traffic if needed -->
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Plugin

In your main Dart file, import the package and initialize it:

```dart
import 'package:mopinion_flutter_integration_plugin/mopinion_flutter_integration_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  MopinionFlutterIntegrationPlugin.initialize('YOUR_MOPINION_API_KEY'); // Replace with your API key
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Plugin

You can now use the plugin to show surveys or collect feedback. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to trigger a survey:

```dart
MopinionFlutterIntegrationPlugin.showSurvey('SURVEY_ID'); // Replace with your survey ID
```

This will display the survey to the user based on the ID provided.

With these steps, you have successfully integrated the `mopinion_flutter_integration_plugin` into your Flutter application. You can now start collecting valuable user feedback!

# Complete Example of Mopinion Flutter Integration Plugin

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mopinion_flutter_integration_plugin/mopinion_flutter_integration_plugin.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize the Mopinion plugin with your API key
  MopinionFlutterIntegrationPlugin.initialize('YOUR_MOPINION_API_KEY'); // Replace with your API key
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Mopinion Integration Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Mopinion Feedback Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Show the survey when the button is pressed
            MopinionFlutterIntegrationPlugin.showSurvey('SURVEY_ID'); // Replace with your survey ID
          },
          child: Text('Give Feedback'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, initializing the Mopinion plugin with the provided API key.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget is displayed as the home screen of the app.
// 4. In the HomeScreen, there is a button labeled "Give Feedback".
// 5. When the button is pressed, the Mopinion survey is triggered using the showSurvey method with the specified survey ID.
// 6. Users can then provide their feedback through the displayed survey.
