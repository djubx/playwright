Here's a detailed technical blog on the "screen_capture_event" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Screen Capture Event Flutter Package

The `screen_capture_event` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed for developers who need to capture screen events in their Flutter applications. This package allows you to listen for screen capture events, which can be particularly useful in applications that require monitoring of screen sharing or recording activities. 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using the `screen_capture_event` package in scenarios such as:
- **Security Applications**: To monitor unauthorized screen captures.
- **Educational Apps**: To prevent cheating during online exams by detecting screen sharing.
- **Content Creation Tools**: To provide users with notifications when their screen is being recorded.

## Features
- **Event Listening**: Listen for screen capture events in real-time.
- **Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS.
- **Custom Callbacks**: Allows developers to define custom actions when a screen capture event is detected.

This package is essential for any Flutter application that requires awareness of screen capture activities, enhancing both security and user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Screen Capture Event Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, you need to add the `screen_capture_event` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  screen_capture_event: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/screen_capture_event).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for screen recording:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for screen recording.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for screen recording.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package
Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to listen for screen capture events.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:screen_capture_event/screen_capture_event.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _captureStatus = "Unknown";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start listening for screen capture events
    ScreenCaptureEvent.onScreenCaptureChanged.listen((isCaptured) {
      setState(() {
        _captureStatus = isCaptured ? "Screen is being captured!" : "Screen capture stopped.";
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the event listener when the widget is removed
    ScreenCaptureEvent.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Screen Capture Event Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(_captureStatus, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we listen for screen capture events and update the UI accordingly. The `ScreenCaptureEvent.onScreenCaptureChanged` stream provides a boolean value indicating whether the screen is currently being captured.

# Complete Example: RealFlutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:screen_capture_event/screen_capture_event.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _captureStatus = "Unknown"; // Variable to hold the capture status

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Start listening for screen capture events
    ScreenCaptureEvent.onScreenCaptureChanged.listen((isCaptured) {
      setState(() {
        // Update the capture status based on the event
        _captureStatus = isCaptured ? "Screen is being captured!" : "Screen capture stopped.";
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the event listener when the widget is removed
    ScreenCaptureEvent.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Screen Capture Event Example")), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Text(_captureStatus, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24)), // Display capture status
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we initialize a state variable _captureStatus to keep track of the screen capture status.
// 3. In the initState method, we set up a listener for screen capture events using ScreenCaptureEvent.onScreenCaptureChanged.
// 4. When a screen capture event occurs, we update the _captureStatus variable and call setState to refresh the UI.
// 5. The build method returns a Scaffold widget with an AppBar and a Center widget displaying the current capture status.
// 6. When the widget is disposed, we clean up by calling ScreenCaptureEvent.dispose() to remove the listener.
