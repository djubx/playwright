# Chalk Flutter Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To get started with the Chalk package, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  chalk: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/chalk).

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No specific configurations are required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`.

## Basic Usage
To use the Chalk package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:chalk/chalk.dart';
```

You can then create styled text using the `Chalk` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
Text(
  Chalk('Hello, World!')
    .color(Colors.blue)
    .bold()
    .italic()
    .toString(),
)
```

This will display "Hello, World!" in blue, bold, and italicized text.

## Example of Advanced Usage
You can also combine multiple styles and colors:

```dart
Text(
  Chalk('Flutter ')
    .color(Colors.green)
    .bold()
    .toString() +
  Chalk('is awesome!')
    .color(Colors.red)
    .italic()
    .toString(),
)
```

This example will display "Flutter" in green and bold, followed by "is awesome!" in red and italic.

With these steps, you can easily integrate the Chalk package into your Flutter applications and start creating beautifully styled text.

# Complete Example of Using Chalk in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chalk/chalk.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Chalk Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Chalk Package Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Displaying styled text using Chalk
              Text(
                Chalk('Welcome to ')
                  .color(Colors.blue)
                  .bold()
                  .toString() +
                Chalk('Chalk!')
                  .color(Colors.red)
                  .italic()
                  .toString(),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between text
              // Another example of styled text
              Text(
                Chalk('Enjoy creating beautiful text!')
                  .color(Colors.green)
                  .underline()
                  .toString(),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the text widgets vertically.
// 5. The first Text widget combines two styled texts: "Welcome to" in blue and bold, and "Chalk!" in red and italic.
// 6. A SizedBox is used to add space between the two text widgets.
// 7. The second Text widget displays "Enjoy creating beautiful text!" in green and underlined.
// 8. The app showcases how to use the Chalk package to create visually appealing text.
