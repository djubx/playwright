# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_tinder_swipe

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_tinder_swipe` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `flutter_tinder_swipe` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_tinder_swipe: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_tinder_swipe).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy

    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}

# Complete Example of flutter_tinder_swipe

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_tinder_swipe/flutter_tinder_swipe.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Tinder Swipe Example',
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // List of cards to display
  final List<String> cards = [
    'Card 1',
    'Card 2',
    'Card 3',
    'Card 4',
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Tinder Swipe Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: TinderSwipe(
          // List of widgets to swipe
          cards: cards.map((card) {
            return Card(
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  card,
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                ),
              ),
            );
          }).toList(),
          // Callback for when a card is swiped
          onSwipe: (index, direction) {
            print('Card $index swiped to the $direction');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app and sets MyApp as the home widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets RealFlutter as the home screen.
// 3. RealFlutter is a StatefulWidget that maintains a list of cards to display.
// 4. In the build method, a Scaffold is created with an AppBar and a body containing the TinderSwipe widget.
// 5. The TinderSwipe widget takes a list of cards and a callback function that prints the index and direction of the swiped card.
// 6. As users swipe through the cards, the onSwipe callback is triggered, allowing for custom actions based on user interactions.
```
