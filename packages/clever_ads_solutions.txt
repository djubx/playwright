# Tutorial: Setting Up Clever Ads Solutions

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Clever Ads Solutions package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the Clever Ads Solutions package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  clever_ads_solutions: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the necessary permissions and metadata for the ad networks you plan to use. For example:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        <!-- Add this inside the <application> tag -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.cleverads.sdk.APP_ID"
            android:value="YOUR_APP_ID" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the required keys for ad networks. For example:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Package

In your main Dart file, initialize the Clever Ads Solutions package. You can do this in the `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:clever_ads_solutions/clever_ads_solutions.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  CleverAdsSolutions.initialize("YOUR_APP_ID");
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Displaying Ads

You can now display ads in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to show a banner ad:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Clever Ads Solutions Example")),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text("Welcome to Clever Ads Solutions!"),
              CleverBannerAd(), // Displaying a banner ad
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Testing Ads

Make sure to test your ads in both debug and release modes. Use test ads during development to avoid policy violations.

# Complete Example of Clever Ads Solutions

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:clever_ads_solutions/clever_ads_solutions.dart';

void main() {
  // Ensure Flutter binding is initialized before running the app
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Initialize the Clever Ads Solutions with your app ID
  CleverAdsSolutions.initialize("YOUR_APP_ID");
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Clever Ads Solutions Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  // Variable to hold the banner ad
  CleverBannerAd? _bannerAd;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load the banner ad when the screen initializes
    _bannerAd = CleverBannerAd(
      adUnitId: "YOUR_BANNER_AD_UNIT_ID",
      listener: (CleverAdEvent event) {
        // Handle ad events (loaded, failed, etc.)
        if (event == CleverAdEvent.loaded) {
          print("Banner Ad Loaded");
        } else if (event == CleverAdEvent.failedToLoad) {
          print("Failed to load Banner Ad");
        }
      },
    );
    _bannerAd!.load(); // Load the ad
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _bannerAd?.dispose(); // Dispose of the ad when the screen is disposed
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Clever Ads Solutions Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text("Welcome to Clever Ads Solutions!"),
            // Display the banner ad if it's loaded
            if (_bannerAd != null) _bannerAd!,
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main() function, initializing the Clever Ads Solutions package.
// 2. The MyApp widget is created, which sets up the MaterialApp and HomeScreen.
// 3. In HomeScreen, a CleverBannerAd is instantiated and loaded in initState.
// 4. The ad listener handles events like loading success or failure.
// 5. The banner ad is displayed in the UI if it is loaded successfully.
// 6. When the HomeScreen is disposed, the banner ad is also disposed to free resources.
```
