# Setting Up the Steamworks Flutter Package

To get started with the Steamworks package, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the Steamworks package:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     steamworks: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/steamworks).

2. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**:
     - Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. You may need to add internet permissions if your app requires network access.
     - Configure your app to use the Steamworks API by following the specific setup instructions provided in the package documentation.

   - **iOS**:
     - For iOS, you will need to configure your app's `Info.plist` to include any required permissions and settings for using the Steamworks API.
     - Make sure to set up your app's bundle identifier to match the one registered with Steam.

## Usage

Once you have installed the package and configured your project, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to authenticate a user and fetch their achievements.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:steamworks/steamworks.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _userName = '';
  List<String> _achievements = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _authenticateUser();
  }

  void _authenticateUser() async {
    // Authenticate the user with Steam
    var user = await Steamworks.authenticate();
    setState(() {
      _userName = user.name;
    });
    _fetchAchievements();
  }

  void _fetchAchievements() async {
    // Fetch user achievements
    var achievements = await Steamworks.getAchievements();
    setState(() {
      _achievements = achievements;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Steamworks Example')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Text('Welcome, $_userName'),
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: _achievements.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(title: Text(_achievements[index]));
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we authenticate the user and fetch their achievements from Steam. The user’s name and achievements are displayed in a simple UI.

# Complete Example of Steamworks Integration

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:steamworks/steamworks.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _userName = ''; // Variable to store the user's name
  List<String> _achievements = []; // List to store user achievements

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _authenticateUser(); // Call the authentication method on initialization
  }

  void _authenticateUser() async {
    // Authenticate the user with Steam
    var user = await Steamworks.authenticate(); // Call the authenticate method
    setState(() {
      _userName = user.name; // Update the username state
    });
    _fetchAchievements(); // Fetch achievements after authentication
  }

  void _fetchAchievements() async {
    // Fetch user achievements
    var achievements = await Steamworks.getAchievements(); // Call the getAchievements method
    setState(() {
      _achievements = achievements; // Update the achievements state
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Steamworks Example')), // App bar with title
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Text('Welcome, $_userName'), // Display the user's name
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: _achievements.length, // Set the number of items in the list
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(title: Text(_achievements[index])); // Display each achievement
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. In the initState method, _authenticateUser is called to authenticate the user with Steam.
// 3. Upon successful authentication, the user's name is stored in _userName and the _fetchAchievements method is called.
// 4. _fetchAchievements retrieves the user's achievements from Steam and updates the _achievements list.
// 5. The UI displays a welcome message with the user's name and lists their achievements in a scrollable view.
