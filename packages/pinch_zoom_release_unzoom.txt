# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Pinch Zoom Release Unzoom Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **pinch_zoom_release_unzoom** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  pinch_zoom_release_unzoom: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to enable certain permissions in your `Info.plist` file, especially if you are using images from the internet. Add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to display images.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take pictures.</string>
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement pinch zoom functionality.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pinch_zoom_release_unzoom/pinch_zoom_release_unzoom.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pinch Zoom Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: PinchZoomReleaseUnzoom(
            child: Image.network('https://example.com/image.jpg'),
            // Set the maximum and minimum zoom levels
            maxScale: 3.0,
            minScale: 1.0,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that displays an image. The `PinchZoomReleaseUnzoom` widget wraps the image, allowing users to pinch to zoom in and out.

# Complete Example of Pinch Zoom Release Unzoom

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pinch_zoom_release_unzoom/pinch_zoom_release_unzoom.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pinch Zoom Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: PinchZoomReleaseUnzoom(
            child: Image.network('https://example.com/image.jpg'), // Load an image from the network
            maxScale: 3.0, // Set the maximum zoom level
            minScale: 1.0, // Set the minimum zoom level
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Start the application
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, we use the PinchZoomReleaseUnzoom widget to wrap an Image widget.
// 4. The Image widget loads an image from the specified URL.
// 5. The PinchZoomReleaseUnzoom widget enables pinch-to-zoom functionality, allowing users to zoom in up to 3x and zoom out to the original size.
// 6. Users can interact with the image using pinch gestures, enhancing the overall user experience.
