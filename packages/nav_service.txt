# Overview of the nav_service Flutter Package

The `nav_service` package is a powerful tool designed to simplify navigation management in Flutter applications. It provides a centralized way to handle navigation, making it easier to manage routes and transitions between screens. This package is particularly useful in larger applications where managing navigation can become complex.

## When to Use `nav_service`
- **Complex Applications**: When your app has multiple screens and nested navigation, `nav_service` helps maintain a clean and manageable navigation structure.
- **State Management**: If you are using state management solutions like Provider or Riverpod, `nav_service` integrates seamlessly, allowing you to navigate based on state changes.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: When your app requires dynamic routing based on user actions or data, this package provides the flexibility needed.

## Key Features
- **Centralized Navigation**: Manage all navigation actions from a single service.
- **Named Routes**: Easily define and use named routes throughout your application.
- **Parameter Passing**: Pass parameters between screens effortlessly.
- **Custom Transitions**: Implement custom animations for screen transitions.
- **Integration with State Management**: Works well with popular state management solutions.

# Setting Up and Using the nav_service Package

## Installation
To get started with `nav_service`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  nav_service: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/nav_service).

## Configuration
### Android
No specific configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Basic Usage
1. **Create a Navigation Service**: You will need to create an instance of the navigation service.
2. **Define Routes**: Set up your routes in the main application file.
3. **Use the Service**: Call the navigation methods from anywhere in your app.

### Example Setup
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nav_service/nav_service.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      navigatorKey: NavService.navigatorKey, // Set the navigator key
      initialRoute: '/',
      routes: {
        '/': (context) => HomeScreen(),
        '/second': (context) => SecondScreen(),
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we set up a basic Flutter application with two routes: the home screen and a second screen. The `NavService` is initialized with a navigator key, allowing us to navigate from anywhere in the app.

# Complete Example of Using nav_service

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nav_service/nav_service.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      navigatorKey: NavService.navigatorKey, // Set the navigator key for global access
      initialRoute: '/', // Define the initial route
      routes: {
        '/': (context) => HomeScreen(), // Home screen route
        '/second': (context) => SecondScreen(), // Second screen route
      },
    );
  }
}

// HomeScreen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Navigate to the second screen using nav_service
            NavService.navigateTo('/second', arguments: 'Hello from Home!');
          },
          child: Text('Go to Second Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// SecondScreen widget
class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Retrieve arguments passed from the first screen
    final String message = NavService.getArguments<String>() ?? 'No message';

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Second Screen')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(message), // Display the message
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The navigatorKey is assigned to NavService.navigatorKey for global access.
// 3. The initial route is set to the HomeScreen.
// 4. The HomeScreen contains a button that, when pressed, calls NavService.navigateTo() to navigate to the SecondScreen.
// 5. The SecondScreen retrieves the passed arguments using NavService.getArguments() and displays them on the screen.
