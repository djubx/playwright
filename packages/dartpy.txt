# Overview of the dartpy Flutter Package

The `dartpy` package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the integration of Dart code with Python. This package is particularly useful for developers who want to leverage existing Python libraries or functionalities within their Flutter applications. By bridging the gap between Dart and Python, `dartpy` allows for seamless communication and data exchange, making it an excellent choice for projects that require complex computations or data processing typically handled by Python.

## When to Use `dartpy`
- **Data Science Applications**: If your Flutter app requires advanced data analysis or machine learning capabilities, you can utilize Python libraries like NumPy or Pandas through `dartpy`.
- **Existing Python Codebases**: If you have a legacy Python application that you want to integrate with a Flutter frontend, `dartpy` can help you reuse that code.
- **Complex Algorithms**: For applications that need to implement complex algorithms that are easier to write in Python, `dartpy` provides a straightforward way to do so.

## Key Features
- **Interoperability**: Easily call Python functions from Dart and vice versa.
- **Data Serialization**: Automatically handles data serialization between Dart and Python types.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Supports asynchronous operations, allowing for non-blocking calls to Python code.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Android and iOS, making it versatile for mobile app development.

# Setting Up and Using the dartpy Package

## Installation
To get started with `dartpy`, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dartpy: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dartpy).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if your Python code requires network access or other permissions.

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add any required permissions, such as:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

2. Ensure that your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '10.0'
   ```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed and configured `dartpy`, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to call a Python function from Dart.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dartpy/dartpy.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('DartPy Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Call the Python function
              var result = await RealFlutter.callPythonFunction();
              print('Result from Python: $result');
            },
            child: Text('Call Python Function'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter {
  static Future<String> callPythonFunction() async {
    // Assuming you have a Python function that returns a string
    var pythonResult = await DartPy.call('my_python_function');
    return pythonResult;
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, it calls a Python function named `my_python_function` and prints the result.

# Complete Example of Using dartpy

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dartpy/dartpy.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('DartPy Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Call the Python function
              var result = await RealFlutter.callPythonFunction();
              print('Result from Python: $result');
            },
            child: Text('Call Python Function'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter {
  static Future<String> callPythonFunction() async {
    // Call the Python function named 'my_python_function'
    var pythonResult = await DartPy.call('my_python_function');
    return pythonResult; // Return the result back to the caller
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 3. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback.
// 5. The callback calls the static method callPythonFunction from the RealFlutter class.
// 6. Inside callPythonFunction, the DartPy.call method is used to invoke a Python function named 'my_python_function'.
// 7. The result from the Python function is awaited and returned to the button's onPressed callback.
// 8. Finally, the result is printed to the console.
```
