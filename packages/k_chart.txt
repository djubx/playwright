# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using k_chart

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  k_chart: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/k_chart).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the k_chart package:

```dart
import 'package:k_chart/k_chart.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using k_chart in Your Application

You can now use the k_chart package to create charts. Below is a simple example of how to implement a candlestick chart.

# Complete Example of k_chart in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:k_chart/k_chart.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'K Chart Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('K Chart Example'),
        ),
        body: ChartScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ChartScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample data for the candlestick chart
    List<CandleEntity> data = [
      CandleEntity(DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 5)), 100, 110, 90, 105, 1000),
      CandleEntity(DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 4)), 105, 115, 95, 110, 1200),
      CandleEntity(DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 3)), 110, 120, 100, 115, 1500),
      CandleEntity(DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 2)), 115, 125, 105, 120, 1300),
      CandleEntity(DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(days: 1)), 120, 130, 110, 125, 1400),
    ];

    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
      child: KChartWidget(
        data: data,
        mainState: MainState.MA,
        isLine: true,
        isShowVolume: true,
        volumeState: VolumeState.VOL,
        // Customize the chart appearance
        chartStyle: ChartStyle(
          gridColor: Colors.grey,
          upColor: Colors.green,
          downColor: Colors.red,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The home screen contains an AppBar and a ChartScreen widget.
// 4. The ChartScreen widget creates a list of CandleEntity objects representing the candlestick data.
// 5. The KChartWidget is used to display the candlestick chart, with options for line display and volume.
// 6. The chart's appearance is customized using the ChartStyle class.
```
