# Balanced Text Flutter Package

The **balanced_text** Flutter package is designed to help developers create visually appealing text layouts in their applications. It provides a way to balance text across multiple lines, ensuring that the text appears evenly distributed and aesthetically pleasing. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where text needs to fit within a specific area, such as in news articles, product descriptions, or any content-heavy applications.

## When to Use This Package

You might consider using the **balanced_text** package in the following scenarios:

- **Content-heavy Applications**: When displaying large amounts of text, such as articles or blogs, where readability and aesthetics are crucial.
- **Dynamic Text Layouts**: In applications where text content can change dynamically, and you want to maintain a consistent look.
- **Custom Text Styling**: When you need more control over how text is displayed, including line spacing, alignment, and overall balance.

## Features

- **Automatic Text Balancing**: The package automatically adjusts the text layout to ensure even distribution across lines.
- **Customizable Styles**: You can customize the text style, including font size, weight, and color.
- **Responsive Design**: The text layout adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, making it suitable for both mobile and tablet applications.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Balanced Text Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **balanced_text** package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  balanced_text: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the **balanced_text** package in your app.

# Complete Example of Using the Balanced Text Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:balanced_text/balanced_text.dart'; // Import the balanced_text package

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter application
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Balanced Text Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Balanced Text Demo'), // App bar title
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0), // Padding around the text
            child: BalancedText(
              'This is an example of how to use the balanced_text package in Flutter. '
              'It helps to create a visually appealing text layout that is balanced and easy to read.',
              style: TextStyle(
                fontSize: 18, // Font size of the text
                color: Colors.black, // Text color
              ),
              textAlign: TextAlign.justify, // Justify text alignment
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Balanced Text Demo'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold is centered and contains a Padding widget to add space around the text.
// 5. Inside the Padding, the BalancedText widget is used to display a sample text.
// 6. The text is styled with a specific font size and color, and it is justified for better readability.
```
