```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:angel3_jael/angel3_jael.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Initialize the Angel3 Jael package
  final _jael = Angel3Jael();

  // Define a state variable to store the data
  List<String> _data = [];

  // Define a function to fetch the data
  Future<void> _fetchData() async {
    // Use the Angel3 Jael package to fetch the data
    final response = await _jael.get('https://api.example.com/data');

    // Update the state with the fetched data
    setState(() {
      _data = response.data;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Real Flutter',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Real Flutter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display the fetched data
              Text(_data.join('\n')),
              // Fetch the data when the button is pressed
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: _fetchData,
                child: Text('Fetch Data'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user presses the "Fetch Data" button.
// 2. The `_fetchData` function is called, which uses the Angel3 Jael package to fetch the data from the API.
// 3. The fetched data is stored in the `_data` state variable.
// 4. The `build` function is called again to update the UI with the fetched data.
// 5. The fetched data is displayed on the screen.

// In summary, the Angel3 Jael package is used to fetch the data from the API and store it in the state variable. The UI is then updated to display the fetched data.
