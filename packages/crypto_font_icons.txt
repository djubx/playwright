```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:crypto_font_icons/crypto_font_icons.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a MaterialApp to wrap our app
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Crypto Font Icons Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Crypto Font Icons Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display the Bitcoin icon
              Icon(CryptoFontIcons.bitcoin, size: 50),
              Text('Bitcoin'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display the Ethereum icon
              Icon(CryptoFontIcons.ethereum, size: 50),
              Text('Ethereum'),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display the Litecoin icon
              Icon(CryptoFontIcons.litecoin, size: 50),
              Text('Litecoin'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app, which displays a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 2. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Crypto Font Icons Demo'.
// 3. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child.
// 4. The child of the Center widget is a Column, which displays its children vertically.
// 5. The Column contains three Icon widgets, each displaying a different cryptocurrency icon.
// 6. Below each icon is a Text widget displaying the name of the cryptocurrency.
// 7. The icons and text are spaced out using SizedBox widgets.

// In summary, this code creates a simple Flutter app that displays a few cryptocurrency icons and their names.
```
