// The app starts by creating a cancellation token and a cancellable operation.
// When the user presses the 'Start Operation' button, the operation is started.
// When the user presses the 'Cancel Operation' button, the operation is cancelled using the cancellation token.
// The cancellable operation simulates a long-running operation by delaying for 10 seconds.
// After the delay, the operation checks if it has been cancelled using the cancellation token.
// If the operation has been cancelled, it prints 'Operation cancelled' to the console.
// If the operation has not been cancelled, it prints 'Operation completed' to the console.
