# Setting Up and Using the `colored_print` Package

## Installation
To use the `colored_print` package in your Flutter project, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  colored_print: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `colored_print` package is designed to work seamlessly across both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional configurations required for either platform, making it straightforward to implement.

## Basic Usage
Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your Dart files. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use `colored_print`:

```dart
import 'package:colored_print/colored_print.dart';

void main() {
  // Print a message in red color
  coloredPrint('This is an error message!', color: Colors.red);
  
  // Print a message in green color
  coloredPrint('This is an info message!', color: Colors.green);
}
```

In this example, we import the package and use the `coloredPrint` function to print messages in different colors. You can customize the colors and styles as needed.

# Complete Example of Using `colored_print`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:colored_print/colored_print.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // The main widget of the application
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Colored Print Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Colored Print Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Print a success message in green when the button is pressed
              coloredPrint('Button Pressed: Success!', color: Colors.green);
            },
            child: Text('Press Me'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, there is an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it triggers the onPressed callback.
// 6. The onPressed callback uses the coloredPrint function to print a success message in green color to the console.
// 7. This allows developers to see the output in the console when the button is pressed, demonstrating the use of the colored_print package.
