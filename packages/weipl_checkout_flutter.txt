# Tutorial: Setting Up Weipl Checkout Flutter

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **weipl_checkout_flutter** package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency
To get started, add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  weipl_checkout_flutter: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21  // Minimum SDK version required
    }
}
```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. Ensure your iOS deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Package
In your main Dart file, import the package and initialize it:

```dart
import 'package:weipl_checkout_flutter/weipl_checkout_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now use the package to create a checkout process. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initiate a payment:

```dart
void initiatePayment() async {
  final result = await WeiplCheckoutFlutter.startCheckout(
    amount: 1000, // Amount in the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents)
    currency: 'USD',
    orderId: 'order_12345',
  );

  if (result.success) {
    // Handle successful payment
  } else {
    // Handle payment failure
  }
}
```

With these steps, you have successfully set up the **weipl_checkout_flutter** package in your Flutter application. You can now implement payment processing with ease.

# Complete Example of Weipl Checkout Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:weipl_checkout_flutter/weipl_checkout_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Weipl Checkout Example',
      home: CheckoutPage(),
    );
  }
}

class CheckoutPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Checkout'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            initiatePayment();
          },
          child: Text('Pay Now'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void initiatePayment() async {
    // Start the checkout process
    final result = await WeiplCheckoutFlutter.startCheckout(
      amount: 1000, // Amount in the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents)
      currency: 'USD',
      orderId: 'order_12345',
    );

    // Check the result of the payment
    if (result.success) {
      // Payment was successful
      print('Payment Successful: ${result.transactionId}');
    } else {
      // Payment failed
      print('Payment Failed: ${result.errorMessage}');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home page is set to CheckoutPage, which contains a button to initiate payment.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the initiatePayment function is called.
// 4. The initiatePayment function calls the startCheckout method from the WeiplCheckoutFlutter package.
// 5. The payment amount, currency, and order ID are passed to the method.
// 6. The result of the payment is checked, and appropriate actions are taken based on success or failure.
```
