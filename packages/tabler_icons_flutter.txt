        ),
        body: Center(

# Complete Example of Tabler Icons in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tabler_icons_flutter/tabler_icons_flutter.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Tabler Icons Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, // Centering the column
            children: <Widget>[
              Icon(
                TablerIcons.home, // Using the home icon from Tabler Icons
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.blue, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              Icon(
                TablerIcons.settings, // Using the settings icon from Tabler Icons
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.green, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20), // Adding space between icons
              Icon(
                TablerIcons.user, // Using the user icon from Tabler Icons
                size: 50.0, // Setting the size of the icon
                color: Colors.red, // Setting the color of the icon
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Running the RealFlutter app
}
```

// The above code defines a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the Tabler Icons package.
// 1. We start by importing the necessary packages: `flutter/material.dart` for Flutter widgets and `tabler_icons_flutter` for the icons.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` class extends `StatelessWidget`, which means it does not maintain any state.
// 3. In the `build` method, we create a `MaterialApp` with a `Scaffold` that contains an `AppBar` and a `Center` widget.
// 4. Inside the `Center` widget, we use a `Column` to arrange three icons vertically.
// 5. Each icon is created using the `Icon` widget, specifying the icon from the `TablerIcons` class, along with its size and color.
// 6. The `main` function runs the `RealFlutter` app, displaying the icons on the screen.
