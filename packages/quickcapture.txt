Setting Up QuickCapture
-----------------------

To use QuickCapture in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. Add the QuickCapture package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  quickcapture: ^1.0.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Import the QuickCapture package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:quickcapture/quickcapture.dart';
```
4. Create a new instance of the `QuickCapture` class:
```dart
QuickCapture _quickCapture = QuickCapture();
```
Platform-Specific Configurations
-------------------------------

### Android

* Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```
* Create a new file called `quickcapture.xml` in your `res/xml` directory:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="quickcapture_authority">com.example.quickcapture</string>
</resources>
```
### iOS

* Add the following permissions to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs camera access to capture images</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs photo library access to save images</string>
```
Using QuickCapture
-----------------

1. Initialize the QuickCapture instance:
```dart
_quickCapture.initialize();
```
2. Capture an image:
```dart
_quickCapture.captureImage();
```
3. Process the captured image:
```dart
_quickCapture.processImage();
```

    _quickCapture.initialize();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('QuickCapture Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                _quickCapture.captureImage();
              },
              child: Text('Capture Image'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                _quickCapture.processImage();
              },
              child: Text('Process Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The app initializes the QuickCapture instance in the initState method.
// 2. The user clicks the "Capture Image" button, which calls the captureImage method.
// 3. The captureImage method captures an image using the device's camera.
// 4. The user clicks the "Process Image" button, which calls the processImage method.
// 5. The processImage method processes the captured image using various filters and effects.
// 6. The processed image is displayed on the screen.

// Final summary:
// The QuickCapture Flutter package provides a simple and efficient way to capture and process images in Flutter applications.
// The package initializes the QuickCapture instance, captures an image, and processes the image using various filters and effects.
// The application flow involves initializing the QuickCapture instance, capturing an image, processing the image, and displaying the processed image on the screen.
