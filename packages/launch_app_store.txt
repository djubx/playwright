```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:launch_app_store/launch_app_store.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Launch App Store Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Launch the App Store when the button is pressed
              LaunchAppStore.launch();
            },
            child: Text('Launch App Store'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user presses the "Launch App Store" button.
// 2. The LaunchAppStore.launch() method is called.
// 3. The method checks the platform (iOS or Android) and launches the corresponding store.
// 4. The App Store or Google Play Store is opened and displays the page for the app.
// 5. The user can then rate, review, or update the app as needed.

// Final summary: This code demonstrates how to use the launch_app_store package to launch the App Store or Google Play Store on mobile devices. The LaunchAppStore class provides a simple way to redirect users to the store for updates, reviews, or purchases.
