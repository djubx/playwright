   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

2. **ProGuard Rules**: If you are using ProGuard, add the following rules to keep the necessary classes:

   ```pro
   -keep class com.example.epubreader.** { *; }
   ```

#### iOS

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_epub_viewer/flutter_epub_viewer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Epub Viewer Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: EpubViewerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class EpubViewerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EpubViewerScreenState createState() => _EpubViewerScreenState();
}

class _EpubViewerScreenState extends State<EpubViewerScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the EPUB viewer when the screen is loaded
    _openEpub();
  }

  Future<void> _openEpub() async {
    // Load an EPUB file from assets or network
    await FlutterEpubViewer.openAsset('assets/sample.epub');
    // Alternatively, use openUrl for network files
    // await FlutterEpubViewer.openUrl('https://example.com/sample.epub');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Epub Viewer'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Epub Viewer is running...'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The application starts by running the `MyApp` class, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// The `EpubViewerScreen` is the main screen where the EPUB viewer is initialized.
// In the `initState` method, `_openEpub` is called to load the EPUB file.
// The `FlutterEpubViewer.openAsset` method is used to open an EPUB file from the assets folder.
// The app displays a simple text indicating that the viewer is running.
