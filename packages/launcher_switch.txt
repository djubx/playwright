# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `launcher_switch`

## Installation
To add the `launcher_switch` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  launcher_switch: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/launcher_switch).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. **Permissions**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions to access the launcher settings. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SET_LAUNCHER" />
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

### iOS
Currently, the `launcher_switch` package is primarily designed for Android. Therefore, no specific iOS configuration is required.

## Using the Package
To use the `launcher_switch` package, you can follow these steps in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:

   ```dart
   import 'package:launcher_switch/launcher_switch.dart';
   ```

2. Create a function to switch launchers:

   ```dart
   void switchLauncher() async {
       // Call the method to switch the launcher
       await LauncherSwitch.switchLauncher();
   }
   ```

3. Call this function based on user interaction, such as a button press.

This setup will allow you to integrate launcher switching functionality into your Flutter application seamlessly.

# Complete Example of Using `launcher_switch`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:launcher_switch/launcher_switch.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Launcher Switch Example',
      home: LauncherSwitchHome(),
    );
  }
}

class LauncherSwitchHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Launcher Switch Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Call the function to switch the launcher when the button is pressed
            switchLauncher();
          },
          child: Text('Switch Launcher'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void switchLauncher() async {
    // Attempt to switch the launcher
    try {
      await LauncherSwitch.switchLauncher();
      // Show a success message if the launcher switch was successful
      print('Launcher switched successfully!');
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the launcher switch
      print('Error switching launcher: $e');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (LauncherSwitchHome).
// 3. LauncherSwitchHome contains a button that, when pressed, calls the switchLauncher function.
// 4. The switchLauncher function attempts to switch the launcher using the LauncherSwitch package.
// 5. If successful, a success message is printed; if an error occurs, it is caught and printed.
