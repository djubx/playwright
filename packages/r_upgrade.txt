# r_upgrade Flutter Package

The `r_upgrade` package is a powerful tool for managing app upgrades in Flutter applications. It provides a seamless way to check for updates, prompt users to upgrade, and handle the upgrade process efficiently. This package is particularly useful for developers who want to ensure that their users are always on the latest version of their app, enhancing user experience and maintaining security.

## When to Use `r_upgrade`

You should consider using the `r_upgrade` package in scenarios such as:
- **Regular App Updates**: If your app frequently receives updates, this package can help notify users and guide them through the upgrade process.
- **Critical Security Patches**: For apps that handle sensitive data, ensuring users are on the latest version is crucial for security.
- **Feature Rollouts**: When introducing new features, you may want to ensure that all users have the latest version to avoid compatibility issues.

## Features

- **Version Checking**: Automatically checks for the latest version of the app.
- **User Notifications**: Prompts users to upgrade with customizable messages.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using r_upgrade

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `r_upgrade` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `r_upgrade` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  r_upgrade: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/r_upgrade).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to allow network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's implement it in our Flutter application.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:r_upgrade/r_upgrade.dart';
```

2. Initialize the package and check for updates. You can do this in your main widget or wherever appropriate in your app:

```dart
void checkForUpdates() async {
  final result = await RUpgrade.checkForUpdate();
  if (result.hasUpdate) {
    RUpgrade.showUpdateDialog();
  }
}
```

3. Call `checkForUpdates()` in your app's initialization logic, such as in the `initState` method of your main widget.

That's it! You now have a basic setup for the `r_upgrade` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of r_upgrade in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:r_upgrade/r_upgrade.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Check for updates when the app starts
    checkForUpdates();
  }

  void checkForUpdates() async {
    // Check if there is an update available
    final result = await RUpgrade.checkForUpdate();
    if (result.hasUpdate) {
      // Show the update dialog if an update is available
      RUpgrade.showUpdateDialog();
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'r_upgrade Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('r_upgrade Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Welcome to the r_upgrade demo!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts and the main widget MyApp is created.
// 2. In the initState method, checkForUpdates() is called to check for any available updates.
// 3. The checkForUpdates() method uses RUpgrade.checkForUpdate() to determine if an update is available.
// 4. If an update is found, RUpgrade.showUpdateDialog() is called to prompt the user to upgrade.
// 5. The main UI displays a simple welcome message while the update check is performed in the background.
```
