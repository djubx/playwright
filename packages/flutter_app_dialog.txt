# Setup and Usage of flutter_app_dialog

## Installation
To use the `flutter_app_dialog` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_app_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` if your dialogs require any specific permissions (like camera access for image upload dialogs).

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_app_dialog` package, you can create a dialog by calling the appropriate method from the `RealFlutter` class. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement an alert dialog:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_app_dialog/flutter_app_dialog.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dialog Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show an alert dialog when the button is pressed
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) {
                  return AppDialog.alert(
                    title: 'Alert',
                    content: 'This is an alert dialog.',
                    onConfirm: () {
                      Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                    },
                  );
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Alert Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, an alert dialog is displayed with a title and content. The dialog can be closed by pressing the confirm button.

# Complete Example of flutter_app_dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_app_dialog/flutter_app_dialog.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dialog Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Show an alert dialog when the button is pressed
              showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) {
                  return AppDialog.alert(
                    title: 'Alert',
                    content: 'This is an alert dialog.',
                    onConfirm: () {
                      Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                    },
                  );
                },
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Alert Dialog'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with RealFlutter.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, the onPressed callback is triggered.
// 5. Inside the callback, showDialog is called to display an alert dialog.
// 6. The dialog is created using AppDialog.alert, which takes a title, content, and an onConfirm callback.
// 7. When the confirm button in the dialog is pressed, Navigator.of(context).pop() is called to close the dialog.
// 8. The user can interact with the dialog, and upon confirmation, it will close, returning to the main screen.
