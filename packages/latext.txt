# Setting Up Latext Package
==========================

To use the Latext package in your Flutter app, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add the Package to Your Pubspec File

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  latext: ^1.0.0
```
### Step 2: Import the Package

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:latext/latext.dart';
```
### Step 3: Use the Latext Widget

Use the `Latext` widget to render your LaTeX equation:
```dart
Latext(
  text: r'\frac{x^2 + y^2}{x + y}',
  fontSize: 24,
  color: Colors.black,
)
```
### Platform-Specific Details

* For Android, make sure to add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<application
  ...
  android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
  ...
>
```
* For iOS, make sure to add the following line to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:latext/latext.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Latext Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Latext Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Render a simple LaTeX equation
              Latext(
                text: r'\frac{x^2 + y^2}{x + y}',
                fontSize: 24,
                color: Colors.black,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Render a more complex LaTeX equation
              Latext(
                text: r'\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx',
                fontSize: 24,
                color: Colors.black,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Render a LaTeX equation with custom font size and color
              Latext(
                text: r'\frac{x^2 + y^2}{x + y}',
                fontSize: 36,
                color: Colors.red,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The application flow is as follows:
// 1. The user runs the app and is presented with a screen containing three LaTeX equations.
// 2. The first equation is a simple fraction, rendered in black with a font size of 24.
// 3. The second equation is a more complex integral, also rendered in black with a font size of 24.
// 4. The third equation is the same as the first, but with a larger font size (36) and rendered in red.
// 5. The user can view the equations and appreciate the power of the Latext package in rendering complex mathematical notation.

// Final summary: This code demonstrates the use of the Latext package in rendering LaTeX equations in a Flutter app. The app presents three equations with different font sizes and colors, showcasing the flexibility and power of the package.
