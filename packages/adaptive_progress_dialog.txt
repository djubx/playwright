Here's a detailed technical blog on the "adaptive_progress_dialog" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Adaptive Progress Dialog Flutter Package

The **adaptive_progress_dialog** package is a versatile and user-friendly solution for displaying progress indicators in Flutter applications. It provides a customizable dialog that adapts to different platforms, ensuring a consistent user experience across iOS and Android. This package is particularly useful when performing long-running tasks, such as network requests or data processing, where users need feedback on the progress of their actions.

## When to Use

You should consider using the **adaptive_progress_dialog** package in scenarios such as:

- **Network Requests**: When fetching data from APIs, showing a progress dialog can inform users that the app is working on their request.
- **File Uploads/Downloads**: For operations that involve uploading or downloading files, a progress dialog can provide real-time feedback.
- **Data Processing**: When performing intensive computations or data manipulations, a progress dialog can keep users informed about the ongoing process.

## Features

- **Adaptive UI**: Automatically adjusts the dialog's appearance based on the platform (iOS or Android).
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to customize the dialog's title, message, and progress indicator.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for showing and dismissing the dialog.
- **Non-blocking**: The dialog does not block the main thread, ensuring a smooth user experience.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Adaptive Progress Dialog

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the **adaptive_progress_dialog** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  adaptive_progress_dialog: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions if you are performing network operations. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow network requests. Add the following lines to your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

To use the **adaptive_progress_dialog** in your application, follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:adaptive_progress_dialog/adaptive_progress_dialog.dart';
```

2. Create a function to show the progress dialog. You can customize the title and message as needed:

```dart
Future<void> showProgressDialog(BuildContext context) async {
  // Show the adaptive progress dialog
  await showAdaptiveProgressDialog(
    context: context,
    title: 'Loading',
    message: 'Please wait while we fetch the data...',
  );
}
```

3. Call this function when you start a long-running task, and dismiss the dialog when the task is complete:

```dart
void fetchData(BuildContext context) async {
  showProgressDialog(context);
  
  // Simulate a network request
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));
  
  // Dismiss the dialog
  Navigator.of(context).pop();
}
```

Now you can integrate this into your app's UI, such as a button that triggers the `fetchData` function.

# Complete Example of Adaptive Progress Dialog

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:adaptive_progress_dialog/adaptive_progress_dialog.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Adaptive Progress Dialog Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Adaptive Progress Dialog'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              fetchData(context); // Trigger the fetchData function on button press
            },
            child: Text('Fetch Data'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to show the progress dialog
  Future<void> showProgressDialog(BuildContext context) async {
    await showAdaptiveProgressDialog(
      context: context,
      title: 'Loading',
      message: 'Please wait while we fetch the data...',
    );
  }

  // Function to simulate data fetching
  void fetchData(BuildContext context) async {
    showProgressDialog(context); // Show the progress dialog
    
    // Simulate a network request with a delay
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));
    
    // Dismiss the dialog after the task is complete
    Navigator.of(context).pop();
    
    // Show a snackbar to indicate completion
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(content: Text('Data fetched successfully!')),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a button in the center.
// 3. When the button is pressed, the fetchData function is called.
// 4. Inside fetchData, the showProgressDialog function is called to display the loading dialog.
// 5. A simulated network request is performed using Future.delayed.
// 6. After the delay, the progress dialog is dismissed, and a snackbar is shown to indicate success.
```
