# Setting Up and Using Flutter Util Code

## Installation
To add the `flutter_util_code` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_util_code: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS
For iOS, ensure that you have the correct permissions set in your `Info.plist` file if you are using any network-related features. For example, if you are making HTTP requests, you might need to add:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use some of the key features of the `flutter_util_code` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_util_code/flutter_util_code.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Util Code Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Example of using string utility
              String formattedString = StringUtil.capitalize("hello world");
              print(formattedString); // Output: Hello world

              // Example of using date utility
              String formattedDate = DateUtil.formatDate(DateTime.now());
              print(formattedDate); // Output: Current date in formatted string
            },
            child: Text('Run Utilities'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we demonstrate how to use string and date utilities from the `flutter_util_code` package. The `StringUtil.capitalize` method capitalizes the first letter of a string, while `DateUtil.formatDate` formats the current date.

# Complete Example of Flutter Util Code

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_util_code/flutter_util_code.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Util Code Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Util Code Example'),
        ),

              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Using StringUtil to capitalize a string
                  String originalString = "flutter is awesome";
                  String capitalizedString = StringUtil.capitalize(originalString);

                              Navigator.of(context).pop();
                            },
                          ),
                        ],
                      );
                    },
                  );
                },

              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  // Using DateUtil to format the current date
                  String formattedDate = DateUtil.formatDate(DateTime.now());
                  // Displaying the formatted date
                  showDialog(
                    context: context,
                    builder: (BuildContext context) {

                        content: Text(formattedDate), // Output: Current date in formatted string
                        actions: <Widget>[
                          TextButton(
                            child: Text("OK"),
                            onPressed: () {
                              Navigator.of(context).pop();
                            },
                          ),
                        ],
                      );
                    },
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Format Current Date'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. Inside the Scaffold, there are two ElevatedButtons:
//    - The first button capitalizes a string using StringUtil and displays it in an AlertDialog.
//    - The second button formats the current date using DateUtil and displays it in another AlertDialog.
// 4. Each button triggers a dialog that shows the result of the utility function when pressed.
