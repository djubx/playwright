// This is the main entry point of the app.
// We create a `RealFlutter` widget and run it as the app.
// The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that displays the device ID, platform, and connection status.
// We use the `getDeviceId`, `getPlatform`, and `isConnected` functions from the `flutter_util_code` package to get the device ID, platform, and connection status.
// We display the results in a column on the screen.
// The app updates the display when the device ID, platform, or connection status changes.

// The app flow is as follows:
// 1. The app starts and creates a `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget initializes its state and gets the device ID, platform, and connection status using the `getDeviceId`, `getPlatform`, and `isConnected` functions.
// 3. The `RealFlutter` widget displays the results in a column on the screen.
// 4. The app updates the display when the device ID, platform, or connection status changes.
