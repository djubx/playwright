// The app's logic flows as follows:
// 1. The app creates a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 2. The home page is a stateful widget that uses the RotationCheck package to detect screen orientation changes.
// 3. When the orientation changes, the app updates the UI to display the current orientation.
// 4. The app also displays a button that can be pressed to handle some action.
// 5. The app's UI is updated based on the current screen orientation.
