# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Scandit Flutter Data Capture Barcode Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `scandit_flutter_datacapture_barcode` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  scandit_flutter_datacapture_barcode: ^X.Y.Z # Replace with the latest version
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the following permissions and metadata to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
    <application>
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.scandit.datacapture.barcode.sdk.appKey"
            android:value="YOUR_APP_KEY"/> <!-- Replace with your Scandit app key -->
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to request camera permissions:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to the camera for barcode scanning.</string>
```

2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed and run `pod install` in the `ios` directory.

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that the package is set up, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement barcode scanning.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
# Complete Example: Implementing Barcode Scanning

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:scandit_flutter_datacapture_barcode/scandit_flutter_datacapture_barcode.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Declare a DataCaptureContext and BarcodeCapture
  DataCaptureContext? _dataCaptureContext;
  BarcodeCapture? _barcodeCapture;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Scandit SDK
    _initializeScandit();
  }

  Future<void> _initializeScandit() async {
    // Create a DataCaptureContext with your Scandit app key
    _dataCaptureContext = DataCaptureContext.forLicenseKey("YOUR_APP_KEY"); // Replace with your Scandit app key

    // Create BarcodeCapture settings
    final barcodeCaptureSettings = BarcodeCaptureSettings();
    barcodeCaptureSettings.enableSymbologies([Symbology.ean13, Symbology.qr]);

    // Create BarcodeCapture with the context and settings
    _barcodeCapture = BarcodeCapture.forContext(_dataCaptureContext!, barcodeCaptureSettings);

    // Set the listener for barcode capture
    _barcodeCapture!.addListener(_onBarcodeScanned);
  }

  void _onBarcodeScanned(BarcodeCapture barcodeCapture, BarcodeCaptureSession session, Error? error) {
    // Handle the scanned barcode
    if (session.newlyRecognizedBarcodes.isNotEmpty) {
      final barcode = session.newlyRecognizedBarcodes.first;
      // Show the scanned barcode in a dialog
      showDialog(
        context: context,
        builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
          title: Text("Scanned Barcode"),
          content: Text(barcode.data),
          actions: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
              child: Text("OK"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Barcode Scanner")),
        body: Center(
          child: Text("Scan a barcode"),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Dispose of the DataCaptureContext and BarcodeCapture
    _dataCaptureContext?.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts by initializing the Scandit SDK in the `initState` method.
// A `DataCaptureContext` is created using the provided Scandit app key.
// The `BarcodeCapture` is set up with specific barcode symbologies (EAN13 and QR).
// A listener is added to handle scanned barcodes.
// When a barcode is scanned, the `_onBarcodeScanned` method is triggered.
// This method checks if any new barcodes were recognized and displays the first one in a dialog.
// The main UI consists of a simple text prompt to scan a barcode.
// Finally, resources are cleaned up in the `dispose` method to prevent memory leaks.
