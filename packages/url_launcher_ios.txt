# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `url_launcher_ios`

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `url_launcher` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Note that `url_launcher_ios` is part of the `url_launcher` package, so you only need to include that.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  url_launcher: ^6.0.20  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration
For iOS, you need to ensure that your app has the appropriate permissions to launch URLs. Open your `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following entries:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>http</string>
    <string>https</string>
    <string>tel</string>
    <string>sms</string>
    <string>mailto</string>
</array>
```

### Android Configuration
For Android, you typically do not need to make any special configurations. However, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the following permissions if you plan to make phone calls or send SMS:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CALL_PHONE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS"/>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to launch a URL:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('URL Launcher Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              const url = 'https://flutter.dev';
              if (await canLaunch(url)) {
                await launch(url);
              } else {
                throw 'Could not launch $url';
              }
            },
            child: Text('Open Flutter Website'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() => runApp(RealFlutter());
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, it checks if the URL can be launched and then opens it in the default browser.

# Complete Example of `url_launcher_ios`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';

// Main class of the application
class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('URL Launcher Example')),

            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Button to open a website
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  const url = 'https://flutter.dev'; // URL to be launched
                  // Check if the URL can be launched
                  if (await canLaunch(url)) {
                    await launch(url); // Launch the URL
                  } else {
                    throw 'Could not launch $url'; // Error handling
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Open Flutter Website'),
              ),
              // Button to make a phone call
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  const phoneNumber = 'tel:+1234567890'; // Phone number to call
                  // Check if the phone number can be dialed
                  if (await canLaunch(phoneNumber)) {
                    await launch(phoneNumber); // Launch the phone dialer
                  } else {
                    throw 'Could not dial $phoneNumber'; // Error handling
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Call +1234567890'),
              ),
              // Button to send an email
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  const email = 'mailto:test@example.com?subject=Hello&body=Hi'; // Email details
                  // Check if the email can be sent
                  if (await canLaunch(email)) {
                    await launch(email); // Launch the email client
                  } else {
                    throw 'Could not send email'; // Error handling
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Send Email'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Entry point of the application
void main() => runApp(RealFlutter());
```

### Application Flow Explanation
// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `RealFlutter` widget.
// The `RealFlutter` widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Center widget.
// Inside the Center widget, there are three buttons:
// 1. The first button opens the Flutter website when pressed. It checks if the URL can be launched and then uses the `launch` method to open it.
// 2. The second button initiates a phone call to the specified number. It also checks if the phone number can be dialed before launching the phone dialer.
// 3. The third button opens the email client with pre-filled subject and body. It checks if the email can be sent before launching the email client.
// Each button has error handling to throw an exception if the action cannot be completed, ensuring a smooth user experience.
