# Tutorial: Setting Up Just Audio Web

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **just_audio_web** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter web application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **just_audio_web** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  just_audio: ^0.9.18
  just_audio_web: ^0.9.18
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependencies.

## Step 2: Configure for Web

The **just_audio_web** package requires no additional configuration for web applications. However, ensure that your Flutter environment is set up for web development. You can check this by running:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

Make sure you have the web development environment ready.

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now, letâ€™s create a simple audio player using the **just_audio_web** package. Below is a basic example of how to implement audio playback in your Flutter web application.

1. Import the necessary packages in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:just_audio/just_audio.dart';
```

2. Create a new class called `RealFlutter` that extends `StatefulWidget`:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}
```

3. In the state class, initialize the audio player and load an audio source:

```dart
class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late AudioPlayer _audioPlayer;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _audioPlayer = AudioPlayer();
    _loadAudio();
  }

  Future<void> _loadAudio() async {
    try {
      await _audioPlayer.setUrl('https://www.example.com/audio.mp3'); // Replace with your audio URL
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error loading audio: $e");
    }
  }
}
```

4. Add UI elements to control playback:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Just Audio Web Example')),
    body: Center(
      child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () => _audioPlayer.play(),
            child: Text('Play'),
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () => _audioPlayer.pause(),
            child: Text('Pause'),
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () => _audioPlayer.stop(),
            child: Text('Stop'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

5. Finally, dispose of the audio player when the widget is removed from the tree:

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  _audioPlayer.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
```

Now you have a basic audio player set up using the **just_audio_web** package!

# Complete Example of Just Audio Web

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:just_audio/just_audio.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Just Audio Web Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  late AudioPlayer _audioPlayer; // Declare the audio player

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _audioPlayer = AudioPlayer(); // Initialize the audio player
    _loadAudio(); // Load the audio source
  }

  // Load the audio from a URL
  Future<void> _loadAudio() async {
    try {
      await _audioPlayer.setUrl('https://www.example.com/audio.mp3'); // Replace with your audio URL
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error loading audio: $e"); // Handle any errors during loading
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Just Audio Web Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _audioPlayer.play(), // Play audio
              child: Text('Play'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _audioPlayer.pause(), // Pause audio
              child: Text('Pause'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () => _audioPlayer.stop(), // Stop audio
              child: Text('Stop'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _audioPlayer.dispose(); // Dispose of the audio player
    super.dispose();
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as RealFlutter.
// 3. In RealFlutter, the audio player is initialized in initState, and an audio URL is loaded.
// 4. The UI consists of three buttons: Play, Pause, and Stop, which control the audio playback.
// 5. When the widget is disposed, the audio player is also disposed to free up resources.
```
