# flutter_traceroute Package Overview

The `flutter_traceroute` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows you to perform network traceroute operations directly from your Flutter applications. This package is particularly useful for applications that require network diagnostics, such as network monitoring tools, performance analysis apps, or any application that needs to visualize the path data takes to reach a specific server.

## When to Use This Package
- **Network Diagnostics**: If you need to analyze the route packets take to a destination, this package is ideal.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Use it to monitor network performance and latency.
- **Educational Tools**: Great for apps that teach networking concepts.

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS.
- **Real-Time Results**: Provides real-time traceroute results.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of traceroute parameters such as timeout and maximum hops.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates seamlessly with Flutter applications.

Overall, `flutter_traceroute` is a valuable package for developers looking to enhance their applications with network tracing capabilities.

# flutter_traceroute Setup and Usage Tutorial

## Installation
To add the `flutter_traceroute` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_traceroute: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_traceroute).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:
   ```groovy
   android {
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
           minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   ```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following permissions:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   ```

## Basic Usage
To use the `flutter_traceroute` package, you can create an instance of the `RealFlutter` class and call its methods to perform a traceroute. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_traceroute/flutter_traceroute.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _result = '';

  void _startTraceroute() async {
    // Start the traceroute to a specific host
    final traceroute = FlutterTraceroute();
    final results = await traceroute.trace('google.com');
    
    // Update the result state with the traceroute output
    setState(() {
      _result = results.join('\n');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Traceroute Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startTraceroute,
              child: Text('Start Traceroute'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_result),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, a traceroute to `google.com` is initiated, and the results are displayed on the screen.

# Complete Example of flutter_traceroute

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_traceroute/flutter_traceroute.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Traceroute Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _result = ''; // Variable to hold traceroute results

  void _startTraceroute() async {
    // Create an instance of FlutterTraceroute
    final traceroute = FlutterTraceroute();
    
    // Start the traceroute to a specific host
    final results = await traceroute.trace('google.com');
    
    // Update the result state with the traceroute output
    setState(() {
      _result = results.join('\n'); // Join results into a single string
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Traceroute Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _startTraceroute, // Trigger traceroute on button press
              child: Text('Start Traceroute'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(_result), // Display the traceroute results
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.
// 2. The home of the app is set to RealFlutter, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 3. When the user presses the "Start Traceroute" button, the _startTraceroute method is called.
// 4. This method creates an instance of FlutterTraceroute and calls the trace method with 'google.com'.
// 5. The results of the traceroute are awaited and then displayed in the Text widget.
// 6. The UI updates to show the traceroute results in real-time.
