# Tutorial: Setting Up Pull Request Coverage

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **pull_request_coverage** package and explain how to use it effectively in your Flutter projects.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the **pull_request_coverage** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  pull_request_coverage: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/pull_request_coverage).

## Step 2: Configure Your CI/CD Pipeline

### For GitHub Actions

1. Create a new workflow file in your repository under `.github/workflows/coverage.yml`.
2. Add the following configuration:

```yaml
name: Pull Request Coverage

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Flutter
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: 'latest'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: flutter pub get

      - name: Run tests with coverage
        run: flutter test --coverage

      - name: Generate coverage report
        run: pull_request_coverage --path coverage/lcov.info
```

### For Travis CI

1. Create or update your `.travis.yml` file with the following:

```yaml
language: dart
dart:
  - stable

script:
  - flutter test --coverage
  - pull_request_coverage --path coverage/lcov.info
```

### For CircleCI

1. Update your `.circleci/config.yml` file:

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  test:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/flutter:latest
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: flutter pub get
      - run: flutter test --coverage
      - run: pull_request_coverage --path coverage/lcov.info

workflows:
  version: 2
  test:
    jobs:
      - test
```

## Step 3: Run Your Tests

After setting up your CI/CD pipeline, you can run your tests. The **pull_request_coverage** package will automatically generate coverage reports and post them as comments on your pull requests.

## Step 4: Customize Coverage Thresholds

You can customize the coverage thresholds by adding a configuration file named `.pull_request_coverage.yaml` in the root of your project:

```yaml
coverage:
  min_coverage: 80
  report_format: lcov
```

This configuration ensures that your code coverage remains above 80% before merging any pull requests.

With these steps, you have successfully set up the **pull_request_coverage** package in your Flutter project!

# Complete Example: Using Pull Request Coverage

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:pull_request_coverage/pull_request_coverage.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Pull Request Coverage Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CoverageHome(),
    );
  }
}

class CoverageHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pull Request Coverage Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // This button simulates a test run and coverage report generation
            generateCoverageReport();
          },
          child: Text('Run Tests and Generate Coverage'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void generateCoverageReport() {
    // Simulate running tests and generating a coverage report
    // In a real application, this would trigger the test suite
    print('Running tests...');
    // Here you would call the pull_request_coverage functionality
    // For example: PullRequestCoverage.generate();
    print('Coverage report generated!');
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp, setting the title and theme.
// 3. The home property of the MaterialApp is set to CoverageHome, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 4. In the CoverageHome widget, an AppBar is created with the title "Pull Request Coverage Example".
// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 6. When the button is pressed, the generateCoverageReport function is called.
// 7. The generateCoverageReport function simulates running tests and generating a coverage report.
// 8. In a real implementation, this function would invoke the pull_request_coverage package to generate the actual coverage report.
