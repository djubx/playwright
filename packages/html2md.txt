<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Overview of the html2md Flutter Package

The `html2md` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for the conversion of HTML content into Markdown format. This is particularly useful when dealing with content management systems (CMS) or web services that provide data in HTML format, and you want to display it in a more readable Markdown format within your Flutter applications.

## When to Use html2md

- **Content Management**: If your application fetches content from a CMS that outputs HTML, you can use `html2md` to convert that content into Markdown for easier rendering.
- **User-Generated Content**: When users input HTML content (e.g., from a rich text editor), you can convert it to Markdown for storage or display.
- **Data Interoperability**: If your app interacts with APIs that return HTML, converting it to Markdown can simplify data handling and presentation.

## Features

- **Simple API**: The package provides a straightforward API for converting HTML to Markdown.
- **Customizable**: You can extend or modify the conversion process to suit your specific needs.
- **Lightweight**: The package is designed to be lightweight, ensuring minimal impact on your app's performance.

## Example Use Cases

1. **Blog Applications**: Convert HTML blog posts into Markdown for display.
2. **Documentation Apps**: Render HTML documentation in a Markdown format for better readability.
3. **Chat Applications**: Allow users to send formatted messages in HTML and convert them to Markdown for display.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using html2md

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `html2md` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  html2md: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the `html2md` package:

```dart
import 'package:html2md/html2md.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the `html2md` package to convert HTML to Markdown. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
String htmlContent = "<h1>Hello World</h1><p>This is a paragraph.</p>";
String markdownContent = Html2md.convert(htmlContent);
print(markdownContent); // Outputs: # Hello World\n\nThis is a paragraph.
```

This will convert the HTML string into Markdown format, which you can then use in your Flutter widgets.

# Complete Example of Using html2md in a Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:html2md/html2md.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'html2md Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('html2md Example'),
        ),
        body: HtmlToMarkdownWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class HtmlToMarkdownWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Sample HTML content to convert
    String htmlContent = "<h1>Hello World</h1><p>This is a paragraph.</p>";
    
    // Convert HTML to Markdown
    String markdownContent = Html2md.convert(htmlContent);
    
    // Display the converted Markdown content
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Text(
        markdownContent,
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a body that displays the HtmlToMarkdownWidget.
// 4. HtmlToMarkdownWidget is another StatelessWidget that converts HTML content to Markdown.
// 5. The HTML content is defined as a string, which is then converted to Markdown using Html2md.convert().
// 6. Finally, the converted Markdown is displayed in a Text widget with some padding for better readability.
