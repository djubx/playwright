# flutter_critical_alert_permission_ios: A Comprehensive Overview

The `flutter_critical_alert_permission_ios` package is designed to help Flutter developers manage critical alert permissions on iOS devices. This package is particularly useful for applications that need to send urgent notifications to users, even when the device is in Do Not Disturb mode. 

## When to Use This Package
You should consider using this package if your application requires:
- Sending critical alerts that must be delivered regardless of the user's notification settings.
- Compliance with iOS guidelines for critical alerts, ensuring that your app can effectively communicate important information to users.

## Key Features
- **Request Critical Alert Permission**: Easily request permission from users to send critical alerts.
- **Check Permission Status**: Determine whether the app has been granted permission to send critical alerts.
- **Handle Permission Changes**: Listen for changes in permission status and respond accordingly.

This package is essential for apps in sectors like healthcare, emergency services, or any application where timely notifications are crucial.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_critical_alert_permission_ios

## Installation
To add the `flutter_critical_alert_permission_ios` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_critical_alert_permission_ios: ^latest_version
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## iOS Configuration
Since this package is specific to iOS, you need to make some configurations in your iOS project:

1. Open the `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner/`.
2. Add the following key to request critical alert permissions:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
</array>
<key>NSUserNotificationUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires permission to send critical alerts.</string>
<key>NSUserCriticalAlertUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs to send critical alerts that can bypass Do Not Disturb.</string>
```

## Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_critical_alert_permission_ios/flutter_critical_alert_permission_ios.dart';
```

2. Request permission and check the status:

```dart
void checkCriticalAlertPermission() async {
  // Request permission for critical alerts
  final permissionStatus = await FlutterCriticalAlertPermission.requestPermission();

  // Check the permission status
  if (permissionStatus == CriticalAlertPermissionStatus.granted) {
    print("Critical alert permission granted.");
  } else {
    print("Critical alert permission denied.");
  }
}
```

3. You can also listen for permission changes:

```dart
void listenForPermissionChanges() {
  FlutterCriticalAlertPermission.onPermissionChanged.listen((status) {
    if (status == CriticalAlertPermissionStatus.granted) {
      print("Critical alert permission granted.");
    } else {
      print("Critical alert permission denied.");
    }
  });
}
```

This setup allows you to effectively manage critical alert permissions in your Flutter app.

# Complete Example of Using flutter_critical_alert_permission_ios

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_critical_alert_permission_ios/flutter_critical_alert_permission_ios.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Critical Alert Permission Demo',
      home: CriticalAlertHome(),
    );
  }
}

class CriticalAlertHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CriticalAlertHomeState createState() => _CriticalAlertHomeState();
}

class _CriticalAlertHomeState extends State<CriticalAlertHome> {
  String _permissionStatus = "Unknown";

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    checkCriticalAlertPermission(); // Check permission on app start
    listenForPermissionChanges(); // Listen for permission changes
  }

  // Function to check critical alert permission
  void checkCriticalAlertPermission() async {
    final permissionStatus = await FlutterCriticalAlertPermission.requestPermission();
    setState(() {
      _permissionStatus = permissionStatus == CriticalAlertPermissionStatus.granted
          ? "Granted"
          : "Denied";
    });
  }

  // Function to listen for permission changes
  void listenForPermissionChanges() {
    FlutterCriticalAlertPermission.onPermissionChanged.listen((status) {
      setState(() {
        _permissionStatus = status == CriticalAlertPermissionStatus.granted
            ? "Granted"
            : "Denied";
      });
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Critical Alert Permission'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Critical Alert Permission Status: $_permissionStatus'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a home screen of CriticalAlertHome.
// 3. In the CriticalAlertHome state, we check for critical alert permissions when the widget initializes.
// 4. The permission status is updated based on the user's response and displayed on the screen.
// 5. The app also listens for any changes in permission status and updates the UI accordingly.
