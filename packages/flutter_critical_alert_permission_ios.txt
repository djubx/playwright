// The code flow is straightforward, with the app requesting permission and then displaying the critical alert when the button is pressed.
// The critical alert is displayed using the `showAlert` method, which takes in a title and message as parameters.
// The app uses the `MaterialApp` and `Scaffold` widgets to provide a basic UI, with a button to trigger the critical alert.
// Overall, the code is simple and easy to understand, making it a great example of how to use the `flutter_critical_alert_permission_ios` package.
