# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the `iabtcf_consent_info` Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the `iabtcf_consent_info` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  iabtcf_consent_info: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/iabtcf_consent_info).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS Configuration

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to request permission for tracking:

```xml
<key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires tracking permission to provide personalized ads.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to initialize and use the `iabtcf_consent_info` package.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:iabtcf_consent_info/iabtcf_consent_info.dart';
```

2. Initialize the consent information:

```dart
final consentInfo = IABTCFConsentInfo();
```

3. Request user consent and handle the response:

```dart
void requestConsent() async {
  final result = await consentInfo.requestConsent();
  if (result.isGranted) {
    // User granted consent
  } else {
    // User denied consent
  }
}
```

This basic setup allows you to manage user consent effectively. You can expand upon this by integrating it with your app's data collection and advertising logic.

# Complete Example of Using the `iabtcf_consent_info` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iabtcf_consent_info/iabtcf_consent_info.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Consent Management App',
      home: ConsentScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ConsentScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ConsentScreenState createState() => _ConsentScreenState();
}

class _ConsentScreenState extends State<ConsentScreen> {
  final consentInfo = IABTCFConsentInfo();
  bool? isConsentGranted;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Request user consent when the app starts
    requestConsent();
  }

  void requestConsent() async {
    // Request consent from the user
    final result = await consentInfo.requestConsent();
    setState(() {
      isConsentGranted = result.isGranted; // Update the state based on consent
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Consent Management'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: isConsentGranted == null
            ? CircularProgressIndicator() // Show loading indicator while waiting for consent
            : Text(
                isConsentGranted! ? 'Consent Granted' : 'Consent Denied',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the main function runs, initializing the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds the MaterialApp and sets the home to ConsentScreen.
// 3. In the ConsentScreen, the initState method is called, which triggers the requestConsent method.
// 4. The requestConsent method calls the requestConsent function from the iabtcf_consent_info package.
// 5. Based on the user's response, the state is updated to reflect whether consent was granted or denied.
// 6. The UI displays either a loading indicator or the consent status message to the user.
