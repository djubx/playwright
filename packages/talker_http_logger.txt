# Tutorial

## Setup Process

To get started with the `talker_http_logger` package, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package under dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     talker_http_logger: ^latest_version
   ```

   Replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/talker_http_logger).

2. **Install Packages**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:
   - **Android**: Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for internet access. Add the following line inside the `<manifest>` tag:

     ```xml
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
     ```

   - **iOS**: For iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` file to allow arbitrary loads if you are testing with non-HTTPS endpoints. Add the following:

     ```xml
     <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
     <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <true/>
     </dict>
     ```

## Using the Package

To use the `talker_http_logger` package in your Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Package**:

   ```dart
   import 'package:talker_http_logger/talker_http_logger.dart';
   ```

2. **Initialize the Logger**: Create an instance of the logger in your main application file.

   ```dart
   final logger = TalkerHttpLogger();
   ```

3. **Wrap Your Application**: Use the logger in your application by wrapping your `MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp` with the logger.

   ```dart
   void main() {
     runApp(MyApp());
   }

   class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return TalkerHttpLoggerProvider(
         logger: logger,
         child: MaterialApp(
           title: 'HTTP Logger Demo',
           home: HomeScreen(),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Log HTTP Requests**: You can now log HTTP requests by using the logger instance. For example, when making a network call using `http` package:

   ```dart
   final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/data'));
   logger.logRequest(response.request);
   logger.logResponse(response);
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively set up and use the `talker_http_logger` package in your Flutter application.

# Complete Example

Hereâ€™s a complete example of a Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the `talker_http_logger` package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'package:talker_http_logger/talker_http_logger.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

// Main application widget
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an instance of the TalkerHttpLogger
    final logger = TalkerHttpLogger();

    // Wrap the MaterialApp with TalkerHttpLoggerProvider
    return TalkerHttpLoggerProvider(
      logger: logger,
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'HTTP Logger Demo',
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Home screen widget
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('HTTP Logger Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Call the function to fetch data when the button is pressed
            fetchData(context);
          },
          child: Text('Fetch Data'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to fetch data from an API
  Future<void> fetchData(BuildContext context) async {
    // Get the logger instance from the provider
    final logger = TalkerHttpLoggerProvider.of(context).logger;

    // Make an HTTP GET request
    final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/data'));

    // Log the request and response
    logger.logRequest(response.request);
    logger.logResponse(response);

    // Show a dialog with the response status
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
        title: Text('Response Status'),
        content: Text('Status Code: ${response.statusCode}'),
        actions: [
          TextButton(
            onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
            child: Text('OK'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Application Flow Explanation

// The application starts with the `main` function, which runs the `MyApp` widget.
// Inside `MyApp`, we create an instance of `TalkerHttpLogger` and wrap the `MaterialApp`
// with `TalkerHttpLoggerProvider`, allowing us to access the logger throughout the app.
// The `HomeScreen` widget displays a button that, when pressed, triggers the `fetchData` function.
// This function makes an HTTP GET request to a specified API endpoint.
// After the request is made, we log the request and response using the logger instance.
// Finally, we display an alert dialog showing the HTTP response status code to the user.
// This flow allows us to monitor and debug HTTP requests effectively using the logger.
