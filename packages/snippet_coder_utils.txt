# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Snippet Coder Utils

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `snippet_coder_utils` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  snippet_coder_utils: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configurations

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest Flutter versions. Make sure to set the platform version:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package to start using its features:

```dart
import 'package:snippet_coder_utils/snippet_coder_utils.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Package

You can now use the various utilities provided by the package. For example, to validate an email address:

```dart
bool isValidEmail = EmailValidator.validate("example@example.com");
```

This will return `true` if the email is valid, and `false` otherwise.

By following these steps, you can easily integrate the `snippet_coder_utils` package into your Flutter application and start utilizing its powerful features.

# Complete Example of Using Snippet Coder Utils

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:snippet_coder_utils/snippet_coder_utils.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Snippet Coder Utils Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Snippet Coder Utils Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: EmailValidationForm(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class EmailValidationForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EmailValidationFormState createState() => _EmailValidationFormState();
}

class _EmailValidationFormState extends State<EmailValidationForm> {
  final TextEditingController _emailController = TextEditingController();
  String _validationMessage = '';

  void _validateEmail() {
    // Get the email input from the controller
    String email = _emailController.text;

    // Validate the email using the EmailValidator from the package
    if (EmailValidator.validate(email)) {
      setState(() {
        _validationMessage = 'Valid Email!';
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _validationMessage = 'Invalid Email!';
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        TextField(
          controller: _emailController,
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            labelText: 'Enter your email',
          ),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _validateEmail,
          child: Text('Validate Email'),
        ),
        SizedBox(height: 20),
        Text(
          _validationMessage,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.red),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by running the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a centered EmailValidationForm widget.
// 4. The EmailValidationForm widget maintains a TextEditingController to capture user input.
// 5. When the user enters an email and presses the "Validate Email" button, the _validateEmail method is called.
// 6. This method retrieves the email from the controller and uses the EmailValidator to check its validity.
// 7. Based on the validation result, it updates the _validationMessage state, which is displayed below the button.
