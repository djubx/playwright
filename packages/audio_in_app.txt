# Setting Up and Using the audio_in_app Package

## Installation
To get started with the `audio_in_app` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  audio_in_app: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/audio_in_app).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for audio recording:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to record audio.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to save recordings.</string>
```

## Basic Usage
Once you have installed the package and configured the necessary permissions, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement audio recording and playback.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:audio_in_app/audio_in_app.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  AudioInApp audioInApp = AudioInApp();
  bool isRecording = false;

  void startRecording() async {
    await audioInApp.startRecording();
    setState(() {
      isRecording = true;
    });
  }

  void stopRecording() async {
    await audioInApp.stopRecording();
    setState(() {
      isRecording = false;
    });
  }

  void playRecording() async {
    await audioInApp.playRecording();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Audio In App Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: isRecording ? stopRecording : startRecording,
              child: Text(isRecording ? 'Stop Recording' : 'Start Recording'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: playRecording,
              child: Text('Play Recording'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Complete Example of audio_in_app

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:audio_in_app/audio_in_app.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Create an instance of the AudioInApp class
  AudioInApp audioInApp = AudioInApp();
  bool isRecording = false; // Track recording state

  // Function to start recording audio
  void startRecording() async {
    await audioInApp.startRecording(); // Start recording
    setState(() {
      isRecording = true; // Update state to indicate recording
    });
  }

  // Function to stop recording audio
  void stopRecording() async {
    await audioInApp.stopRecording(); // Stop recording
    setState(() {
      isRecording = false; // Update state to indicate recording has stopped
    });
  }

  // Function to play the recorded audio
  void playRecording() async {
    await audioInApp.playRecording(); // Play the recorded audio
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Audio In App Example')), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Button to start/stop recording
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: isRecording ? stopRecording : startRecording,
              child: Text(isRecording ? 'Stop Recording' : 'Start Recording'),
            ),
            // Button to play the recorded audio
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: playRecording,
              child: Text('Play Recording'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter widget, which is a StatefulWidget.
// 2. The _RealFlutterState class manages the audio recording state.
// 3. The startRecording function is called when the user presses the "Start Recording" button.
// 4. The stopRecording function is called when the user presses the "Stop Recording" button.
// 5. The playRecording function plays the recorded audio when the "Play Recording" button is pressed.
// 6. The UI updates based on the recording state, providing feedback to the user.
