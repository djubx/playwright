## Basic Usage

To use FlashcardPlus in your application, you need to import the package and create a simple flashcard interface. Below is a basic example of how to set it up.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flashcardplus/flashcardplus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'FlashcardPlus Example',
      home: FlashcardScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FlashcardScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('FlashcardPlus')),
      body: FlashcardPlus(
        flashcards: [
          Flashcard(question: 'What is Flutter?', answer: 'A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications.'),
          Flashcard(question: 'What is Dart?', answer: 'The programming language used by Flutter.'),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic flashcard application using the FlashcardPlus package. You can customize the flashcards by adding more questions and answers as needed.

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'FlashcardPlus Example',
      home: FlashcardScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FlashcardScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('FlashcardPlus')),
      body: FlashcardPlus(
        flashcards: [
          Flashcard(question: 'What is Flutter?', answer: 'A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications.'),
          Flashcard(question: 'What is Dart?', answer: 'The programming language used by Flutter.'),
          Flashcard(question: 'What is a StatefulWidget?', answer: 'A widget that can change its state during its lifetime.'),
          Flashcard(question: 'What is a StatelessWidget?', answer: 'A widget that does not require mutable state.'),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The home screen is FlashcardScreen, which contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold uses FlashcardPlus to display a list of flashcards.
// 5. Each flashcard consists of a question and an answer, which users can flip through.
// 6. The FlashcardPlus package handles the display and interaction of the flashcards, providing a smooth user experience.
