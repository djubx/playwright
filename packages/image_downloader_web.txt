# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Image Downloader Web Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `image_downloader_web` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_downloader_web: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/image_downloader_web).

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:image_downloader_web/image_downloader_web.dart';
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### For Web

No additional configuration is required for web applications. The package is designed to work seamlessly in the web environment.

### For Android and iOS

While this package is primarily for web, if you plan to use similar functionality in mobile applications, consider using the `image_downloader` package, which requires additional permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml for Android and Info.plist for iOS.

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the package to download images. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the image downloading functionality:

```dart
void downloadImage(String imageUrl) async {
  try {
    // Initiate the download process
    var response = await ImageDownloader.downloadImage(imageUrl);
    // Check if the download was successful
    if (response != null) {
      print('Image downloaded successfully: $response');
    } else {
      print('Failed to download image.');
    }
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error downloading image: $e');
  }
}
```

This function takes an image URL as input and attempts to download it. If successful, it prints the response; otherwise, it logs an error.

## Conclusion

With these steps, you can easily integrate the `image_downloader_web` package into your Flutter web application. The package's straightforward API and cross-platform capabilities make it an excellent choice for developers looking to add image downloading features to their apps.

# Complete Example: Flutter Main File

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_downloader_web/image_downloader_web.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Downloader Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Image Downloader Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // URL of the image to be downloaded
              String imageUrl = 'https://example.com/image.jpg';
              downloadImage(imageUrl);
            },
            child: Text('Download Image'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Function to download the image
  void downloadImage(String imageUrl) async {
    try {
      // Initiate the download process
      var response = await ImageDownloader.downloadImage(imageUrl);
      // Check if the download was successful
      if (response != null) {
        print('Image downloaded successfully: $response');
      } else {
        print('Failed to download image.');
      }
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error downloading image: $e');
    }
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget with an ElevatedButton.
// 4. When the button is pressed, it triggers the downloadImage function with a specified image URL.
// 5. The downloadImage function attempts to download the image using the ImageDownloader package.
// 6. If the download is successful, it prints the response; otherwise, it logs an error message.
