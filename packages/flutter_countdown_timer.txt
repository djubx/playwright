# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using flutter_countdown_timer

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `flutter_countdown_timer` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_countdown_timer: ^6.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement a countdown timer.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_countdown_timer/flutter_countdown_timer.dart';
```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the countdown timer:

```dart
class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  int endTime = DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch + 1000 * 30; // 30 seconds countdown

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Countdown Timer Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: CountdownTimer(
          endTime: endTime,
          onEnd: () {
            // Timer finished
            print('Countdown Ended');
          },
          widgetBuilder: (_, time) {
            if (time == null) {
              return Text('Time is up!', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24));
            }
            return Text(
              '${time.hours}:${time.min}:${time.sec}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple countdown timer that counts down from 30 seconds and displays the remaining time in hours, minutes, and seconds.

# Complete Example of flutter_countdown_timer

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_countdown_timer/flutter_countdown_timer.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Countdown Timer Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Set the end time for the countdown (30 seconds from now)
  int endTime = DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch + 1000 * 30;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Countdown Timer Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: CountdownTimer(
          endTime: endTime, // Set the end time for the countdown
          onEnd: () {
            // This callback is triggered when the countdown ends
            print('Countdown Ended');
          },
          widgetBuilder: (_, time) {
            // This builder is called every time the timer ticks
            if (time == null) {
              // If the time is null, the countdown has ended
              return Text('Time is up!', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24));
            }
            // Display the remaining time in hours, minutes, and seconds
            return Text(
              '${time.hours}:${time.min}:${time.sec}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 48),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp and defines the home as RealFlutter.
// 3. RealFlutter is a stateful widget that initializes a countdown timer for 30 seconds.
// 4. The CountdownTimer widget is built in the center of the screen.
// 5. The timer counts down and updates the displayed time every second.
// 6. When the countdown reaches zero, the onEnd callback is triggered, and a message is printed to the console.
