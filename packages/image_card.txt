# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Image Card Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started with the `image_card` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and include the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_card: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:image_card/image_card.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using the Image Card Widget

You can now use the `ImageCard` widget in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it:

```dart
ImageCard(
  imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
  title: 'Sample Image',
  description: 'This is a description of the sample image.',
  onTap: () {
    // Handle tap event
  },
);
```

This widget will display an image with a title and description, and it will respond to tap events.

With these steps, you are now ready to use the `image_card` package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Using the Image Card Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_card/image_card.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Card Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Image Card Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              // Using the ImageCard widget to display an image
              ImageCard(
                imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg', // URL of the image
                title: 'Sample Image', // Title of the image
                description: 'This is a description of the sample image.', // Description text
                onTap: () {
                  // Action to perform when the card is tapped
                  print('Image Card Tapped!');
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds the MaterialApp.
// 3. The MaterialApp contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange the ImageCard vertically.
// 5. The ImageCard widget displays an image from the provided URL, along with a title and description.
// 6. When the ImageCard is tapped, it triggers the onTap callback, which currently prints a message to the console.
