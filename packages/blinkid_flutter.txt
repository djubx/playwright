void main() {

}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: RealFlutter(),
    );
  }
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _scanResult = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    BlinkIdFlutter.instance.initialize();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Blink ID Flutter Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _scanDocument,
              child: Text('Scan Document'),
            ),
            Text(_scanResult),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Future<void> _scanDocument() async {
    // Start the scanning process
    BlinkIdFlutter.instance.scanDocument().then((result) {
      // Get the scan result
      setState(() {
        _scanResult = result;
      });
    });
  }
}

// Application flow:
// 1. The user clicks the "Scan Document" button.
// 2. The _scanDocument function is called, which starts the scanning process.
// 3. The BlinkIdFlutter instance scans the document and recognizes the data.
// 4. The scan result is returned and displayed on the screen.
// 5. The user can view the scan result and take further actions if needed.

// Summary:
// This code demonstrates how to use the Blink ID Flutter package to scan documents and recognize data.
// The application flow is straightforward, and the user can easily scan documents and view the results.
