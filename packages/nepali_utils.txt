# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Nepali Utils

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **nepali_utils** package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the **nepali_utils** package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  nepali_utils: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the correct configurations. You may need to set the minimum SDK version to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, make sure to update your `ios/Podfile` to support the latest iOS versions. You can set the platform version as follows:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to utilize the features of **nepali_utils**.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:nepali_utils/nepali_utils.dart';
```

2. Use the utility functions provided by the package. For example, you can format a date and convert a number to Nepali numerals:

```dart
void main() {
  // Example of formatting a date
  String nepaliDate = NepaliUtils.formatNepaliDate(DateTime.now());
  print('Nepali Date: $nepaliDate');

  // Example of converting a number to Nepali numerals
  String nepaliNumber = NepaliUtils.convertToNepaliNumerals(12345);
  print('Nepali Number: $nepaliNumber');
}
```

With these steps, you are now ready to use the **nepali_utils** package in your Flutter application!

# Complete Example of Nepali Utils in a Flutter App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:nepali_utils/nepali_utils.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Nepali Utils Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Get the current Nepali date
    String nepaliDate = NepaliUtils.formatNepaliDate(DateTime.now());
    // Convert a number to Nepali numerals
    String nepaliNumber = NepaliUtils.convertToNepaliNumerals(12345);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Nepali Utils Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'Current Nepali Date: $nepaliDate',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(
              'Nepali Number: $nepaliNumber',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. HomeScreen is a StatelessWidget that builds the UI.
// 4. Inside HomeScreen, we format the current date to Nepali format and convert a number to Nepali numerals.
// 5. The Scaffold widget provides a structure for the app, including an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 6. The Center widget contains a Column that displays the formatted Nepali date and number.
// 7. The Text widgets show the results on the screen, styled with a font size of 20.
```
