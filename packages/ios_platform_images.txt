# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the iOS Platform Images Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `ios_platform_images` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ios_platform_images: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, ensure that you have the necessary permissions set in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing images from the device's photo library or other sensitive locations. Add the following keys to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires access to your photo library.</string>
```

### Android Configuration

While this package is primarily for iOS, if you are also targeting Android, ensure that you have the necessary configurations in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if you plan to access images from the device.

## Step 4: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to load and display an iOS platform image.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ios_platform_images/ios_platform_images.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('iOS Platform Images Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Image(
            image: IosPlatformImage('your_image_name'), // Replace with your image name
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, replace `'your_image_name'` with the name of the image you want to display. The `IosPlatformImage` class is used to load the image, which is then displayed in the `Image` widget.

# Complete Example of Using the iOS Platform Images Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ios_platform_images/ios_platform_images.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('iOS Platform Images Example'), // Title of the app
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Image(
            image: IosPlatformImage('your_image_name'), // Load the iOS platform image
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the RealFlutter app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.
// 2. The runApp function initializes the app and takes the RealFlutter widget as the root widget.
// 3. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp, which provides the app structure.
// 4. Inside the MaterialApp, a Scaffold widget is created, which provides the basic visual layout structure.
// 5. An AppBar is added to the Scaffold with a title.
// 6. The body of the Scaffold contains a Center widget, which centers its child.
// 7. The child of the Center widget is an Image widget that uses the IosPlatformImage class to load an image.
// 8. The image is displayed in the center of the screen, providing a native iOS look and feel.
```
