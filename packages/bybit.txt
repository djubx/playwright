# Setting Up the Bybit Flutter Package

## Installation
To get started with the Bybit Flutter package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your Flutter project and include the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  bybit: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/bybit).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21.
2. Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file to allow internet access:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key to allow network requests:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Basic Usage
To use the Bybit package, you need to initialize the API client and authenticate the user. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up the client:

```dart
import 'package:bybit/bybit.dart';

void main() {
  final client = BybitClient(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY', secret: 'YOUR_API_SECRET');
  // Now you can use the client to access Bybit's API
}
```

Make sure to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` and `'YOUR_API_SECRET'` with your actual Bybit API credentials.

With this setup, you are ready to start making API calls to Bybit and integrate trading functionalities into your Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Bybit Flutter Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bybit/bybit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Bybit Trading App',
      home: TradingHome(),
    );
  }
}

class TradingHome extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TradingHomeState createState() => _TradingHomeState();
}

class _TradingHomeState extends State<TradingHome> {
  late BybitClient client; // Declare the Bybit client
  String marketData = ''; // Variable to hold market data

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Bybit client with API credentials
    client = BybitClient(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY', secret: 'YOUR_API_SECRET');
    fetchMarketData(); // Fetch market data on initialization
  }

  // Function to fetch market data
  void fetchMarketData() async {
    try {
      // Call the API to get the latest market price for Bitcoin
      final response = await client.getTicker(symbol: 'BTCUSD');
      setState(() {
        marketData = response.result.lastPrice; // Update the market data
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error fetching market data: $e'); // Handle errors
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Bybit Trading App'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Current BTC Price: $marketData', // Display the market data
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: fetchMarketData, // Refresh market data on button press
        tooltip: 'Refresh',
        child: Icon(Icons.refresh),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget sets up the MaterialApp and directs to TradingHome.
// 3. In TradingHome, the Bybit client is initialized with API credentials.
// 4. The fetchMarketData function is called in initState to get the latest BTC price.
// 5. The fetched price is displayed in the center of the screen.
// 6. A FloatingActionButton allows users to refresh the market data manually.
```
