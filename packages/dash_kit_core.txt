# Tutorial: Setting Up Dash Kit Core

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **dash_kit_core** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, add the **dash_kit_core** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  dash_kit_core: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dash_kit_core).

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // or higher
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0' # or higher
```

## Step 4: Importing the Package

In your Dart files, import the package as follows:

```dart
import 'package:dash_kit_core/dash_kit_core.dart';
```

## Step 5: Using Dash Kit Core Widgets

You can now start using the widgets provided by the **dash_kit_core** package in your Flutter application. For example, you can create a simple button using the `DashButton` widget:

```dart
DashButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  child: Text('Click Me'),
);
```

This button can be customized with various properties such as color, size, and shape.

With these steps, you are now ready to build your Flutter application using the **dash_kit_core** package!

# Complete Example: A Simple Flutter Application

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:dash_kit_core/dash_kit_core.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Dash Kit Core Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Dash Kit Core Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: DashButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Action to perform when the button is pressed
            showDialog(
              context: context,
              builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
                title: Text('Button Pressed'),
                content: Text('You have pressed the Dash Button!'),
                actions: [
                  TextButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close the dialog
                    },
                    child: Text('OK'),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Press Me'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to HomePage, which is the main screen of the app.
// 4. HomePage contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered DashButton.
// 5. When the DashButton is pressed, an AlertDialog is displayed, confirming the button press.
// 6. The user can dismiss the dialog by pressing the 'OK' button, which calls Navigator.of(context).pop() to close the dialog.
```
