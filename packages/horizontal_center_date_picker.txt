# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Horizontal Center Date Picker

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To use the `horizontal_center_date_picker` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  horizontal_center_date_picker: ^1.0.0 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get
After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration
### Android
For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS
For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility. Make sure to uncomment the platform line and set it to at least 10.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

## Step 4: Using the Date Picker
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Below is an example of how to implement the `horizontal_center_date_picker` in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:horizontal_center_date_picker/horizontal_center_date_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Horizontal Center Date Picker Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: HorizontalCenterDatePicker(
            initialDate: DateTime.now(),
            onDateChanged: (selectedDate) {
              // Handle the date change
              print("Selected date: $selectedDate");
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter application that uses the `HorizontalCenterDatePicker`. The `onDateChanged` callback allows you to handle the selected date.

## Summary
In this tutorial, we covered how to set up the `horizontal_center_date_picker` package in your Flutter application, including platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS. We also demonstrated how to implement the date picker in a simple app.

# Complete Example of Horizontal Center Date Picker

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:horizontal_center_date_picker/horizontal_center_date_picker.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Horizontal Center Date Picker Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: HorizontalCenterDatePicker(
            initialDate: DateTime.now(), // Set the initial date to today
            onDateChanged: (selectedDate) {
              // This callback is triggered when the user selects a date
              print("Selected date: $selectedDate"); // Log the selected date
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter()); // Run the app
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title "Horizontal Center Date Picker Example".
// 4. In the body of the Scaffold, we center the HorizontalCenterDatePicker widget.
// 5. The date picker is initialized with the current date and has an onDateChanged callback.
// 6. When the user selects a date, the selected date is printed to the console.
