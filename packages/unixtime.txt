# Overview of the "unixtime" Flutter Package

The `unixtime` package is a lightweight and efficient Flutter package designed to handle Unix timestamps seamlessly. Unix timestamps are widely used in programming to represent time as the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 (UTC). This package simplifies the conversion between Unix timestamps and Dart's `DateTime` objects, making it easier for developers to work with time-related data in their applications.

## When to Use `unixtime`
- **APIs**: When working with APIs that return timestamps in Unix format.
- **Databases**: For applications that store time data as Unix timestamps.
- **Time Calculations**: When performing calculations involving time intervals.

## Key Features
- **Conversion**: Easily convert between Unix timestamps and Dart `DateTime` objects.
- **Formatting**: Format timestamps into human-readable date and time strings.
- **Timezone Handling**: Manage timezones effectively when converting timestamps.

# Setting Up and Using the `unixtime` Package

## Installation
To add the `unixtime` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  unixtime: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
The `unixtime` package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. There are no additional configurations required for either platform, making it easy to integrate into your Flutter application.

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the `unixtime` package in your Flutter application:

1. Import the package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:unixtime/unixtime.dart';
   ```

2. Convert a Unix timestamp to a `DateTime` object:
   ```dart
   int unixTimestamp = 1633072800; // Example timestamp
   DateTime dateTime = UnixTime.fromUnix(unixTimestamp);
   ```

3. Convert a `DateTime` object back to a Unix timestamp:
   ```dart
   DateTime now = DateTime.now();
   int timestamp = UnixTime.toUnix(now);
   ```

4. Format the timestamp:
   ```dart
   String formattedDate = UnixTime.format(unixTimestamp, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss');
   ```

With these simple steps, you can effectively manage Unix timestamps in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Using the `unixtime` Package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:unixtime/unixtime.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'UnixTime Example',
      home: UnixTimeExample(),
    );
  }
}

class UnixTimeExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Example Unix timestamp
    int unixTimestamp = 1633072800; // Represents 2021-10-01 00:00:00 UTC

    // Convert Unix timestamp to DateTime
    DateTime dateTime = UnixTime.fromUnix(unixTimestamp);

    // Convert current DateTime to Unix timestamp
    DateTime now = DateTime.now();
    int currentTimestamp = UnixTime.toUnix(now);

    // Format the Unix timestamp into a readable string
    String formattedDate = UnixTime.format(unixTimestamp, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss');

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('UnixTime Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Unix Timestamp: $unixTimestamp'),
            Text('Converted DateTime: $dateTime'),
            Text('Current Unix Timestamp: $currentTimestamp'),
            Text('Formatted Date: $formattedDate'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home widget (UnixTimeExample).
// 3. In the UnixTimeExample widget, we define a Unix timestamp and convert it to a DateTime object.
// 4. We also get the current DateTime and convert it to a Unix timestamp.
// 5. The Unix timestamp is formatted into a human-readable string.
// 6. Finally, we display the Unix timestamp, converted DateTime, current timestamp, and formatted date in the app's UI.
