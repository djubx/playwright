Here's a detailed technical blog on the "conditional_builder_null_safety" Flutter package, structured as requested.

<!-- START_DESCRIPTION -->
# Conditional Builder Null Safety in Flutter

The `conditional_builder_null_safety` package is a powerful utility for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of building widgets conditionally based on the state of your application. This package is particularly useful when dealing with asynchronous data fetching, where you may want to display different widgets based on whether the data is loading, has been successfully fetched, or has encountered an error.

## When to Use This Package

You should consider using the `conditional_builder_null_safety` package in scenarios such as:

- **Asynchronous Data Loading**: When fetching data from an API, you can show a loading spinner while the data is being fetched, display the data once it's available, or show an error message if the fetch fails.
- **Form Validation**: In forms, you can conditionally display validation messages or success indicators based on user input.
- **Feature Toggles**: You can show or hide features based on user permissions or application state.

## Features

- **Null Safety**: The package is built with null safety in mind, ensuring that your code is safe from null dereference errors.
- **Flexible Conditions**: You can easily define conditions for displaying different widgets.
- **Customizable**: The package allows for customization of loading, error, and success states.

## Example Usage

Here’s a simple example of how you might use the `conditional_builder_null_safety` package:

```dart
ConditionalBuilder(
  condition: isLoading,
  builder: (context) => CircularProgressIndicator(),
  fallback: (context) => Text('Data Loaded!'),
);
```

In this example, if `isLoading` is true, a loading spinner is displayed; otherwise, a text widget is shown.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Conditional Builder Null Safety

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To use the `conditional_builder_null_safety` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  conditional_builder_null_safety: ^1.0.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package at the top:

```dart
import 'package:conditional_builder_null_safety/conditional_builder_null_safety.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Conditional Builder

You can now use the `ConditionalBuilder` widget in your Flutter application. Here’s how to implement it in a simple app:

### Android and iOS Specific Configurations

For both Android and iOS, no specific configurations are required for this package. However, ensure that your Flutter SDK is up to date to avoid compatibility issues.

### Example Implementation

Here’s a basic implementation of the `ConditionalBuilder` in a Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:conditional_builder_null_safety/conditional_builder_null_safety.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    bool isLoading = true; // Simulating loading state

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Conditional Builder Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ConditionalBuilder(
          condition: isLoading,
          builder: (context) => CircularProgressIndicator(),
          fallback: (context) => Text('Data Loaded!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the app displays a loading spinner while `isLoading` is true and shows "Data Loaded!" when it is false.

# Complete Example of Conditional Builder Null Safety

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:conditional_builder_null_safety/conditional_builder_null_safety.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Simulating different states
    bool isLoading = false; // Change this to true to see the loading indicator
    bool hasError = false; // Change this to true to see the error message

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Conditional Builder Example')),
      body: Center(
        child: ConditionalBuilder(
          // Condition to check if data is loading
          condition: isLoading,
          // Widget to display while loading
          builder: (context) => CircularProgressIndicator(),
          // Fallback widget to display when loading is complete
          fallback: (context) {
            // Check if there was an error
            if (hasError) {
              return Text('Error loading data!'); // Display error message
            } else {
              return Text('Data Loaded!'); // Display success message
            }
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with HomeScreen as the home widget.
// 3. In HomeScreen, we simulate loading and error states with boolean variables.
// 4. The ConditionalBuilder checks the isLoading condition.
// 5. If isLoading is true, a CircularProgressIndicator is displayed.
// 6. If isLoading is false, it checks hasError.
// 7. If hasError is true, an error message is displayed; otherwise, a success message is shown.
```
