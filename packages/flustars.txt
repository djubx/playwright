# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flustars

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Flustars package and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.

## Step 1: Adding Flustars to Your Project

To get started, you need to add the Flustars package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flustars: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # Ensure this is set to at least 10.0
```

## Step 3: Using Flustars in Your Application

Now that you have set up Flustars, you can start using its features. Below is an example of how to use some of the utilities provided by Flustars.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flustars/flustars.dart';
```

2. Use the utilities in your application. For example, you can format a date:

```dart
String formattedDate = DateUtil.formatDate(DateTime.now(), format: 'yyyy-MM-dd');
print(formattedDate);  // Outputs the current date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format
```

3. You can also manipulate strings:

```dart
String trimmedString = StringUtil.trim('   Hello, Flustars!   ');
print(trimmedString);  // Outputs 'Hello, Flustars!'
```

With these simple steps, you can leverage the power of Flustars in your Flutter applications.

# Complete Example of Flustars in Action

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flustars/flustars.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flustars Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flustars Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              // Display the current date formatted
              Text(
                'Current Date: ${DateUtil.formatDate(DateTime.now(), format: 'yyyy-MM-dd')}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Display a trimmed string
              Text(
                'Trimmed String: ${StringUtil.trim('   Hello, Flustars!   ')}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Example of filtering a list
              Text(
                'Filtered List: ${ListUtil.filter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], (item) => item > 3)}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the Flutter application by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar and a Center widget that centers its child widgets.
// 4. Inside the Center widget, a Column is used to arrange multiple Text widgets vertically.
// 5. The first Text widget displays the current date formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD' using DateUtil from Flustars.
// 6. The second Text widget shows a trimmed version of a string using StringUtil from Flustars.
// 7. The third Text widget demonstrates filtering a list to show only items greater than 3 using ListUtil from Flustars.
// 8. The application showcases the utility of Flustars in handling dates, strings, and collections efficiently.
