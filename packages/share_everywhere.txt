```

Make sure to replace `latest_version` with the most recent version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/share_everywhere).

### Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

2. Ensure you have the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

#### iOS

1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following key to allow sharing:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to share images.</string>
```

### Using the Package

To use the `share_everywhere` package, you can import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:share_everywhere/share_everywhere.dart';
```

You can then use the `ShareEverywhere` class to share content. Hereâ€™s a simple example of sharing text:

```dart
void shareText(String text) {
  ShareEverywhere.shareText(text);
}
```

For sharing images or files, you can use:

```dart
void shareImage(String imagePath) {
  ShareEverywhere.shareImage(imagePath);
}
```

Make sure to handle any potential errors when sharing content to enhance user experience.

## Complete Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:share_everywhere/share_everywhere.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Share Everywhere Example',
      home: ShareHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class ShareHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Share Everywhere Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Call the method to share text
                shareText("Hello from RealFlutter!");
              },
              child: Text('Share Text'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Call the method to share an image
                shareImage("path/to/your/image.png");
              },
              child: Text('Share Image'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  // Method to share text using the share_everywhere package
  void shareText(String text) {
    ShareEverywhere.shareText(text);
  }

  // Method to share an image using the share_everywhere package
  void shareImage(String imagePath) {
    ShareEverywhere.shareImage(imagePath);
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home page.
// 3. The ShareHomePage widget contains two buttons for sharing text and images.
// 4. When the "Share Text" button is pressed, the shareText method is called, which uses the ShareEverywhere class to share the specified text.
// 5. When the "Share Image" button is pressed, the shareImage method is called, which uses the ShareEverywhere class to share the specified image.
// 6. The app provides a simple interface for users to share content easily.
```
