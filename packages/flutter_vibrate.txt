# Setting Up and Using the `flutter_vibrate` Package

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_vibrate` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_vibrate: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

1. **Permissions**: Ensure that your Android app has the necessary permissions to use vibration. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/` and add the following permission:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>
   ```

2. **Vibration Settings**: You may also want to check the device's vibration settings to ensure that the device is capable of vibrating.

### iOS

1. **Permissions**: For iOS, you do not need to add any specific permissions for vibration. However, ensure that your app's settings allow for haptic feedback.

## Step 3: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_vibrate/flutter_vibrate.dart';
```

## Step 4: Using the Package

You can now use the `flutter_vibrate` package in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to trigger a vibration:

```dart
if (await Vibrate.canVibrate) {
  Vibrate.vibrate();
}
```

This code checks if the device can vibrate and then triggers a vibration.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we covered how to set up the `flutter_vibrate` package in your Flutter application, including platform-specific configurations for Android and iOS. You can now easily implement vibration feedback in your app to enhance user experience.

# Complete Example of Using `flutter_vibrate`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_vibrate/flutter_vibrate.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Vibrate Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Vibration Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              // Check if the device can vibrate
              if (await Vibrate.canVibrate) {
                // Trigger a simple vibration
                Vibrate.vibrate();
              } else {
                // Show a message if the device cannot vibrate
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                  SnackBar(content: Text('This device cannot vibrate')),
                );
              }
            },
            child: Text('Vibrate'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold.
// 3. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title 'Vibration Example'.
// 4. The body of the Scaffold has a Center widget that contains an ElevatedButton.
// 5. When the button is pressed, it checks if the device can vibrate using Vibrate.canVibrate.
// 6. If the device can vibrate, it triggers a vibration using Vibrate.vibrate().
// 7. If the device cannot vibrate, it shows a SnackBar message indicating that the device cannot vibrate.
