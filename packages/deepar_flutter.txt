# DeepAR Flutter Package
==========================

The DeepAR Flutter package is a powerful tool for creating augmented reality (AR) experiences in Flutter applications. It provides a simple and intuitive API for developers to integrate AR features into their apps.

## When to Use
--------------

The DeepAR Flutter package is ideal for applications that require AR capabilities, such as:

* Virtual try-on
* 3D modeling and visualization
* Interactive storytelling
* Gaming

## Features
------------

* Support for 3D models and animations
* Advanced face tracking and detection
* Image and video processing
* Integration with popular AR platforms

# Setting Up the DeepAR Flutter Package
=====================================

## Step 1: Add the Package to Your Project
-----------------------------------------

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yml
dependencies:
  deepar_flutter: ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Step 2: Import the Package
-----------------------------

Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:deepar_flutter/deepar_flutter.dart';
```
## Step 3: Initialize the Package
---------------------------------

Initialize the package in your `main` function:
```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  DeepAR.initialize();
}
```
## Platform-Specific Details
---------------------------

### Android

* Add the following permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```
* Update your `build.gradle` file to include the following dependencies:
```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.deepar:deepar-sdk:1.0.0'
}
```
### iOS

* Add the following permission to your `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs camera access to work</string>
```
* Update your `Podfile` to include the following dependencies:
```ruby
pod 'DeepAR'
```

// This is the main entry point of the application.
// The MyApp widget is created and run.

// The MyHomePage widget is created and displayed.
// The user can load a 3D model by pressing the "Load 3D Model" button.
// The user can start the AR experience by pressing the "Start AR Experience" button.

// When the user loads a 3D model, the _loadModel function is called.
// This function loads a 3D model from a file using the DeepAR package.

// When the user starts the AR experience, the _startAR function is called.
// This function starts the AR experience using the DeepAR package.

// The AR experience is displayed on the screen.
// The user can interact with the 3D model in the AR experience.

// This is the end of the application flow.
