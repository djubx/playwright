# Tutorial: Setting Up the Subtitle Wrapper Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `subtitle_wrapper_package` and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Add Dependency

To get started, add the `subtitle_wrapper_package` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  subtitle_wrapper_package: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file if you are accessing local files for subtitles:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to load subtitle files.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage

Now that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `subtitle_wrapper_package` in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:subtitle_wrapper_package/subtitle_wrapper_package.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Subtitle Wrapper Example',
      home: SubtitleExample(),
    );
  }
}

class SubtitleExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SubtitleExampleState createState() => _SubtitleExampleState();
}

class _SubtitleExampleState extends State<SubtitleExample> {
  // List of subtitle tracks
  final List<SubtitleTrack> _tracks = [
    SubtitleTrack('English', 'assets/subtitles/english.srt'),
    SubtitleTrack('Spanish', 'assets/subtitles/spanish.srt'),
  ];

  // Current selected track
  SubtitleTrack? _currentTrack;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Set the default subtitle track
    _currentTrack = _tracks[0];
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Subtitle Wrapper Example'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Video player widget (placeholder)
          Container(
            height: 300,
            color: Colors.black,
            child: Center(child: Text('Video Player Placeholder', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white))),
          ),
          // Subtitle wrapper
          SubtitleWrapper(
            track: _currentTrack,
            child: Container(
              height: 100,
              color: Colors.black54,
              child: Center(
                child: Text(
                  'Subtitle will appear here',
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
          // Dropdown to select subtitle track
          DropdownButton<SubtitleTrack>(
            value: _currentTrack,
            onChanged: (SubtitleTrack? newValue) {
              setState(() {
                _currentTrack = newValue;
              });
            },
            items: _tracks.map<DropdownMenuItem<SubtitleTrack>>((SubtitleTrack track) {
              return DropdownMenuItem<SubtitleTrack>(
                value: track,
                child: Text(track.language),
              );
            }).toList(),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up a MaterialApp with a title and home widget.
// 3. The SubtitleExample widget is created, which manages the state of the subtitle tracks.
// 4. In the initState method, the default subtitle track is set to English.
// 5. The build method constructs the UI, including a placeholder for the video player and a SubtitleWrapper.
// 6. The SubtitleWrapper displays the current subtitle track, and a dropdown allows users to switch between available tracks.
// 7. When a new track is selected from the dropdown, the state is updated, and the UI reflects the change.
