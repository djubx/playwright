# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Expanded Tile Package

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `flutter_expanded_tile` package in a Flutter project. We will cover platform-specific details for both Android and iOS, ensuring a smooth integration.

## Setup

1. **Add Dependency**

   First, add the `flutter_expanded_tile` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_expanded_tile: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Install Packages**

   Run the following command to install the new package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**

   - **Android**: Ensure your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

     ```gradle
     defaultConfig {
         minSdkVersion 21
     }
     ```

   - **iOS**: No additional configuration is required for iOS.

## Usage

To use the `flutter_expanded_tile` package, import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_expanded_tile/flutter_expanded_tile.dart';
```

### Creating an Expanded Tile

Here's a simple example of how to create an expanded tile using the `RealFlutter` class:

```dart
ExpandedTile(
  title: Text('Tap to Expand'),
  content: Text('This is the expanded content.'),
  onTap: () {
    // Handle tap event
  },
)
```

### Customizing the Tile

You can customize the tile's appearance and behavior by using various properties:

- `title`: The widget displayed when the tile is collapsed.
- `content`: The widget displayed when the tile is expanded.
- `leading`: An optional widget to display before the title.
- `trailing`: An optional widget to display after the title.
- `onTap`: A callback function triggered when the tile is tapped.

            ),
            onTap: () {
              // Handle tap event for Tile 1
            },
          ),
          // Creating the second expanded tile
          ExpandedTile(
            title: Text('Tile 2: Tap to Expand'),
            content: Column(
              crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
              children: <Widget>[
                Text('This is the expanded content of Tile 2.'),
                Text('Add any widget you like.'),
              ],
            ),
            onTap: () {
              // Handle tap event for Tile 2
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with RealFlutterApp.
// RealFlutterApp is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// RealFlutterHomePage is the home screen of the app, containing a Scaffold with an AppBar and a ListView.
// The ListView contains multiple ExpandedTile widgets, each with a title and expandable content.
// Each ExpandedTile can be tapped to reveal its content, and the onTap callback can be used to handle tap events.
// The ExpandedTile widget allows for flexible content, making it easy to add any widget within the expanded area.
