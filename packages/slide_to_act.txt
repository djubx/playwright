# Complete Example of Slide to Act

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:slide_to_act/slide_to_act.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Slide to Act Example',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Slide to Act Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SlideToActExample(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SlideToActExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
      child: SlideAction(
        text: 'Slide to Confirm',
        onSubmit: () {
          // Action to perform on slide completion
          ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
            SnackBar(content: Text('Action confirmed!')),
          );
        },
        // Customize the appearance
        outerColor: Colors.blue,
        innerColor: Colors.green,
        textStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with MyApp.
// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a centered SlideToActExample widget.
// 3. SlideToActExample builds a SlideAction widget with a text label and an onSubmit callback.
// 4. When the user slides the button to the end, the onSubmit callback is triggered, showing a SnackBar with a confirmation message.
// 5. The SlideAction widget is customizable, allowing changes to colors and text styles to fit the app's design.
