                // Handle Facebook sign-in logic here
              },
              child: Text('Sign in with Facebook'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // Apple sign-in button
            SignButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Handle Apple sign-in logic here
              },
              child: Text('Sign in with Apple'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// The app starts by running the RealFlutter widget, which is a stateless widget that wraps the entire app.
// The RealFlutter widget uses the MaterialApp widget to define the app's title and theme.
// The home property of the MaterialApp widget is set to the SignInPage widget, which is a stateless widget that defines the sign-in page.
// The SignInPage widget uses the Scaffold widget to define the page's layout, including the app bar and body.
// The body of the Scaffold widget is a Center widget that contains a Column widget.
// The Column widget contains three SignButton widgets, each representing a different sign-in option (Google, Facebook, and Apple).
// Each SignButton widget has an onPressed property that is used to handle the sign-in logic for the corresponding platform.
```

// The app's flow is as follows:
// 1. The user opens the app and is presented with the sign-in page.
// 2. The user selects a sign-in option (Google, Facebook, or Apple) by pressing the corresponding button.
// 3. The app handles the sign-in logic for the selected platform using the onPressed property of the SignButton widget.
// 4. Once the sign-in logic is complete, the app can proceed to the next step, such as displaying the user's profile information or allowing them to access protected content.
