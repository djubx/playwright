# Connection Status Bar Flutter Package

The `connection_status_bar` Flutter package is a useful tool for developers looking to provide real-time feedback on the network connectivity status of their applications. This package allows you to display a status bar at the top of your app that indicates whether the device is online or offline, enhancing user experience by keeping users informed about their connectivity.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Connection Status Bar Package

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `connection_status_bar` package to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  connection_status_bar: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/connection_status_bar).

## Step 2: Importing the Package

In your Dart file, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:connection_status_bar/connection_status_bar.dart';
```

## Step 3: Using the Connection Status Bar

You can use the `ConnectionStatusBar` widget in your app's widget tree. Here’s how to do it:

### For Android

1. Ensure that your Android project has the necessary permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

2. The package should work out of the box without additional configurations.

### For iOS

1. Open your `Info.plist` file and add the following key to request permission for network access:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

2. The package should work seamlessly without further configurations.

## Step 4: Implementing the Connection Status Bar

You can now implement the `ConnectionStatusBar` in your widget tree. Here’s a simple example:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Connection Status Bar Example')),
    body: Column(
      children: [
        ConnectionStatusBar(
          // Customize the status bar
          barHeight: 30.0,
          color: Colors.red,
          textColor: Colors.white,
        ),
        // Your main content goes here
      ],
    ),
  );
}
```

This will display a connection status bar at the top of your app, which will change color based on the connectivity status.

With these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `connection_status_bar` package in your Flutter application effectively.

# Complete Example of Using Connection Status Bar

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:connection_status_bar/connection_status_bar.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Connection Status Bar Example',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Connection Status Bar Example')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // ConnectionStatusBar widget to show connectivity status
          ConnectionStatusBar(
            barHeight: 30.0, // Height of the status bar
            color: Colors.red, // Color when offline
            textColor: Colors.white, // Text color
          ),
          // Main content of the app
          Expanded(
            child: Center(
              child: Text(
                'Welcome to the Connection Status Bar Example!',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home screen.
// 3. The HomeScreen widget contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body.
// 4. The body consists of a Column that first includes the ConnectionStatusBar widget.
// 5. The ConnectionStatusBar displays the current network status at the top of the screen.
// 6. Below the status bar, the main content of the app is displayed, which is a simple welcome message.
// 7. The ConnectionStatusBar automatically updates its appearance based on the device's connectivity status.
