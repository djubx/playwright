# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the ZXing Widget

In this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `zxing_widget` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency
To get started, add the `zxing_widget` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  zxing_widget: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/zxing_widget).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21
    }
}
```

2. Add camera permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

### iOS Configuration
1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys to request camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to scan barcodes.</string>
```

## Step 3: Using the ZXing Widget
Now that we have set up the package, we can use it in our Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the barcode scanner.

<!-- END_TUTORIAL -->

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:zxing_widget/zxing_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'ZXing Widget Example',
      home: ScannerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ScannerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ScannerScreenState createState() => _ScannerScreenState();
}

class _ScannerScreenState extends State<ScannerScreen> {
  String result = "Scan a barcode";

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Barcode Scanner'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            // Display the result of the scan
            Text(result, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20)),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            // ZXing widget for scanning
            ZXingWidget(
              onScan: (String scannedData) {
                // Update the result with the scanned data
                setState(() {
                  result = scannedData;
                });
              },
              // Specify the barcode formats to scan
              formats: [BarcodeFormat.qr, BarcodeFormat.ean13],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter is a StatelessWidget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and home screen.
// 3. The ScannerScreen is a StatefulWidget that maintains the state of the scanned result.
// 4. In the build method of ScannerScreen, we create a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.
// 5. Inside the Center widget, we display the result of the scan and include the ZXingWidget.
// 6. The ZXingWidget listens for scanned data and updates the result state when a barcode is scanned.
// 7. The app supports scanning QR codes and EAN-13 barcodes, displaying the scanned result on the screen.
```
