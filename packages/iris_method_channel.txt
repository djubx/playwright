# iris_method_channel Flutter Package

The `iris_method_channel` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to bridge the gap between Flutter and native platform code. This package allows you to create method channels that facilitate communication between Dart and native code (Java/Kotlin for Android and Objective-C/Swift for iOS). 

## When to Use This Package
You might consider using `iris_method_channel` when:
- You need to access platform-specific features that are not available in Flutter.
- You want to implement custom native functionality that requires direct interaction with the platform's APIs.
- You are building a plugin that requires communication between Flutter and native code.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
- **Custom Method Channels**: Easily create and manage method channels for communication.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Supports asynchronous calls, allowing for non-blocking operations.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions during method calls.

Overall, `iris_method_channel` is an essential package for developers looking to extend the capabilities of their Flutter applications by leveraging native platform features.

# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using iris_method_channel

## Installation
To add the `iris_method_channel` package to your Flutter project, include it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  iris_method_channel: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/iris_method_channel).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Ensure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

3. Add any necessary permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` if your native code requires them.

### iOS
1. Open your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add any required permissions or configurations that your native code may need.

## Using the Package
To use the `iris_method_channel`, you will need to create a method channel in your Dart code and implement the corresponding native code.

### Dart Code Example
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iris_method_channel/iris_method_channel.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _response = "Waiting for response...";

  // Create a method channel
  final IrisMethodChannel _channel = IrisMethodChannel('com.example.methodchannel');

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Call the native method when the app starts
    _callNativeMethod();
  }

  Future<void> _callNativeMethod() async {
    try {
      // Call the native method and await the response
      final String result = await _channel.invokeMethod('getNativeData');
      setState(() {
        _response = result; // Update the response with the result from native code
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _response = "Error: $e"; // Handle any errors
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Iris Method Channel Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(_response), // Display the response from native code
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a method channel named `com.example.methodchannel` and invoke a native method called `getNativeData`. The response is displayed in the center of the screen.

# Complete Example of iris_method_channel

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:iris_method_channel/iris_method_channel.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _response = "Waiting for response..."; // Initial response message

  // Create a method channel
  final IrisMethodChannel _channel = IrisMethodChannel('com.example.methodchannel');

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Call the native method when the app starts
    _callNativeMethod();
  }

  Future<void> _callNativeMethod() async {
    try {
      // Call the native method and await the response
      final String result = await _channel.invokeMethod('getNativeData');
      setState(() {
        _response = result; // Update the response with the result from native code
      });
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _response = "Error: $e"; // Handle any errors
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Iris Method Channel Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(_response), // Display the response from native code
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts and the RealFlutter widget is created.
// 2. In the initState method, _callNativeMethod is called to invoke the native method.
// 3. The _callNativeMethod function uses the method channel to call 'getNativeData'.
// 4. If the call is successful, the response is updated and displayed on the screen.
// 5. If an error occurs, the error message is displayed instead.
```

### Summary
In this blog post, we explored the `iris_method_channel` Flutter package, which allows for seamless communication between Flutter and native code. We covered the installation process, platform-specific configurations, and provided a complete example demonstrating how to set up and use the package effectively. The example illustrates how to invoke a native method and handle responses, making it a valuable resource for developers looking to enhance their Flutter applications with native functionality.
