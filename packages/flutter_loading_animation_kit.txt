# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Flutter Loading Animation Kit

## Step 1: Adding the Dependency

To get started, you need to add the `flutter_loading_animation_kit` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_loading_animation_kit: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android

For Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### iOS

For iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher
```

## Step 3: Using the Package

Now that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a loading animation.

1. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_loading_animation_kit/flutter_loading_animation_kit.dart';
```

2. Use the loading animation widget in your UI:

```dart
LoadingAnimationWidget.staggeredDotWave(
  color: Colors.blue,
  size: 50,
);
```

You can customize the color and size as per your requirements.

## Step 4: Example Usage

In the next section, we will provide a complete example demonstrating how to implement the loading animation in a Flutter application.

# Complete Example of Flutter Loading Animation Kit

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_loading_animation_kit/flutter_loading_animation_kit.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Loading Animation Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: LoadingScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class LoadingScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _LoadingScreenState createState() => _LoadingScreenState();
}

class _LoadingScreenState extends State<LoadingScreen> {
  bool _isLoading = true; // State variable to track loading status

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _simulateLoading(); // Start the loading simulation
  }

  // Simulate a network request
  void _simulateLoading() async {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3)); // Simulate a 3-second delay
    setState(() {
      _isLoading = false; // Update loading status
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Loading Animation Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _isLoading
            ? LoadingAnimationWidget.staggeredDotWave(
                color: Colors.blue, // Customize the color
                size: 50, // Customize the size
              )
            : Text(
                'Data Loaded!', // Display this when loading is complete
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// 2. RealFlutter sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.
// 3. The home screen is set to LoadingScreen, which manages the loading state.
// 4. In the LoadingScreen, a boolean variable _isLoading is initialized to true.
// 5. The initState method calls _simulateLoading, which simulates a network request.
// 6. After a 3-second delay, the loading state is updated to false.
// 7. The build method checks the loading state: if true, it shows the loading animation; if false, it displays "Data Loaded!".
```
