# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Quick Look

## Step 1: Adding Dependency
To get started with the **quick_look** package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  quick_look: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/quick_look).

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
For Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access the internet and read external storage if you are loading images from the device. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS
For iOS, you need to add the following keys to your `Info.plist` file to allow access to the photo library:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to show previews.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos.</string>
```

## Step 3: Basic Usage
Now that you have set up the package, you can use it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the **quick_look** package in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:quick_look/quick_look.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Quick Look Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the quick look preview
              QuickLook.show(
                context: context,
                items: [
                  QuickLookItem(
                    url: 'https://example.com/image.jpg', // URL of the image
                    type: QuickLookItemType.image, // Specify the type
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Preview'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, it triggers the quick look preview for the specified image URL.

# Complete Example of Quick Look in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:quick_look/quick_look.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Quick Look Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Trigger the quick look preview
              QuickLook.show(
                context: context,
                items: [
                  QuickLookItem(
                    url: 'https://example.com/image.jpg', // URL of the image
                    type: QuickLookItemType.image, // Specify the type
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
            child: Text('Show Preview'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Application Flow Explanation:
// 1. The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.
// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.
// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the app's visual structure, including an AppBar and a body.
// 4. In the body, a Center widget is used to center the content.
// 5. An ElevatedButton is created, which, when pressed, triggers the QuickLook.show method.
// 6. The QuickLook.show method takes the current context and a list of QuickLookItem objects.
// 7. Each QuickLookItem specifies the URL of the media and its type (image in this case).
// 8. When the button is pressed, the quick look preview is displayed, allowing users to view the image without leaving the current screen.
