```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/password_strength_indicator_plus).

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Details
### Android
No additional configuration is required for Android. Just ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

### iOS

## Usage
To use the `password_strength_indicator_plus` package, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:password_strength_indicator_plus/password_strength_indicator_plus.dart';
   ```

2. Create a stateful widget to manage the password input and strength indicator.

3. Use the `PasswordStrengthIndicator` widget to display the strength of the password.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement it in your Flutter application.

<!-- START_MAIN -->
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:password_strength_indicator_plus/password_strength_indicator_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(RealFlutter());
}

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  // Controller to manage the password input
  final TextEditingController _passwordController = TextEditingController();
  // Variable to hold the password strength
  double _passwordStrength = 0.0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Password Strength Indicator Plus Example'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              // TextField for password input
              TextField(
                controller: _passwordController,
                obscureText: true, // Hides the password input
                decoration: InputDecoration(
                  labelText: 'Enter Password',
                  border: OutlineInputBorder(),
                ),
                // Update password strength on text change
                onChanged: (value) {
                  setState(() {
                    _passwordStrength = PasswordStrengthIndicatorPlus.getStrength(value);
                  });
                },
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Password strength indicator
              PasswordStrengthIndicator(
                strength: _passwordStrength,
                // Customizing the appearance
                height: 10,
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              // Displaying the strength level
              Text(
                'Password Strength: ${(_passwordStrength * 100).toStringAsFixed(0)}%',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

// The above code creates a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the password strength indicator.
// 1. The `main` function initializes the app by running the `RealFlutter` widget.
// 2. The `RealFlutter` widget is a stateful widget that manages the password input and its strength.
// 3. A `TextEditingController` is used to capture the password input from the user.
// 4. The `TextField` widget allows users to enter their password, and the `onChanged` callback updates the password strength in real-time.
// 5. The `PasswordStrengthIndicator` widget visually represents the strength of the password based on the input.
// 6. Finally, a `Text` widget displays the percentage of password strength to the user, providing clear feedback.
