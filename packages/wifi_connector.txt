# Overview of the wifi_connector Flutter Package

The `wifi_connector` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to manage Wi-Fi connections within their applications. This package allows you to connect to, disconnect from, and manage Wi-Fi networks programmatically, making it ideal for applications that require network connectivity management, such as IoT applications, network monitoring tools, or any app that needs to interact with Wi-Fi networks.

## When to Use This Package
- **IoT Applications**: If your app needs to connect to IoT devices over Wi-Fi.
- **Network Management Tools**: For apps that monitor or manage Wi-Fi connections.
- **Custom Network Solutions**: When you need to provide users with the ability to connect to specific networks.

## Key Features
- **Connect to Wi-Fi**: Easily connect to a specified Wi-Fi network using SSID and password.
- **Disconnect from Wi-Fi**: Disconnect from the currently connected Wi-Fi network.
- **List Available Networks**: Retrieve a list of available Wi-Fi networks.
- **Check Connection Status**: Determine if the device is currently connected to a Wi-Fi network.

The `wifi_connector` package simplifies the process of managing Wi-Fi connections, providing a straightforward API for developers.

# Setting Up and Using the wifi_connector Package

## Installation
To use the `wifi_connector` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wifi_connector: ^latest_version
```

Make sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/wifi_connector).

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android
1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

### iOS
1. Open your `Info.plist` file located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add the following keys to request permission for location services:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your location to find Wi-Fi networks.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your location to find Wi-Fi networks.</string>
```

## Using the Package
After setting up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to connect to a Wi-Fi network.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wifi_connector/wifi_connector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _status = "Disconnected";

  void _connectToWifi() async {
    String ssid = "Your_SSID";
    String password = "Your_Password";

    // Attempt to connect to the specified Wi-Fi network
    bool result = await WifiConnector.connect(ssid, password);
    setState(() {
      _status = result ? "Connected to $ssid" : "Failed to connect";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Wi-Fi Connector Example")),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(_status),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _connectToWifi,
              child: Text("Connect to Wi-Fi"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a simple UI with a button to connect to a specified Wi-Fi network and displays the connection status.

# Complete Example of Using wifi_connector

```dart

import 'package:wifi_connector/wifi_connector.dart';

class RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();
}

class _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {
  String _status = "Disconnected"; // Initialize connection status

  // Function to connect to a Wi-Fi network
  void _connectToWifi() async {
    String ssid = "Your_SSID"; // Replace with your Wi-Fi SSID
    String password = "Your_Password"; // Replace with your Wi-Fi password

    // Attempt to connect to the specified Wi-Fi network
    bool result = await WifiConnector.connect(ssid, password);
    setState(() {
      // Update the status based on the connection result
      _status = result ? "Connected to $ssid" : "Failed to connect";
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Wi-Fi Connector Example")), // App bar title
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(_status), // Display current connection status
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _connectToWifi, // Connect button
              child: Text("Connect to Wi-Fi"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: RealFlutter(), // Run the RealFlutter widget
  ));
}
```

```
// The application starts with the main function, which runs the RealFlutter widget.
// The RealFlutter widget is a StatefulWidget that maintains the connection status.
// The _connectToWifi function is called when the user presses the "Connect to Wi-Fi" button.
// It attempts to connect to the specified SSID with the provided password.
// The connection result updates the _status variable, which is displayed on the screen.
// The UI consists of a simple text display for the connection status and a button to initiate the connection.
