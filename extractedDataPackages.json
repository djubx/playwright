    "description": "# Fixnum Flutter Package\n\nThe **fixnum** package is a Dart library that provides support for fixed-size integers. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to work with large integers that exceed the limits of Dart's built-in integer type. This package is essential for applications that require precise arithmetic operations, such as cryptography, data serialization, and performance-sensitive applications.\n\n## When to Use Fixnum\n\nYou should consider using the fixnum package in the following scenarios:\n\n- **Large Integer Calculations**: When dealing with integers larger than 2^53, which is the maximum safe integer in JavaScript and Dart.\n- **Performance Optimization**: If your application requires high-performance arithmetic operations, using fixed-size integers can lead to better performance compared to Dart's native integers.\n- **Interoperability with Protocol Buffers**: The fixnum package is often used in conjunction with Protocol Buffers, where fixed-size integers are required for serialization.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Fixed-Size Integers**: Supports 32-bit and 64-bit integers.\n- **Arithmetic Operations**: Provides basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n- **Serialization Support**: Easily serialize and deserialize fixed-size integers for network communication or storage.",

    "tutorial": "# Tutorial: Setting Up Firebase UI Localizations\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `firebase_ui_localizations` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.\n\n## Step 1: Add Dependencies\n\nFirst, you need to add the `firebase_ui_localizations` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Make sure to also include the necessary Firebase packages.\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  firebase_core: ^latest_version\n  firebase_auth: ^latest_version\n  firebase_ui_localizations: ^latest_version\n```\n\n## Step 2: Initialize Firebase\n\nBefore using Firebase services, you need to initialize Firebase in your application. This is typically done in the `main.dart` file.\n\n### Android Configuration\n\n1. Ensure you have the `google-services.json` file in your `android/app` directory.\n2. Update your `android/build.gradle` file to include the Google services classpath:\n\n```groovy\nbuildscript {\n    dependencies {\n        // Add this line\n        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10'\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3. In your `android/app/build.gradle`, apply the Google services plugin:\n\n```groovy\napply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'\n```\n\n### iOS Configuration\n\n1. Place the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in your `ios/Runner` directory.\n2. Ensure your `ios/Podfile` has the platform set to at least 10.0:\n\n```ruby\nplatform :ios, '10.0'\n```\n\n3. Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory to install the necessary dependencies.\n\n## Step 3: Implement Localization\n\nIn your `main.dart` file, you will need to set up the localization delegates and supported locales.\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';\nimport 'package:firebase_ui_localizations/firebase_ui_localizations.dart';\n\nvoid main() async {\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n  await Firebase.initializeApp();\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Firebase UI Localizations Demo',\n      localizationsDelegates: [\n        FirebaseUILocalizations.delegate,\n        GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,\n        GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,\n        GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,\n      ],\n      supportedLocales: [\n        const Locale('en', ''), // English\n        const Locale('es', ''), // Spanish\n        // Add other supported locales here\n      ],\n      home: RealFlutter(),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis setup ensures that your app can support multiple languages and utilize the localization features provided by the `firebase_ui_localizations` package.",

    "tutorial": "# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Easy_Mask\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the easy_mask package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.\n\n## Step 1: Adding the Dependency\n\nTo get started, add the easy_mask package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  easy_mask: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev\n```\n\nAfter adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:\n\n```bash\nflutter pub get\n```\n\n## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration\n\n### Android Configuration\n\nFor Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:\n\n```groovy\nandroid {\n    ...\n    defaultConfig {\n        ...\n        minSdkVersion 21\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### iOS Configuration\n\nFor iOS, you may need to update your `Info.plist` file to allow for certain permissions, depending on your app's requirements. However, for basic usage of easy_mask, no specific configurations are required.\n\n## Step 3: Using Easy_Mask in Your Application\n\nNow that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in a Flutter widget. Below is an example of how to implement an input mask for a phone number.\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:easy_mask/easy_mask.dart';\n\nclass RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      home: Scaffold(\n        appBar: AppBar(\n          title: Text('Easy Mask Example'),\n        ),\n        body: Padding(\n          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),\n          child: Column(\n            children: [\n              TextField(\n                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Phone Number'),\n                keyboardType: TextInputType.phone,\n                inputFormatters: [\n                  MaskedTextInputFormatter(\n                    mask: '(##) #####-####',\n                    separator: '#',\n                  ),\n                ],\n              ),\n            ],\n          ),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(RealFlutter());\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a text field for entering a phone number. The input mask ensures that the user enters the number in the format `(XX) XXXXX-XXXX`.",
    "main": "```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:easy_mask/easy_mask.dart';\n\nclass RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      home: Scaffold(\n        appBar: AppBar(\n          title: Text('Easy Mask Example'),\n        ),\n        body: Padding(\n          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),\n          child: Column(\n            children: [\n              // TextField for Phone Number with Mask\n              TextField(\n                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Phone Number'),\n                keyboardType: TextInputType.phone,\n                inputFormatters: [\n                  // Applying the MaskedTextInputFormatter\n                  MaskedTextInputFormatter(\n                    mask: '(##) #####-####', // Mask format\n                    separator: '#', // Character used for masking\n                  ),\n                ],\n              ),\n              SizedBox(height: 20), // Space between fields\n              // TextField for Date with Mask\n              TextField(\n                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Date (DD/MM/YYYY)'),\n                keyboardType: TextInputType.datetime,\n                inputFormatters: [\n                  // Applying the MaskedTextInputFormatter for date\n                  MaskedTextInputFormatter(\n                    mask: '##/##/####', // Mask format for date\n                    separator: '/', // Character used for masking\n                  ),\n                ],\n              ),\n            ],\n          ),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(RealFlutter());\n}\n\n// Application Flow Explanation:\n// 1. The app starts with the main function, which calls runApp() to launch the RealFlutter widget.\n// 2. The RealFlutter widget builds a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.\n// 3. The body consists of a Column with two TextFields:\n//    - The first TextField is for entering a phone number, with a mask applied to format the input as (XX) XXXXX-XXXX.\n//    - The second TextField is for entering a date, with a mask applied to format the input as DD/MM/YYYY.\n// 4. The MaskedTextInputFormatter is used to enforce the input format, providing a better user experience by guiding the user on how to enter the data correctly.\n```"

Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  adaptive_action_sheet: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev\n```\n\nAfter adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.\n\n## Step 2: Importing the Package\n\nIn your Dart file, import the package:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:adaptive_action_sheet/adaptive_action_sheet.dart';\n```\n\n## Step 3: Using the Adaptive Action Sheet\n\nYou can use the `showAdaptiveActionSheet` function to display the action sheet. Here’s how to do it:\n\n### Example Code\n\n```dart\nvoid _showActionSheet(BuildContext context) {\n  showAdaptiveActionSheet(\n    context: context,\n    title: Text('Choose an option'),\n    actions: <ActionSheetAction>[\n      ActionSheetAction(\n        title: Text('Option 1'),\n        onPressed: () {\n          // Handle Option 1\n          Navigator.pop(context);\n        },\n      ),\n      ActionSheetAction(\n        title: Text('Option 2'),\n        onPressed: () {\n          // Handle Option 2\n          Navigator.pop(context);\n        },\n      ),\n      ActionSheetAction(\n        title: Text('Cancel'),\n        isDestructiveAction: true,\n        onPressed: () {\n          // Handle Cancel\n          Navigator.pop(context);\n        },\n      ),\n    ],\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Platform-Specific Details\n\n- **Android**: The action sheet will appear as a bottom sheet, which is the standard behavior for Android applications.\n- **iOS**: The action sheet will appear as a modal dialog, consistent with iOS design guidelines.\n\n## Step 4: Testing the Action Sheet\n\nRun your application on both Android and iOS devices or emulators to see the adaptive action sheet in action. Ensure that the appearance and behavior are as expected on both platforms.\n\n### Additional Configurations\n\nFor iOS, you may want to ensure that your app's Info.plist file includes any necessary permissions or configurations, especially if your actions involve accessing device features.\n\nThat's it! You have successfully integrated the `adaptive_action_sheet` package into your Flutter application.",

The main function runs the app by calling runApp() with the RealFlutter widget.\n// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body.\n// 3. The body contains a SliderWidget, which is a stateful widget.\n// 4. SliderWidget maintains the current value of the slider in its state.\n// 5. The build method of SliderWidget displays the current value and the AnotherSlider widget.\n// 6. When the slider is moved, the onChanged callback updates the current value and rebuilds the widget to reflect the change.\n```"

    "tutorial": "# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Animator Package\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_animator` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.\n\n## Step 1: Adding the Dependency\n\nTo get started, you need to add the `flutter_animator` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  flutter_animator: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev\n```\n\nAfter adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:\n\n```bash\nflutter pub get\n```\n\n## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations\n\n### Android\n\nFor Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:\n\n```groovy\nandroid {\n    ...\n    defaultConfig {\n        ...\n        minSdkVersion 21\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### iOS\n\nFor iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Flutter:\n\n```ruby\nplatform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher\n```\n\n## Step 3: Importing the Package\n\nIn your Dart file, import the `flutter_animator` package:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter_animator/flutter_animator.dart';\n```\n\n## Step 4: Using the Package\n\nYou can now use the animations provided by the package. Here’s a simple example of how to use the `RealFlutter` class to create an animated button.\n\n```dart\n// Example of using flutter_animator in a widget\nclass RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Animator Example')),\n      body: Center(\n        child: Animator(\n          duration: Duration(seconds: 1),\n          cycles: 0, // Infinite loop\n          tween: Tween<double>(begin: 0.0, end: 1.0),\n          builder: (context, animatorState, child) => Opacity(\n            opacity: animatorState.value,\n            child: ElevatedButton(\n              onPressed: () {},\n              child: Text('Click Me!'),\n            ),\n          ),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a button that fades in and out using the `Animator` widget. The `tween` property defines the animation from 0.0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque).\n\nWith these steps, you are now ready to use the `flutter_animator` package in your Flutter applications!",
    "main": "```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter_animator/flutter_animator.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Flutter Animator Demo',\n      theme: ThemeData(\n        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,\n      ),\n      home: RealFlutter(),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter Animator Example')),\n      body: Center(\n        // Using the Animator widget to create a fade-in effect\n        child: Animator(\n          duration: Duration(seconds: 1), // Duration of the animation\n          cycles: 0, // Infinite loop\n          tween: Tween<double>(begin: 0.0, end: 1.0), // Tween for opacity\n          builder: (context, animatorState, child) => Opacity(\n            opacity: animatorState.value, // Set the opacity based on animation state\n            child: ElevatedButton(\n              onPressed: () {\n                // Action when button is pressed\n                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(\n                  SnackBar(content: Text('Button Pressed!')),\n                );\n              },\n              child: Text('Click Me!'), // Button text\n            ),\n          ),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// Application Flow Explanation:\n// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with MyApp.\n// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.\n// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.\n// 4. Inside the Center, an Animator widget is used to create a fade-in effect for the button.\n// 5. The button's opacity is controlled by the animatorState.value, which changes over the duration of the animation.\n// 6. When the button is pressed, a SnackBar is displayed to inform the user that the button was pressed.\n```"

Make sure to enable the following:\n\n- Enable \"Test\" under the \"Build Settings\" for your target.\n\n## Step 3: Writing Tests\n\nNow that you have set up the package, you can start writing tests. Here’s a simple example of how to use the **convenient_test** package to test a Flutter widget.\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';\nimport 'package:convenient_test/convenient_test.dart';\nimport 'package:your_app/main.dart'; // Import your main app file\n\nvoid main() {\n  testWidgets('MyWidget has a title and message', (WidgetTester tester) async {\n    // Build our app and trigger a frame.\n    await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp());\n\n    // Verify that our widget displays a title and message.\n    expect(find.text('Welcome'), findsOneWidget);\n    expect(find.text('Hello, World!'), findsOneWidget);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, we are testing a widget to ensure it displays the correct title and message. The **convenient_test** package simplifies the process of writing this test.",
    "main": "```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:convenient_test/convenient_test.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(RealFlutter());\n}\n\nclass RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Convenient Test Example',\n      home: Scaffold(\n        appBar: AppBar(\n          title: Text('Convenient Test Example'),\n        ),\n        body: Center(\n          child: Column(\n            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n            children: <Widget>[\n              Text('Welcome'),\n              Text('Hello, World!'),\n            ],\n          ),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// Application Flow Explanation:\n// 1. The main function is the entry point of the application.\n// 2. The runApp function initializes the app and takes the RealFlutter widget as an argument.\n// 3. The RealFlutter widget is a StatelessWidget that builds the main UI of the app.\n// 4. Inside the build method, a MaterialApp is created with a title and a Scaffold.\n// 5. The Scaffold contains an AppBar with the title and a Center widget that centers its child widgets.\n// 6. The body of the Center widget contains a Column that displays two Text widgets: \"Welcome\" and \"Hello, World!\".\n// 7. This simple structure allows us to test the UI components using the convenient_test package.\n```"

    "description": "# Overview of the `dart_frog_auth` Flutter Package\n\nThe `dart_frog_auth` package is a powerful authentication solution designed for Flutter applications. It provides a seamless way to integrate authentication mechanisms into your app, supporting various authentication methods such as email/password, social logins, and more. This package is particularly useful for developers looking to implement secure user authentication without having to build everything from scratch.\n\n## When to Use `dart_frog_auth`\n\nYou should consider using `dart_frog_auth` in scenarios such as:\n- Building applications that require user registration and login functionalities.\n- Implementing social authentication (e.g., Google, Facebook) in your Flutter app.\n- Creating a secure environment for user data and interactions.\n\n## Key Features\n- **Multiple Authentication Methods**: Supports email/password, social logins, and custom authentication.\n- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process with clear documentation.\n- **Secure**: Built with security best practices in mind to protect user data.\n- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.\n\nWith these features, `dart_frog_auth` simplifies the authentication process, allowing developers to focus on building their applications rather than dealing with the complexities of user authentication.",
    "tutorial": "# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `dart_frog_auth`\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `dart_frog_auth` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.\n\n## Step 1: Adding the Dependency\n\nTo get started, add the `dart_frog_auth` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  dart_frog_auth: ^latest_version\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).\n\n## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration\n\n### Android Configuration\n\n1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure you have the following configurations:\n\n```groovy\nandroid {\n    ...\n    defaultConfig {\n        ...\n        minSdkVersion 21 // Ensure this is set to at least 21\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Add the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"/>\n```\n\n### iOS Configuration\n\n1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:\n\n```xml\n<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n```\n\nThis allows your app to make network requests.\n\n## Step 3: Initializing the Package\n\nIn your main Dart file, initialize the `dart_frog_auth` package:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:dart_frog_auth/dart_frog_auth.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Dart Frog Auth Demo',\n      home: AuthHome(),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Step 4: Using the Authentication Features\n\nYou can now use the authentication features provided by the package. Here’s a simple example of how to implement email/password authentication:\n\n```dart\nclass AuthHome extends StatefulWidget {\n  @override\n  _AuthHomeState createState() => _AuthHomeState();\n}\n\nclass _AuthHomeState extends State<AuthHome> {\n  final TextEditingController _emailController = TextEditingController();\n  final TextEditingController _passwordController = TextEditingController();\n  String _message = '';\n\n  void _login() async {\n    try {\n      await RealFlutter.login(\n        email: _emailController.text,\n        password: _passwordController.text,\n      );\n      setState(() {\n        _message = 'Login successful!';\n      });\n    } catch (e) {\n      setState(() {\n        _message = 'Login failed: $e';\n      });\n    }\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dart Frog Auth')),\n      body: Padding(\n        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),\n        child: Column(\n          children: [\n            TextField(\n              controller: _emailController,\n              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),\n            ),\n            TextField(\n              controller: _passwordController,\n              decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Password'),\n              obscureText: true,\n            ),\n            ElevatedButton(\n              onPressed: _login,\n              child: Text('Login'),\n            ),\n            Text(_message),\n          ],\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a simple login form that allows users to enter their email and password. When the login button is pressed, the `_login` method is called, which attempts to log the user in using the `RealFlutter.login` method.",

Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:\n\n```groovy\nandroid {\n    ...\n    defaultConfig {\n        ...\n        minSdkVersion 21\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Step 3: Configure for iOS\n\nFor iOS, you need to make some additional configurations:\n\n1. Open `Info.plist` located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.\n2. Add the following entries to allow network access:\n\n```xml\n<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n```\n\n3. Ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 11.0 in `ios/Podfile`:\n\n```ruby\nplatform :ios, '11.0'\n```\n\n## Step 4: Initialize the Package\n\nIn your main Dart file, import the package and initialize it:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:moyasar/moyasar.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n```\n\n## Step 5: Using the Package\n\nYou can now use the Moyasar package to initiate a payment. Here’s a simple example of how to do this:\n\n```dart\nvoid initiatePayment() async {\n  final payment = await Moyasar.startPayment(\n    amount: 1000, // Amount in the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents)\n    currency: 'SAR', // Currency code\n    description: 'Payment for Order #1234',\n    onSuccess: (response) {\n      // Handle successful payment\n      print('Payment successful: $response');\n    },\n    onFailure: (error) {\n      // Handle payment failure\n      print('Payment failed: $error');\n    },\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThis function initiates a payment and handles both success and failure scenarios.\n\nWith these steps, you should be able to integrate the Moyasar Flutter package into your application successfully.",
    "main": "```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:moyasar/moyasar.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Moyasar Payment Example',\n      home: PaymentScreen(),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {\n  // Function to initiate payment\n  void initiatePayment(BuildContext context) async {\n    // Start the payment process\n    final payment = await Moyasar.startPayment(\n      amount: 1000, // Amount in the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents)\n      currency: 'SAR', // Currency code\n      description: 'Payment for Order #1234',\n      onSuccess: (response) {\n        // Handle successful payment\n        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(\n          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment successful: $response')),\n        );\n      },\n      onFailure: (error) {\n        // Handle payment failure\n        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(\n          SnackBar(content: Text('Payment failed: $error')),\n        );\n      },\n    );\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(\n        title: Text('Moyasar Payment Example'),\n      ),\n      body: Center(\n        child: ElevatedButton(\n          onPressed: () => initiatePayment(context), // Trigger payment on button press\n          child: Text('Pay Now'),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// Application Flow Explanation:\n// 1.

    "main": "```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:syncfusion_localizations/syncfusion_localizations.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Syncfusion Localizations Demo',\n      localizationsDelegates: [\n        GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,\n        GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,\n        GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,\n        SfLocalizations.delegate, // Syncfusion localization delegate\n      ],\n      supportedLocales: [\n        const Locale('en', ''), // English\n        const Locale('es', ''), // Spanish\n        const Locale('fr', ''), // French\n      ],\n      home: RealFlutter(),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(\n        title: Text(SfLocalizations.of(context).getString('appBarTitle')),\n      ),\n      body: Center(\n        child: Column(\n          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n          children: <Widget>[\n            Text(SfLocalizations.of(context).getString('welcomeMessage')),\n            SizedBox(height: 20),\n            ElevatedButton(\n              onPressed: () {\n                // Action for button press\n              },\n              child: Text(SfLocalizations.of(context).getString('buttonLabel')),\n            ),\n          ],\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// Application Flow Explanation:\n// 1. The main function initializes the app by calling runApp with MyApp.\n// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with localization delegates and supported locales.\n// 3. The home property of MaterialApp is set to RealFlutter, which is the main screen of the app.\n// 4. In RealFlutter, the AppBar displays a localized title using SfLocalizations.\n// 5. The body contains a welcome message and a button, both of which are localized.\n// 6. When the button is pressed, it can trigger any action defined in the onPressed callback.\n```"

It is designed to create unique identifiers that are shorter than UUIDs, making them more efficient for use in URLs and databases. The package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to generate unique keys for database entries, session identifiers, or any other use case where a unique string is required.\n\n## When to Use Nanoid\n\n- **Database Keys**: When you need unique identifiers for database records.\n- **Session Management**: For generating session tokens that are secure and unique.\n- **URL Shortening**: When creating short, unique URLs for web applications.\n- **Random Identifiers**: For any application that requires random unique strings.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Compact Size**: Generates shorter IDs compared to traditional UUIDs.\n- **Customizable Length**: You can specify the length of the generated ID.\n- **Secure**: Uses cryptographic randomness to ensure uniqueness.\n- **URL-Friendly**: The generated IDs are safe to use in URLs.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nTo use the nanoid package, you can simply import it into your Flutter project and start generating unique IDs. Here’s a quick example:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:nanoid/nanoid.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  // Generate a unique ID with default length\n  String id = nanoid();\n  print('Generated ID: $id');\n}\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how easy it is to generate a unique ID using the nanoid package. You can customize the length of the ID by passing an integer to the `nanoid` function, like so: `nanoid(10)` for a 10-character ID.",
    "tutorial": "# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Nanoid Package\n\n## Step 1: Add Dependency\n\nTo get started with the nanoid package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  nanoid: ^3.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev\n```\n\nAfter adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.\n\n## Step 2: Import the Package\n\nIn your Dart file, import the nanoid package:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:nanoid/nanoid.dart';\n```\n\n## Step 3: Generate Unique IDs\n\nYou can now use the `nanoid` function to generate unique IDs. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```dart\nString id = nanoid(); // Generates a unique ID with default length\nString customId = nanoid(10); // Generates a unique ID with a length of 10\n```\n\n### Platform-Specific Details\n\n- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file to avoid compatibility issues.\n  \n  ```gradle\n  android {\n      ...\n      defaultConfig {\n          ...\n          minSdkVersion 21\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS. Just ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed.\n\n## Step 4: Optimizations\n\nFor better performance, especially in applications that require generating a large number of IDs, consider caching the generated IDs or using a pool of pre-generated IDs.\n\n### Example of Caching\n\n```dart\nList<String> idCache = List.generate(100, (_) => nanoid());\n```\n\nThis will generate and cache 100 unique IDs that can be reused throughout your application.\n\nWith these steps, you are now ready to use the nanoid package in your Flutter applications!",

    "description": "# intl_translation Flutter Package\n\nThe `intl_translation` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement internationalization (i18n) in their applications. It provides a way to manage translations and localizations efficiently, allowing developers to create apps that cater to a global audience.\n\n## When to Use `intl_translation`\n\nYou should consider using the `intl_translation` package when:\n- You want to support multiple languages in your Flutter application.\n- You need to manage translations for various UI strings, messages, and other text elements.\n- You are looking for a way to automate the extraction and generation of localization files.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Automatic Extraction**: The package can automatically extract strings from your Dart code that need translation.\n- **Support for Multiple Languages**: Easily manage translations for different languages using `.arb` files.\n- **Integration with Flutter's Intl Package**: Works seamlessly with the `intl` package, which provides the necessary tools for internationalization.\n- **Command-Line Tools**: Includes command-line tools to help with the generation of localization files.\n\nBy leveraging the `intl_translation` package, developers can ensure that their applications are accessible to users around the world, enhancing user experience and engagement.",
    "tutorial": "# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `intl_translation`\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `intl_translation` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.\n\n## Step 1: Add Dependencies\n\nFirst, add the `intl_translation` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  intl: ^0.17.0\n  intl_translation: ^0.17.0\n```\n\nThen, run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependencies.\n\n## Step 2: Create ARB Files\n\nCreate a directory named `lib/l10n` in your Flutter project. Inside this directory, create your localization files. For example, create `intl_en.arb` for English and `intl_es.arb` for Spanish.\n\n### Example of `intl_en.arb`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"@@locale\": \"en\",\n  \"hello\": \"Hello\",\n  \"welcome\": \"Welcome to our application!\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example of `intl_es.arb`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"@@locale\": \"es\",\n  \"hello\": \"Hola\",\n  \"welcome\": \"¡Bienvenido a nuestra aplicación!\"\n}\n```\n\n## Step 3: Extract Translations\n\nUse the command line to extract the strings that need translation. Run the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nflutter pub run intl_translation:extract_to_arb --output-dir=lib/l10n lib/*.dart\n```\n\nThis command will generate a new file named `intl_messages.arb` containing all the strings marked for translation.\n\n## Step 4: Generate Dart Localization Files\n\nNext, generate the Dart localization files from your ARB files:\n\n```bash\nflutter pub run intl_translation:generate_from_arb --output-dir=lib/l10n --no-use-deferred-loading lib/*.dart lib/l10n/intl_*.arb\n```\n\n## Step 5: Update Your Flutter App\n\nIn your `main.dart` file, update the app to use the generated localization files. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:intl/intl.dart';\nimport 'l10n/messages_all.dart';\n\nclass RealFlutter {\n  static Future<void> initializeMessages(String localeName) async {\n    await initializeMessages(localeName);\n  }\n\n  static String get hello => Intl.message('Hello', name: 'hello');\n  static String get welcome => Intl.message('Welcome to our application!', name: 'welcome');\n}\n\nvoid main() async {\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n  await RealFlutter.initializeMessages('en'); // Initialize with default locale\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Intl Translation Example',\n      home: Scaffold(\n        appBar: AppBar(\n          title: Text(RealFlutter.welcome),\n        ),\n        body: Center(\n          child: Text(RealFlutter.hello),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Platform-Specific Details\n\n- **Android**: Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the correct configurations for localization.\n- **iOS**: Make sure to enable localization in your Xcode project settings.\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully set up and use the `intl_translation` package in your Flutter application.",
    "main": "```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:intl/intl.dart';\nimport 'l10n/messages_all.dart';\n\nclass RealFlutter {\n  // This method initializes the messages for the specified locale\n  static Future<void> initializeMessages(String localeName) async {\n    await initializeMessages(localeName);\n  }\n\n  // Getter for the 'hello' message\n  static String get hello => Intl.message('Hello', name: 'hello');\n\n  // Getter for the 'welcome' message\n  static String get welcome => Intl.message('Welcome to our application!', name: 'welcome');\n}\n\nvoid main() async {\n  // Ensure that Flutter bindings are initialized\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n\n  // Initialize messages for the default locale (English)\n  await RealFlutter.initializeMessages('en');\n\n  // Run the Flutter application\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Intl Translation Example',\n      home: Scaffold(\n        appBar: AppBar(\n          title: Text(RealFlutter.welcome), // Display the welcome message\n        ),\n        body: Center(\n          child: Text(RealFlutter.hello), // Display the hello message\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// Application Flow Explanation:\n// 1. The main function starts the application and ensures that Flutter is ready to run.\n// 2. It initializes the localization messages for the default locale (English).\n// 3. The MyApp widget is created, which builds the MaterialApp.\n// 4. The AppBar displays the welcome message retrieved from the RealFlutter class.\n// 5. The body of the Scaffold contains a centered Text widget that displays the hello message.\n// 6. The application is now ready to support multiple languages by adding more ARB files and updating the localization logic.\n```"

    "description": "# Streaming Shared Preferences in Flutter\n\nThe `streaming_shared_preferences` package is a powerful tool for managing shared preferences in Flutter applications. Unlike the traditional `shared_preferences` package, which provides a synchronous API, `streaming_shared_preferences` offers a reactive approach, allowing developers to listen for changes in preferences and update the UI accordingly. This is particularly useful in applications where user preferences can change frequently and need to be reflected in real-time.\n\n## When to Use This Package\n\nYou should consider using `streaming_shared_preferences` in scenarios such as:\n\n- **Real-time Settings Updates**: When your app has settings that can change while the app is running, such as theme changes, notification preferences, or user profiles.\n- **Reactive UI**: If you want your UI to automatically update when preferences change without needing to manually refresh the state.\n- **Complex Data Management**: When you need to manage multiple preferences and want a more structured way to handle them.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Reactive API**: Listen to changes in preferences and update the UI automatically.\n- **Asynchronous Operations**: Load preferences asynchronously, improving performance and responsiveness.\n- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.\n- **Type Safety**: Provides a type-safe way to manage preferences, reducing runtime errors.\n\nWith these features, `streaming_shared_preferences` enhances the way developers handle user preferences in Flutter applications, making it a valuable addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit.",
    "tutorial": "# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Streaming Shared Preferences\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `streaming_shared_preferences` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.\n\n## Step 1: Adding the Dependency\n\nTo get started, add the `streaming_shared_preferences` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  streaming_shared_preferences: ^2.0.0\n```\n\nMake sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the package.\n\n## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration\n\n### Android\n\nFor Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:\n\n```groovy\nandroid {\n    ...\n    defaultConfig {\n        ...\n        minSdkVersion 21\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### iOS\n\nFor iOS, you may need to add the following to your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:\n\n```ruby\nplatform :ios, '10.0'\n```\n\n## Step 3: Initializing the Package\n\nIn your main Dart file, you need to initialize the `StreamingSharedPreferences` instance. This is typically done in the `main()` function.\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:streaming_shared_preferences/streaming_shared_preferences.dart';\n\nvoid main() async {\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n  // Initialize the StreamingSharedPreferences instance\n  final preferences = await StreamingSharedPreferences.instance;\n  runApp(MyApp(preferences: preferences));\n}\n```\n\n## Step 4: Using the Package\n\nYou can now use the `StreamingSharedPreferences` instance to read and write preferences. Here’s a simple example of how to toggle a theme preference:\n\n```dart\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  final StreamingSharedPreferences preferences;\n\n  MyApp({required this.preferences});\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    // Get the theme preference\n    final themePreference = preferences.getBool('isDarkTheme', defaultValue: false);\n\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Streaming Shared Preferences Demo',\n      theme: themePreference.getValue() ? ThemeData.dark() : ThemeData.light(),\n      home: HomeScreen(preferences: preferences),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {\n  final StreamingSharedPreferences preferences;\n\n  HomeScreen({required this.preferences});\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    // Listen for changes in the theme preference\n    final themePreference = preferences.getBool('isDarkTheme', defaultValue: false);\n\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Streaming Shared Preferences')),\n      body: Center(\n        child: StreamBuilder<bool>(\n          stream: themePreference.asStream(),\n          builder: (context, snapshot) {\n            return Column(\n              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n              children: [\n                Text('Current Theme: ${snapshot.data == true ? \"Dark\" : \"Light\"}'),\n                Switch(\n                  value: snapshot.data ?? false,\n                  onChanged: (value) {\n                    // Update the theme preference\n                    themePreference.setValue(value);\n                  },\n                ),\n              ],\n            );\n          },\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```",

The controller is initialized, and once ready, the UI is updated to show the video player.\n// 5. **Dispose Method**: The controller is disposed of in the `dispose` method to free up resources when the widget is removed from the tree.\n// 6. **Building the UI**: In the `build` method, if the controller is initialized, the video player and a play/pause button are displayed. If not initialized, a loading indicator is shown.\n// 7. **Play/Pause Functionality**: The play/pause button toggles the video playback state when pressed.\n\nOverall, this example illustrates how to set up and use the `cached_video_player` package in a Flutter application, providing a smooth video playback experience with caching capabilities.\n```"
