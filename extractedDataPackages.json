Open the file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:\n\n```yml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  ffmpeg_wasm: ^0.1.0\n```\n\nThen, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.\n\n## Step 2: Import the Package\n---------------------------\n\nTo use the package, you need to import it in your Dart file. Add the following line at the top of your file:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:ffmpeg_wasm/ffmpeg_wasm.dart';\n```\n\n## Step 3: Initialize the FFmpeg Instance\n-----------------------------------------\n\nBefore you can use the FFmpeg instance, you need to initialize it. You can do this by calling the `FFmpeg.init()` method:\n\n```dart\nawait FFmpeg.init();\n```\n\n## Step 4: Use the FFmpeg Instance\n-------------------------------\n\nNow you can use the FFmpeg instance to perform various multimedia processing tasks. For example, you can use the `FFmpeg.ffmpeg()` method to execute an FFmpeg command:\n\n```dart\nawait FFmpeg.ffmpeg(\n  '-i', 'input.mp4', '-c:v', 'libx264', '-crf', '18', 'output.mp4',\n);\n```\n\nThis command takes an input file `input.mp4`, encodes it using the H.264 codec, and saves the output to a file named `output.mp4`.\n\n## Platform-Specific Details\n---------------------------\n\nThe `ffmpeg_wasm` package uses WebAssembly (WASM) to run the FFmpeg instance in the browser. This means that it only works on platforms that support WASM, such as web browsers.\n\nIf you need to use the package on other platforms, such as mobile or desktop, you will need to use a different approach.\n\n## Configurations and Optimizations\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe `ffmpeg_wasm` package provides several configurations and optimizations that you can use to customize its behavior. For example, you can use the `FFmpeg.setLogLevel()` method to set the log level:\n\n```dart\nFFmpeg.setLogLevel(LogLevel.verbose);\n```\n\nYou can also use the `FFmpeg.setThreads()` method to set the number of threads:\n\n```dart\nFFmpeg.setThreads(4);\n```",

    "description": "# Redux Persist Flutter Package\n================================\n\nThe `redux_persist_flutter` package provides a simple way to persist and rehydrate a Redux state tree in Flutter. It uses the `redux_persist` package under the hood to handle the serialization and deserialization of the state tree.\n\n## When to Use\n--------------\n\nThis package is useful when you want to persist the state of your app even after the user closes it. This can be useful for storing user preferences, cached data, or any other state that you want to retain between app sessions.\n\n## Features\n------------\n\n*   Supports both Android and iOS platforms\n*   Uses the `redux_persist` package for serialization and deserialization\n*   Provides a simple API for persisting and rehydrating the state tree",
    "tutorial": "# Tutorial\n==========\n\n## Setup\n--------\n\nTo use the `redux_persist_flutter` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  redux_persist_flutter: ^0.9.0\n```\n\nThen, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.\n\n## Usage\n-----\n\nTo use the package, you need to create a `Persistor` instance and pass it to the `Store` constructor:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:redux/redux.dart';\nimport 'package:redux_persist/redux_persist.dart';\nimport 'package:redux_persist_flutter/redux_persist_flutter.dart';\n\nvoid main() async {\n  final persistor = Persistor<RealFlutter>(\n    storage: FlutterStorage(),\n    serializer: JsonSerializer<RealFlutter>(),\n  );\n\n  final initialState = await persistor.load();\n\n  final store = Store<RealFlutter>(\n    reducer,\n    initialState: initialState ?? RealFlutter(),\n    middleware: [persistor.createMiddleware()],\n  );\n\n  runApp(MyApp(store: store));\n}\n```\n\nIn the above code, we create a `Persistor` instance with the `FlutterStorage` and `JsonSerializer`. We then load the initial state from the persistor and create a `Store` instance with the loaded state and the persistor middleware.\n\n## Platform-Specific Details\n---------------------------\n\nThe `redux_persist_flutter` package uses the `path_provider` package to determine the storage directory. On Android, it uses the `getExternalStorageDirectory` method, while on iOS, it uses the `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory` method.\n\nYou can customize the storage directory by passing a custom `storage` instance to the `Persistor` constructor.\n\n## Configurations and Optimizations\n-----------------------------------\n\nYou can configure the `redux_persist_flutter` package by passing a custom `serializer` instance to the `Persistor` constructor. For example, you can use the `JsonSerializer` with a custom `json` converter:\n\n```dart\nfinal serializer = JsonSerializer<RealFlutter>(\n  jsonConverter: (json) => RealFlutter.fromJson(json),\n);\n```\n\nYou can also optimize the persistence process by using a custom `middleware` instance. For example, you can use the `thunkMiddleware` to persist the state only when the app is in the background:\n\n```dart\nfinal middleware = thunkMiddleware<RealFlutter>((store, action, next) {\n  if (action is PersistAction) {\n    store.dispatch(action);\n  } else {\n    next(action);\n  }\n});\n```",

You can do this by adding the following line to the `dependencies` section of your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yml\ndependencies:\n  numerus: ^1.0.0\n```\n\nAfter adding the Numerus package to your `pubspec.yaml` file, you can import it into your Dart files using the following import statement:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:numerus/numerus.dart';\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\nTo use Numerus to format a number, you can create a new instance of the `Numerus` class and call the `format` method. Here is an example of how to use Numerus to format a number:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:numerus/numerus.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  final numerus = Numerus();\n  final formattedNumber = numerus.format(12345.67);\n  print(formattedNumber);\n}\n```\n\n## Customizing the Format\nYou can customize the format of the number by passing a `NumerusFormat` object to the `format` method. Here is an example of how to customize the format:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:numerus/numerus.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  final numerus = Numerus();\n  final format = NumerusFormat(\n    locale: 'en_US',\n    currency: 'USD',\n    decimalPlaces: 2,\n  );\n  final formattedNumber = numerus.format(12345.67, format: format);\n  print(formattedNumber);\n}\n```\n\n## Platform-Specific Details\nNumerus uses the `intl` package under the hood to handle locale-specific formatting. This means that Numerus will work correctly on both Android and iOS devices, as long as the `intl` package is correctly configured.\n\nTo configure the `intl` package, you will need to add the following lines to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yml\ndependencies:\n  intl: ^0.17.0\n```\n\nYou will also need to import the `intl` package into your Dart files using the following import statement:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:intl/intl.dart';\n```",
