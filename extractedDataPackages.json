    "description": "# Retrofit Flutter Package: An Overview\n\nThe `retrofit` package in Flutter is a powerful HTTP client generator that leverages the capabilities of the `Dio` library to simplify API interactions. It is particularly useful for developers who want to create a type-safe HTTP client with minimal boilerplate code. By using annotations, `retrofit` generates the necessary code to handle network requests, making it easier to manage and maintain.\n\n## When to Use Retrofit\n\n- **Type Safety**: If you need a type-safe way to handle HTTP requests and responses.\n- **Code Generation**: When you want to reduce boilerplate code associated with network operations.\n- **Integration with Dio**: If you are already using the `Dio` package for HTTP requests, `retrofit` seamlessly integrates with it.\n- **RESTful APIs**: Ideal for applications that interact with RESTful APIs, providing a clean and organized way to manage endpoints.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Annotations**: Use annotations to define HTTP methods, endpoints, and request parameters.\n- **Code Generation**: Automatically generates the necessary code for making HTTP requests.\n- **Error Handling**: Provides mechanisms for handling errors and exceptions.\n- **Customization**: Offers flexibility to customize requests with headers, query parameters, and more.",
    "tutorial": "# Setting Up Retrofit in Flutter\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `retrofit` package in a Flutter project. We will cover the necessary configurations for both Android and iOS platforms.\n\n## Step 1: Add Dependencies\n\nFirst, add the `retrofit` and `dio` packages to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  dio: ^5.0.0\n  retrofit: ^4.0.0\n\ndev_dependencies:\n  retrofit_generator: ^4.0.0\n  build_runner: ^2.0.0\n```\n\n## Step 2: Create a RealFlutter Class\n\nCreate a Dart file, `real_flutter.dart`, and define the `RealFlutter` class with the necessary annotations:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:retrofit/retrofit.dart';\nimport 'package:dio/dio.dart';\n\npart 'real_flutter.g.dart';\n\n@RestApi(baseUrl: \"https://api.example.com\")\nabstract class RealFlutter {\n  factory RealFlutter(Dio dio, {String baseUrl}) = _RealFlutter;\n\n  @GET(\"/users\")\n  Future<List<User>> getUsers();\n\n  @GET(\"/users/{id}\")\n  Future<User> getUser(@Path(\"id\") int id);\n\n  @POST(\"/users\")\n  Future<User> createUser(@Body() User user);\n}\n```\n\n## Step 3: Generate the Retrofit Client\n\nRun the following command to generate the Retrofit client:\n\n```bash\nflutter pub run build_runner build\n```\n\nThis command will generate a `real_flutter.g.dart` file containing the implementation of the `RealFlutter` class.\n\n## Step 4: Platform-Specific Configurations\n\n### Android\n\nEnsure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary internet permissions:\n\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"/>\n```\n\n### iOS\n\nFor iOS, make sure your `Info.plist` file allows HTTP requests by adding the following:\n\n```xml\n<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>\n<dict>\n  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>\n  <true/>\n</dict>\n```\n\n## Step 5: Using the Retrofit Client\n\nYou can now use the `RealFlutter` class to make HTTP requests in your Flutter application.",

    "description": "# Overview of the `blurhash_dart` Flutter Package\n\nThe `blurhash_dart` package is a Flutter implementation of the BlurHash algorithm, which allows developers to create a placeholder for images that are being loaded. This is particularly useful in applications where images may take time to load, providing a smooth user experience by displaying a blurred version of the image instead of a blank space.\n\n## When to Use `blurhash_dart`\n\n- **Image Loading**: When displaying images from the network, you can use BlurHash to show a blurred placeholder while the actual image is being fetched.\n- **Performance Optimization**: It helps in reducing the perceived loading time of images, enhancing the overall user experience.\n- **Aesthetic Appeal**: The blurred placeholders can be visually appealing and can maintain the layout of your application while images are loading.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Easy Integration**: Simple to add to your Flutter project.\n- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.\n- **Customizable**: You can adjust the size and quality of the generated blurhash.\n\nIn summary, `blurhash_dart` is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to improve the user experience of their applications by providing smooth image loading experiences.",
    "tutorial": "# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `blurhash_dart`\n\n## Step 1: Adding the Dependency\n\nTo get started with `blurhash_dart`, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  blurhash_dart: ^0.6.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev\n```\n\n## Step 2: Running Flutter Packages Get\n\nAfter adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install the package:\n\n```bash\nflutter pub get\n```\n\n## Step 3: Platform-Specific Configuration\n\n### Android\n\nFor Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:\n\n```gradle\nandroid {\n    ...\n    defaultConfig {\n        ...\n        minSdkVersion 21\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### iOS\n\nFor iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility:\n\n```ruby\nplatform :ios, '10.0'\n```\n\n## Step 4: Using the Package\n\nYou can now use the `blurhash_dart` package in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to implement it:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:blurhash_dart/blurhash_dart.dart';\n\nclass RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      home: Scaffold(\n        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('BlurHash Example')),\n        body: Center(\n          child: BlurHash(\n            hash: 'LEHV6nWB2yk8pyo0adR*.7kCMdnj', // Example hash\n            image: 'https://example.com/image.jpg', // Actual image URL\n            imageFit: BoxFit.cover,\n            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),\n          ),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `BlurHash` widget takes a `hash` and an `image` URL. The `hash` is a string representation of the blurred image, while the `image` is the actual image that will be displayed once it is loaded.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYou are now ready to use the `blurhash_dart` package in your Flutter applications. This package will help you create a better user experience by providing smooth image loading with blurred placeholders.",

A `Scaffold` widget is used to create the app's visual structure, including an AppBar and a body.\n// 4. In the body, a `Center` widget is used to center the `BlurHash` widget.\n// 5. The `BlurHash` widget takes a `hash` string that represents the blurred image and an `image` URL for the actual image.\n// 6. The `imageFit` property is set to `BoxFit.cover` to ensure the image covers the entire widget area.\n// 7. The `duration` property is set to 500 milliseconds, which controls how long it takes for the image to fade in once loaded.\n// 8. When the app runs, the blurred placeholder will be displayed first, and once the actual image is loaded, it will fade in smoothly.\n```"

    "tutorial": "# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `amplify_storage_s3`\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `amplify_storage_s3` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.\n\n## Step 1: Add Dependencies\n\nFirst, you need to add the necessary dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  amplify_flutter: ^0.2.0\n  amplify_storage_s3: ^0.2.0\n```\n\n## Step 2: Configure Amplify\n\nBefore using the `amplify_storage_s3` package, you need to configure Amplify in your Flutter application. This involves setting up the Amplify configuration file.\n\n1. **Create an Amplify Project**: Use the Amplify CLI to create a new project and add the storage category.\n\n   ```bash\n   amplify init\n   amplify add storage\n   ```\n\n2. **Configure Storage**: Follow the prompts to configure your S3 bucket.\n\n3. **Generate Configuration File**: After configuring, run the following command to generate the `amplifyconfiguration.json` file.\n\n   ```bash\n   amplify push\n   ```\n\n4. **Add Configuration to Flutter**: Place the `amplifyconfiguration.json` file in the `assets` directory of your Flutter project and ensure it is included in your `pubspec.yaml`:\n\n   ```yaml\n   flutter:\n     assets:\n       - assets/amplifyconfiguration.json\n   ```\n\n## Step 3: Initialize Amplify in Your App\n\nIn your main Dart file, initialize Amplify and add the storage plugin:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:amplify_flutter/amplify.dart';\nimport 'package:amplify_storage_s3/amplify_storage_s3.dart';\nimport 'amplifyconfiguration.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Amplify Storage S3 Demo',\n      home: HomeScreen(),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {\n  @override\n  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();\n}\n\nclass _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {\n  @override\n  void initState() {\n    super.initState();\n    _configureAmplify();\n  }\n\n  Future<void> _configureAmplify() async {\n    try {\n      await Amplify.addPlugin(AmplifyStorageS3());\n      await Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);\n      print('Successfully configured Amplify');\n    } catch (e) {\n      print('Could not configure Amplify: $e');\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Additional methods for file upload/download will go here\n}\n```\n\n## Step 4: Platform-Specific Configuration\n\n### Android\n\n1. **Update AndroidManifest.xml**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\n   ```xml\n   <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"/>\n   ```\n\n2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure your `build.gradle` files are set up correctly to include the necessary dependencies.\n\n### iOS\n\n1. **Update Info.plist**: Add the following permissions to your `Info.plist`:\n\n   ```xml\n   <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>\n   <string>We need access to your photo library to upload files.</string>\n   ```\n\n2. **CocoaPods**: Ensure you run `pod install` in the `ios` directory after adding dependencies.\n\n## Step 5: Using the Package\n\nYou can now use the `amplify_storage_s3` package to upload and download files. Here’s a simple example of how to upload a file:\n\n```dart\nFuture<void> uploadFile(String filePath) async {\n  try {\n    final result = await Amplify.Storage.uploadFile(\n      local: File(filePath),\n      key: 'myFile.txt',\n    );\n    print('File uploaded: ${result.key}');\n  } catch (e) {\n    print('Error uploading file: $e');\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can similarly implement the download functionality using `Amplify.Storage.downloadFile`.\n\nWith these steps, you should be able to set up and use the `amplify_storage_s3` package in your Flutter application effectively.",

    "description": "# Local Session Timeout Flutter Package\n\nThe `local_session_timeout` package is a Flutter library designed to manage user sessions effectively by implementing a timeout mechanism. This package is particularly useful in applications where user security and session management are critical, such as banking apps, social media platforms, and any application that handles sensitive user data.\n\n## When to Use This Package\n\nYou should consider using the `local_session_timeout` package in scenarios such as:\n\n- **Security-Sensitive Applications**: When your app deals with sensitive information, it's essential to log users out after a period of inactivity.\n- **User Experience**: To enhance user experience by preventing unauthorized access to the app when the user is away.\n- **Compliance**: To comply with regulations that require session management and timeout policies.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Customizable Timeout Duration**: Set the duration for session timeout according to your application's needs.\n- **Automatic Logout**: Automatically logs out users after the specified timeout period.\n- **Session Reset**: Resets the session timer on user activity, ensuring that active users remain logged in.\n- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.\n\nBy leveraging this package, developers can ensure that their applications maintain a high level of security while providing a smooth user experience.",
    "tutorial": "# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Local Session Timeout Package\n\n## Step 1: Adding the Dependency\n\nTo get started, add the `local_session_timeout` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  local_session_timeout: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev\n```\n\n## Step 2: Importing the Package\n\nIn your Dart file, import the package:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:local_session_timeout/local_session_timeout.dart';\n```\n\n## Step 3: Initializing the Package\n\nYou need to initialize the session timeout in your main application file. This is typically done in the `initState` method of your main widget.\n\n### Android Configuration\n\nFor Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` has the necessary permissions if you are using features that require them. However, the `local_session_timeout` package does not require any special permissions.\n\n### iOS Configuration\n\nFor iOS, ensure that your app's `Info.plist` file is configured correctly. Again, the `local_session_timeout` package does not require any specific configurations.\n\n## Step 4: Using the Package\n\nYou can use the package by creating an instance of `LocalSessionTimeout` and setting the timeout duration. Here’s a basic example:\n\n```dart\nLocalSessionTimeout sessionTimeout = LocalSessionTimeout(\n  timeoutDuration: Duration(minutes: 5), // Set timeout duration\n  onTimeout: () {\n    // Handle timeout, e.g., navigate to login screen\n    print(\"Session timed out!\");\n  },\n);\n```\n\n## Step 5: Resetting the Session\n\nTo reset the session timeout on user activity, you can call the `resetSession` method whenever the user interacts with the app:\n\n```dart\nsessionTimeout.resetSession();\n```\n\nThis method should be called in response to user actions, such as button presses or screen taps.\n\nWith these steps, you can effectively manage user sessions in your Flutter application using the `local_session_timeout` package.",
    "main": "```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:local_session_timeout/local_session_timeout.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatefulWidget {\n  @override\n  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();\n}\n\nclass _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {\n  // Create an instance of LocalSessionTimeout\n  LocalSessionTimeout sessionTimeout;\n\n  @override\n  void initState() {\n    super.initState();\n    // Initialize the session timeout with a duration of 5 minutes\n    sessionTimeout = LocalSessionTimeout(\n      timeoutDuration: Duration(minutes: 5),\n      onTimeout: () {\n        // Handle session timeout\n        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(\n          MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => LoginScreen()),\n        );\n      },\n    );\n    // Start the session timeout\n    sessionTimeout.startSession();\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      home: Scaffold(\n        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Local Session Timeout Example')),\n        body: GestureDetector(\n          onTap: () {\n            // Reset the session timeout on user interaction\n            sessionTimeout.resetSession();\n          },\n          child: Center(\n            child: Text('Tap anywhere to reset session timeout.'),\n          ),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n\n  @override\n  void dispose() {\n    // Dispose of the session timeout when the app is closed\n    sessionTimeout.dispose();\n    super.dispose();\n  }\n}\n\nclass LoginScreen extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Login')),\n      body: Center(child: Text('Session has timed out. Please log in again.')),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Application Flow Explanation\n\n// The application starts with the `MyApp` widget, which initializes the `LocalSessionTimeout` instance.\n// The timeout duration is set to 5 minutes, and the `onTimeout` callback navigates to the `LoginScreen` when the session times out.\n// The `GestureDetector` widget wraps the main content, allowing the app to reset the session timeout whenever the user taps anywhere on the screen.\n// The `resetSession` method is called on user interaction, ensuring that active users remain logged in.\n// When the app is disposed of, the session timeout is also disposed of to free up resources.\n// If the session times out, the user is redirected to the `LoginScreen`, prompting them to log in again.\n\n```"

    "main": "```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:widget_to_marker/widget_to_marker.dart';\n\nclass RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    // Step 1: Create a widget to use as a marker\n    final markerWidget = Container(\n      padding: EdgeInsets.all(8),\n      decoration: BoxDecoration(\n        color: Colors.blue,\n        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),\n      ),\n      child: Text(\n        'Marker',\n        style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),\n      ),\n    );\n\n    // Step 2: Convert the widget to a marker\n    final marker = WidgetToMarker.convert(markerWidget);\n\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Widget to Marker Example')),\n      body: Center(\n        child: marker, // Step 3: Display the marker\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MaterialApp(\n    home: RealFlutter(),\n  ));\n}\n\n// Application Flow Explanation:\n// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.\n// 2. In the RealFlutter widget, we create a custom marker widget using a Container with padding and a blue background.\n// 3. We convert this widget into a marker using the WidgetToMarker.convert method.\n// 4. Finally, we display the marker in the center of the screen within a Scaffold.\n// 5. This setup allows for easy customization of the marker's appearance and behavior.\n```"

The app starts with the RealFlutter class, which is a StatelessWidget.\n// 2. The MaterialApp widget is created, providing the basic structure of the app.\n// 3. A Scaffold widget is used to create the app's layout, including an AppBar and a body.\n// 4. The ImagePainter widget is instantiated in the body, where you can specify the image to be painted on, brush color, and size.\n// 5. The user can interact with the canvas to draw on the image, and the undo/redo functionality allows them to manage their actions easily.\n```\n\n// The application flow is straightforward: it initializes a Flutter app with a drawing canvas where users can paint on a specified image. The `ImagePainter` widget handles all the drawing logic, allowing users to customize their experience with brush color and size. The app is structured to provide a seamless user experience, making it easy to create interactive image editing applications.\n```"

    "description": "# Kiwi Flutter Package\n\nThe **Kiwi** package is a powerful dependency injection (DI) framework for Flutter applications. It allows developers to manage the lifecycle of their objects and dependencies in a clean and efficient manner. By using Kiwi, you can easily register and resolve dependencies, making your code more modular and testable.\n\n## When to Use Kiwi\n\n- **Complex Applications**: When your application has multiple layers and components that depend on each other, Kiwi helps manage these dependencies effectively.\n- **Testing**: Kiwi makes it easier to mock dependencies during unit testing, allowing for more isolated tests.\n- **Modular Architecture**: If you're following a modular architecture pattern, Kiwi can help you manage dependencies across different modules.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Simple API**: Kiwi provides a straightforward API for registering and resolving dependencies.\n- **Scoped Instances**: You can create scoped instances that are only available within a specific context.\n- **Lazy Loading**: Kiwi supports lazy loading of dependencies, which can improve performance by only creating instances when needed.\n- **Singleton Support**: Easily manage singleton instances to ensure that only one instance of a class is created throughout the application.",
    "tutorial": "# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using Kiwi\n\n## Step 1: Adding Dependency\n\nTo use the Kiwi package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  kiwi: ^2.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev\n```\n\nRun `flutter pub get` to install the package.\n\n## Step 2: Basic Setup\n\n### Importing Kiwi\n\nIn your Dart files, import the Kiwi package:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:kiwi/kiwi.dart';\n```\n\n### Creating a Service\n\nCreate a service class that you want to manage with Kiwi:\n\n```dart\nclass ApiService {\n  String fetchData() {\n    return \"Data fetched from API\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Registering the Service\n\nYou need to register your service with Kiwi. This is typically done in the main function or a dedicated setup function:\n\n```dart\nvoid setup() {\n  final container = KiwiContainer();\n  container.registerSingleton((c) => ApiService());\n}\n```\n\n### Resolving the Service\n\nTo use the registered service, you can resolve it from the container:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  setup();\n  final apiService = KiwiContainer().resolve<ApiService>();\n  print(apiService.fetchData());\n}\n```\n\n## Platform-Specific Details\n\n### Android\n\nFor Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:\n\n```groovy\nandroid {\n    ...\n    defaultConfig {\n        ...\n        minSdkVersion 21\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### iOS\n\nFor iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:\n\n```ruby\nplatform :ios, '10.0'\n```\n\n## Optimizations\n\n- **Lazy Loading**: Use lazy loading for services that are not always needed to improve performance.\n- **Scoped Instances**: Use scoped instances for services that should only exist within a specific context, such as a screen or feature.",

    "description": "# Overview of the `state_notifier` Flutter Package\n\nThe `state_notifier` package is a powerful state management solution for Flutter applications. It provides a simple and effective way to manage state in a reactive manner, allowing developers to build applications that are both responsive and maintainable. The package is built on top of the `ChangeNotifier` class, offering a more structured approach to state management.\n\n## When to Use `state_notifier`\n\nYou should consider using the `state_notifier` package when:\n- You need a clear separation of business logic from UI code.\n- You want to manage complex states in your application.\n- You are looking for a solution that scales well with your app's growth.\n- You prefer a more functional approach to state management.\n\n## Key Features\n- **Immutable State**: Encourages the use of immutable state, making it easier to track changes and debug.\n- **Notifiers**: Allows you to create multiple notifiers for different parts of your application, promoting modularity.\n- **Integration with Flutter**: Works seamlessly with Flutter's widget tree, ensuring that your UI updates efficiently when the state changes.\n- **Testing**: Simplifies testing by allowing you to mock state notifiers easily.\n\nIn summary, the `state_notifier` package is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to implement a robust state management solution that is easy to use and maintain.",
    "tutorial": "# Setting Up and Using the `state_notifier` Package\n\n## Step 1: Add Dependency\n\nTo get started, you need to add the `state_notifier` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  state_notifier: ^0.7.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev\n```\n\n## Step 2: Create Your State Class\n\nCreate a state class that extends `StateNotifier`. This class will manage the state of your application. For example:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:state_notifier/state_notifier.dart';\n\nclass RealFlutterState extends StateNotifier<int> {\n  RealFlutterState() : super(0); // Initial state is 0\n\n  void increment() {\n    state++; // Increment the state\n  }\n\n  void decrement() {\n    state--; // Decrement the state\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Step 3: Provide the StateNotifier\n\nYou can use the `Provider` package to provide your `StateNotifier` to the widget tree. Wrap your application with a `Provider`:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:provider/provider.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(\n    Provider(\n      create: (_) => RealFlutterState(),\n      child: MyApp(),\n    ),\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Step 4: Consume the State in Your Widgets\n\nTo consume the state in your widgets, use the `Consumer` widget from the `provider` package:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:provider/provider.dart';\n\nclass MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    final state = context.watch<RealFlutterState>();\n\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('State Notifier Example')),\n      body: Center(\n        child: Text('Current Count: ${state.state}'),\n      ),\n      floatingActionButton: Column(\n        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.end,\n        children: [\n          FloatingActionButton(\n            onPressed: () => context.read<RealFlutterState>().increment(),\n            tooltip: 'Increment',\n            child: Icon(Icons.add),\n          ),\n          SizedBox(height: 10),\n          FloatingActionButton(\n            onPressed: () => context.read<RealFlutterState>().decrement(),\n            tooltip: 'Decrement',\n            child: Icon(Icons.remove),\n          ),\n        ],\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Platform-Specific Details\n\n### Android\nEnsure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:\n\n```gradle\nandroid {\n    ...\n    defaultConfig {\n        ...\n        minSdkVersion 21\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### iOS\nFor iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:\n\n```ruby\nplatform :ios, '10.0'\n```\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThe `state_notifier` package provides a clean and efficient way to manage state in Flutter applications. By following the steps above, you can easily integrate it into your projects and take advantage of its powerful features.",

    "tutorial": "# Setting Up flutter_map_animations: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_map_animations` package and demonstrate how to use it effectively in your Flutter application.\n\n## Step 1: Add Dependencies\n\nTo get started, you need to add the `flutter_map` and `flutter_map_animations` packages to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following lines:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  flutter_map: ^0.14.0\n  flutter_map_animations: ^0.2.0\n```\n\nMake sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependencies.\n\n## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configurations\n\n### Android\n\nFor Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions for internet access, as the map will require it to fetch tiles. Add the following lines inside the `<manifest>` tag:\n\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"/>\n```\n\n### iOS\n\nFor iOS, you may need to add permissions in your `Info.plist` file to allow for location services if your app uses user location. Add the following lines:\n\n```xml\n<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>\n<string>We need your location to show it on the map.</string>\n<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>\n<string>We need your location to show it on the map.</string>\n```\n\n## Step 3: Basic Usage\n\nNow that we have set up the package, let's create a simple map with animations. Below is a basic example of how to implement the `flutter_map_animations` package in your Flutter application.\n\n1. Import the necessary packages in your Dart file:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter_map/flutter_map.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter_map_animations/flutter_map_animations.dart';\nimport 'package:latlong2/latlong.dart';\n```\n\n2. Create a `RealFlutter` class that extends `StatelessWidget` or `StatefulWidget` depending on your needs.\n\n3. Use the `AnimatedMapController` to control the animations on the map.\n\nThis setup will allow you to create a dynamic and interactive map experience in your Flutter application.",

Here’s a simple example:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:tap_debouncer/tap_debouncer.dart';\n\nclass RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Tap Debouncer Example')),\n      body: Center(\n        child: TapDebouncer(\n          onTap: () {\n            // Action to perform on tap\n            print('Button tapped!');\n          },\n          debounceDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Customize debounce duration\n          child: ElevatedButton(\n            onPressed: null, // Disable default onPressed\n            child: Text('Tap Me'),\n          ),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Platform-Specific Details\n\n#### Android\n\nFor Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:\n\n```gradle\nandroid {\n    ...\n    defaultConfig {\n        ...\n        minSdkVersion 21\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### iOS\n\nFor iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to at least 10.0 in your `ios/Podfile`:\n\n```ruby\nplatform :ios, '10.0'\n```\n\n## Step 3: Optimizations\n\n- **Debounce Duration**: Adjust the `debounceDuration` based on your application's needs. A shorter duration may be suitable for quick actions, while a longer duration can help prevent accidental taps in critical actions.\n- **User Feedback**: Consider providing visual feedback (like disabling the button) when a tap is registered to enhance user experience.\n\nWith these steps, you can effectively integrate the `tap_debouncer` package into your Flutter application.",
    "main": "```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:tap_debouncer/tap_debouncer.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Tap Debouncer Demo',\n      theme: ThemeData(\n        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,\n      ),\n      home: RealFlutter(),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Tap Debouncer Example')),\n      body: Center(\n        child: TapDebouncer(\n          onTap: () {\n            // Action to perform on tap\n            print('Button tapped!'); // Log the tap action\n          },\n          debounceDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), // Set debounce duration\n          child: ElevatedButton(\n            onPressed: null, // Disable default onPressed\n            child: Text('Tap Me'), // Button label\n          ),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// Application Flow Explanation:\n// 1. The main function initializes the Flutter app by calling runApp() with MyApp.\n// 2. MyApp sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme, and specifies RealFlutter as the home widget.\n// 3. RealFlutter builds a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.\n// 4. Inside the Center, a TapDebouncer wraps an ElevatedButton.\n// 5. When the button is tapped, the onTap callback is triggered, logging 'Button tapped!' to the console.\n// 6. The debounceDuration of 500 milliseconds prevents multiple taps from triggering the action too quickly.\n// 7. The button's onPressed is set to null to disable the default behavior, relying solely on the TapDebouncer for tap handling.\n```"

Create this file in the root of your project and add the following configuration:\n\n```yaml\n# dartdoc_options.yaml\noutput: doc/api\ninclude: lib/**\nexclude: test/**\n```\n\nThis configuration specifies that the generated documentation will be placed in the `doc/api` directory, including all files in the `lib` directory and excluding the `test` directory.\n\n## Step 3: Generating Documentation\n\nTo generate the documentation, run the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\ndartdoc\n```\n\nThis command will parse your Dart files and generate the documentation based on the configuration specified in `dartdoc_options.yaml`. The output will be available in the `doc/api` directory.\n\n## Platform-Specific Details\n\n### Android\n\nFor Android, ensure that your project is set up correctly with the necessary permissions and configurations in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. However, `dartdoc` does not require any specific configurations for Android.\n\n### iOS\n\nSimilarly, for iOS, ensure that your project is configured correctly in the `Info.plist` file. Again, `dartdoc` does not require any specific configurations for iOS.\n\n## Step 4: Viewing the Documentation\n\nOnce the documentation is generated, you can view it by opening the `index.html` file located in the `doc/api` directory in your web browser. This will display the generated documentation, complete with links and navigation.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively set up and use the `dartdoc` package in your Flutter projects, ensuring that your code is well-documented and easy to understand.",

The `main` function is the entry point of the application, where the `RealFlutter` widget is run.\n// 2. The `RealFlutter` class is a stateless widget that sets up the MaterialApp with a title and theme.\n// 3. The `MyHomePage` widget is defined, which contains a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Center widget.\n// 4. Inside the Center widget, an ElevatedButton is created. When pressed, it shows a dialog with a message.\n// 5. The dialog can be closed by pressing the 'Close' button, which uses the Navigator to pop the dialog off the stack.\n// \n// This example illustrates how to create a simple Flutter application and how to document it using the dartdoc package.

    "description": "# Progressive Image Flutter Package\n\nThe `progressive_image` Flutter package is designed to enhance the user experience by loading images progressively. This means that instead of waiting for a high-resolution image to load completely, users can see a lower-resolution version first, which improves perceived performance and provides a smoother experience, especially on slower networks.\n\n## When to Use\n\nYou should consider using the `progressive_image` package in scenarios such as:\n- **Image-heavy applications**: Apps that display a lot of images, like galleries or social media platforms, can benefit from progressive loading.\n- **Slow network conditions**: In areas with poor connectivity, showing a low-resolution image first can keep users engaged while the high-resolution image loads.\n- **User experience enhancement**: Any application where user experience is a priority can leverage this package to provide a more responsive interface.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Progressive Loading**: Load images in stages, starting with a low-resolution version and progressively enhancing to a high-resolution version.\n- **Caching**: Efficiently caches images to reduce loading times on subsequent views.\n- **Customizable**: Allows customization of the loading indicators and error handling.\n\nOverall, the `progressive_image` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to improve image loading performance and user experience.",

Once initialized, it updates the state to reflect that the camera is ready.\n// 5. **Capture Image**: The `_captureImage()` method captures an image when the button is pressed. It displays the captured image in a dialog.\n// 6. **Dispose**: The `dispose()` method ensures that the camera controller is properly disposed of when the widget is removed from the widget tree.\n// 7. **Build Method**: The `build()` method constructs the UI, showing a camera preview and a button to capture images. If the camera is not initialized, a loading indicator is displayed.\n\n```"

    "description": "# Description\n\nThe `diffutil_dart` package is a powerful utility for managing lists in Flutter applications. It provides a way to efficiently calculate the differences between two lists and update the UI accordingly. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you have large datasets and want to minimize the performance overhead associated with rebuilding the entire list when only a few items have changed.\n\n## When to Use\n\nYou should consider using `diffutil_dart` in the following scenarios:\n\n- **Dynamic Lists**: When your application displays lists that frequently change, such as chat messages, notifications, or any data that updates in real-time.\n- **Performance Optimization**: If you notice performance issues when updating lists, especially with large datasets, this package can help optimize the rendering process.\n- **Complex Data Structures**: When dealing with complex data structures where you need to track changes in nested lists or objects.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Efficient Diff Calculation**: The package uses an efficient algorithm to calculate the differences between two lists, minimizing the number of updates required.\n- **Custom Equality Check**: You can define custom equality checks for your data models, allowing for more precise diff calculations.\n- **Easy Integration**: The package is easy to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.",
    "tutorial": "# Tutorial\n\n## Setup Process\n\nTo get started with the `diffutil_dart` package, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `diffutil_dart` package under dependencies:\n\n   ```yaml\n   dependencies:\n     flutter:\n       sdk: flutter\n     diffutil_dart: ^1.0.0\n   ```\n\n2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package:\n\n   ```bash\n   flutter pub get\n   ```\n\n3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:\n   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.\n   - **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure you have the latest version of Xcode.\n\n## Using the Package\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n1. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package:\n\n   ```dart\n   import 'package:diffutil_dart/diffutil_dart.dart';\n   ```\n\n2. **Define Your Data Model**: Create a data model that you will use in your list. For example:\n\n   ```dart\n   class Item {\n     final String id;\n     final String name;\n\n     Item(this.id, this.name);\n\n     // Override equality for diff calculation\n     @override\n     bool operator ==(Object other) =>\n         identical(this, other) ||\n         other is Item && runtimeType == other.runtimeType && id == other.id;\n\n     @override\n     int get hashCode => id.hashCode;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Implement DiffUtil**: Use the `DiffUtil` class to calculate the differences between two lists:\n\n   ```dart\n   List<Item> oldList = [...]; // Your old list\n   List<Item> newList = [...]; // Your new list\n\n   final diffResult = DiffUtil.calculateDiff(\n     DiffUtilCallback(oldList, newList),\n   );\n\n   // Update your UI with the diff result\n   ```\n\n4. **Create a DiffUtilCallback**: Implement a callback class that extends `DiffUtil.Callback` to define how to compare items:\n\n   ```dart\n   class DiffUtilCallback extends DiffUtil.Callback<Item> {\n     final List<Item> oldList;\n     final List<Item> newList;\n\n     DiffUtilCallback(this.oldList, this.newList);\n\n     @override\n     int get oldListSize => oldList.length;\n\n     @override\n     int get newListSize => newList.length;\n\n     @override\n     bool areItemsTheSame(int oldItemPosition, int newItemPosition) {\n       return oldList[oldItemPosition].id == newList[newItemPosition].id;\n     }\n\n     @override\n     bool areContentsTheSame(int oldItemPosition, int newItemPosition) {\n       return oldList[oldItemPosition] == newList[newItemPosition];\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Optimizations\n\n- **Batch Updates**: When updating the list, consider batching updates to minimize UI redraws.\n- **Use Keys**: If your list items are complex, consider using `ValueKey` or `ObjectKey` to help Flutter identify which items have changed.",
    "main": "```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:diffutil_dart/diffutil_dart.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'DiffUtil Example',\n      home: RealFlutter(),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {\n  @override\n  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();\n}\n\nclass _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> {\n  List<Item> items = [\n    Item('1', 'Item 1'),\n    Item('2', 'Item 2'),\n    Item('3', 'Item 3'),\n  ];\n\n  void updateItems() {\n    // New list with some changes\n    List<Item> newItems = [\n      Item('1', 'Item 1'),\n      Item('2', 'Updated Item 2'), // Updated item\n      Item('4', 'Item 4'), // New item\n    ];\n\n    // Calculate the diff\n    final diffResult = DiffUtil.calculateDiff(\n      DiffUtilCallback(items, newItems),\n    );\n\n    // Update the state with the new items\n    setState(() {\n      items = newItems;\n    });\n\n    // Notify the UI about the changes\n    diffResult.dispatchUpdatesTo(_itemAdapter);\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(\n        title: Text('DiffUtil Example'),\n      ),\n      body: ListView.builder(\n        itemCount: items.length,\n        itemBuilder: (context, index) {\n          return ListTile(\n            title: Text(items[index].name),\n          );\n        },\n      ),\n      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(\n        onPressed: updateItems,\n        child: Icon(Icons.update),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// Explanation of the application flow:\n// 1. The app starts with the MyApp widget, which sets up the MaterialApp.\n// 2. The RealFlutter widget is the main screen that displays a list of items.\n// 3. The items list is initialized with three items.\n// 4. When the floating action button is pressed, the updateItems method is called.\n// 5. This method creates a new list with some updated and new items.\n// 6. The DiffUtil.calculateDiff method is called to compute the differences between the old and new lists.\n// 7. The state is updated with the new items, and the UI is notified of the changes.\n// 8. The ListView.builder rebuilds the list based on the updated items.\n```\n\n// Final Summary:\n// The application initializes with a list of items displayed in a ListView. When the floating action button is pressed, it simulates an update to the list by creating a new list with some changes. The `DiffUtil` package calculates the differences between the old and new lists, allowing for efficient updates to the UI. The ListView is then rebuilt with the updated items, demonstrating how to use the `diffutil_dart` package effectively in a Flutter application.\n```"

    "description": "# dio_cache_interceptor_hive_store Flutter Package\n\nThe `dio_cache_interceptor_hive_store` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers looking to implement caching mechanisms in their applications. Built on top of the Dio HTTP client, this package allows for efficient caching of HTTP responses using Hive as the storage solution. This is particularly useful for applications that require offline capabilities or want to reduce network calls for frequently accessed data.\n\n## When to Use This Package\n\nYou should consider using the `dio_cache_interceptor_hive_store` package in scenarios such as:\n\n- **Offline Support**: When your application needs to function without an internet connection, caching responses can provide users with access to previously fetched data.\n- **Performance Optimization**: Reducing the number of network requests can significantly improve the performance of your application, especially for data that doesn't change frequently.\n- **Data Synchronization**: When you need to synchronize data between the server and the client, caching can help manage the data flow more efficiently.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Dio Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the Dio HTTP client, allowing for easy configuration and use.\n- **Hive Storage**: Utilizes Hive for fast and efficient local storage of cached data.\n- **Customizable Cache Policies**: Offers options to customize cache expiration, cache keys, and more.\n- **Automatic Cache Management**: Automatically handles cache retrieval and storage, simplifying the developer's workload.",
    "tutorial": "# Tutorial: Setting Up dio_cache_interceptor_hive_store\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `dio_cache_interceptor_hive_store` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.\n\n## Step 1: Add Dependencies\n\nFirst, add the necessary dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  dio: ^5.0.0\n  dio_cache_interceptor_hive_store: ^1.0.0\n  hive: ^2.0.0\n  hive_flutter: ^1.0.0\n```\n\nMake sure to run `flutter pub get` to install the packages.\n\n## Step 2: Initialize Hive\n\nBefore using Hive, you need to initialize it. This is typically done in the `main` function of your application. Here’s how to do it:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:hive/hive.dart';\nimport 'package:hive_flutter/hive_flutter.dart';\n\nvoid main() async {\n  await Hive.initFlutter(); // Initialize Hive\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n```\n\n## Step 3: Configure Dio with Cache Interceptor\n\nNext, you need to set up Dio with the cache interceptor. Here’s how to do it:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:dio/dio.dart';\nimport 'package:dio_cache_interceptor_hive_store/dio_cache_interceptor_hive_store.dart';\n\nclass RealFlutter {\n  final Dio dio;\n\n  RealFlutter() : dio = Dio() {\n    // Set up the cache interceptor\n    final cacheStore = HiveCacheStore('cacheBox'); // Create a cache store\n    dio.interceptors.add(DioCacheInterceptor(\n      store: cacheStore,\n      defaultPolicy: CachePolicy.forceCache, // Set default cache policy\n    ));\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Step 4: Making Requests\n\nYou can now make HTTP requests using the configured Dio instance. Here’s an example of how to fetch data:\n\n```dart\nFuture<void> fetchData() async {\n  try {\n    final response = await dio.get('https://api.example.com/data');\n    print(response.data); // Handle the response data\n  } catch (e) {\n    print('Error fetching data: $e');\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Platform-Specific Details\n\n### Android\n\nFor Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"/>\n```\n\n### iOS\n\nFor iOS, you may need to add the following to your `Info.plist` to allow network requests:\n\n```xml\n<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>\n<dict>\n  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>\n  <true/>\n</dict>\n```\n\n## Step 5: Running the Application\n\nNow that everything is set up, you can run your application. The caching mechanism will automatically handle storing and retrieving data based on your configuration.",

The application starts and initializes Hive for local storage.\n// 2. The MyApp widget is built, which contains the HomeScreen.\n// 3. In the HomeScreen's state, Dio is configured with the cache interceptor.\n// 4. When the HomeScreen initializes, it calls fetchData() to retrieve data from the API.\n// 5. The fetched data is printed to the console, and the UI is updated accordingly.\n```"

The package automatically handles the underlying storage mechanism for both Android and iOS.\n\n```dart\nfinal db = Localstore.instance;\n```\n\n## Step 4: Using Localstore\n\n### Storing Data\n\nYou can store data using the `set` method. Here’s an example of how to store user preferences:\n\n```dart\nvoid saveUserPreference(String key, dynamic value) {\n  db.collection('preferences').doc(key).set({'value': value});\n}\n```\n\n### Retrieving Data\n\nTo retrieve data, use the `get` method:\n\n```dart\nFuture<dynamic> getUserPreference(String key) async {\n  final doc = await db.collection('preferences').doc(key).get();\n  return doc?['value'];\n}\n```\n\n### Deleting Data\n\nTo delete a specific entry, use the `delete` method:\n\n```dart\nvoid deleteUserPreference(String key) {\n  db.collection('preferences').doc(key).delete();\n}\n```\n\n## Platform-Specific Details\n\n### Android\n\nFor Android, ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if you plan to access external storage. However, localstore primarily uses internal storage, which does not require special permissions.\n\n### iOS\n\nFor iOS, ensure that your app has the appropriate entitlements if you are using features that require them. Localstore works out of the box without additional configuration.\n\n## Optimizations\n\n- **Batch Operations**: If you need to store multiple items, consider using batch operations to improve performance.\n- **Data Structure**: Use appropriate data structures for your stored data to optimize retrieval times.",

    "description": "# Flutter CORS Package: Overview\n\nThe `flutter_cors` package is a powerful tool designed to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Flutter applications. CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent malicious websites from accessing resources from another domain without permission. This package simplifies the process of making HTTP requests to servers that require CORS headers, allowing developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about CORS-related issues.\n\n## When to Use `flutter_cors`\n\nYou should consider using the `flutter_cors` package in scenarios such as:\n\n- **API Integration**: When your Flutter app needs to communicate with a RESTful API hosted on a different domain.\n- **Web Applications**: If you're building a web application using Flutter and need to handle CORS for various resources.\n- **Development and Testing**: During development, when you want to bypass CORS restrictions for testing purposes.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Easy Integration**: Simple to add to your Flutter project with minimal configuration.\n- **Customizable Headers**: Allows you to specify custom headers for your requests.\n- **Support for Multiple Platforms**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.\n\nBy leveraging the `flutter_cors` package, developers can ensure that their applications can communicate effectively with external APIs while adhering to security protocols.",
    "tutorial": "# Flutter CORS Package: Setup and Usage Tutorial\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `flutter_cors` package and demonstrate how to use it in your Flutter application.\n\n## Step 1: Adding the Dependency\n\nTo get started, add the `flutter_cors` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  flutter_cors: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev\n```\n\nRun `flutter pub get` to install the package.\n\n## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration\n\n### Android\n\nFor Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file includes the necessary permissions for internet access:\n\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"/>\n```\n\n### iOS\n\nFor iOS, you may need to configure your `Info.plist` to allow arbitrary loads if you're testing with non-secure HTTP requests:\n\n```xml\n<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n```\n\n## Step 3: Using the Package\n\nNow that we have set up the package, let's see how to use it in our Flutter application. The `flutter_cors` package provides a simple API to make HTTP requests while handling CORS.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nHere’s a basic example of how to use the `flutter_cors` package to make a GET request:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter_cors/flutter_cors.dart';\n\nclass RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      home: Scaffold(\n        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Flutter CORS Example')),\n        body: Center(\n          child: ElevatedButton(\n            onPressed: () async {\n              // Making a GET request using flutter_cors\n              final response = await Cors.get(\n                'https://api.example.com/data',\n                headers: {\n                  'Authorization': 'Bearer your_token_here',\n                },\n              );\n\n              // Handle the response\n              if (response.statusCode == 200) {\n                print('Data: ${response.body}');\n              } else {\n                print('Error: ${response.statusCode}');\n              }\n            },\n            child: Text('Fetch Data'),\n          ),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a simple Flutter application with a button that fetches data from an external API when pressed. The `Cors.get` method is used to make the GET request, and we can specify custom headers as needed.",

This package is particularly useful for applications that need to store files locally, such as images, documents, or any other data that should persist between app launches.\n\n## When to Use This Package\n\nYou should consider using the `android_path_provider` package when:\n- You need to store files locally on the device.\n- You want to access specific directories like the temporary directory or application documents directory.\n- You are developing applications that require file management, such as image galleries, document viewers, or any app that handles user-generated content.\n\n## Features\n- Access to various file system directories.\n- Cross-platform support for both Android and iOS.\n- Simple API for retrieving paths.",
    "tutorial": "# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Android Path Provider\n\n## Step 1: Adding the Dependency\n\nTo use the `android_path_provider` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  path_provider: ^2.0.11  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev\n```\n\n## Step 2: Importing the Package\n\nIn your Dart file, import the package:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';\nimport 'dart:io'; // Required for File operations\n```\n\n## Step 3: Accessing Directories\n\nYou can access different directories using the methods provided by the package. Here’s how to do it for both Android and iOS:\n\n### For Android\n- **Temporary Directory**: Use `getTemporaryDirectory()` to get a temporary directory for storing files that can be deleted when the app is closed.\n- **Application Documents Directory**: Use `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` to get a directory for storing files that should persist between app launches.\n\n### For iOS\n- The same methods can be used, and they will return the appropriate directories for iOS.\n\n## Step 4: Example Usage\n\nHere’s a simple example of how to use the `android_path_provider` package to create a file in the application documents directory:\n\n```dart\nFuture<void> createFile() async {\n  // Get the application documents directory\n  final directory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();\n  \n  // Create a new file in the directory\n  final file = File('${directory.path}/example.txt');\n  \n  // Write some content to the file\n  await file.writeAsString('Hello, Flutter!');\n}\n```\n\n## Step 5: Permissions (Android)\n\nFor Android, if you are accessing external storage, you may need to request permissions. Make sure to add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\"/>\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\"/>\n```\n\nFor Android 6.0 (API level 23) and above, you will also need to request these permissions at runtime.\n\n## Step 6: Testing\n\nRun your application on an Android or iOS device to test the functionality.

This package is particularly useful for applications that require real-time updates on phone state changes, such as call management apps, messaging apps, or any application that needs to respond to telephony events.\n\n## When to Use This Package\n\nYou might consider using the `phone_state` package in scenarios such as:\n- **Call Management Applications**: To track incoming, outgoing, and missed calls.\n- **Messaging Applications**: To determine if the user is on a call before sending a message.\n- **Telephony Services**: To provide features like call blocking or call forwarding.\n\n## Key Features\n- **Real-time Call State Monitoring**: Listen for changes in call state (idle, ringing, off-hook).\n- **Access to Phone Number**: Retrieve the phone number of the device (with appropriate permissions).\n- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS with minimal configuration.\n\nThe `phone_state` package is a great addition to any Flutter developer's toolkit, especially for those looking to integrate telephony features into their applications.",
    "tutorial": "# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the \"phone_state\" Package\n\n## Step 1: Adding the Dependency\n\nTo get started, add the `phone_state` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  phone_state: ^latest_version\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `^latest_version` with the latest version of the package.\n\n## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration\n\n### Android Configuration\n\n1. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.\n2. Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:\n\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE\"/>\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG\"/>\n```\n\n3. Ensure that your app's `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`:\n\n```groovy\nandroid {\n    ...\n    defaultConfig {\n        ...\n        minSdkVersion 21\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### iOS Configuration\n\n1. Open `Info.plist` located at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.\n2. Add the following keys to request permission to access phone state:\n\n```xml\n<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>\n<string>We need access to your contacts to provide better service.</string>\n<key>NSPhoneUsageDescription</key>\n<string>We need access to your phone state to manage calls.</string>\n```\n\n## Step 3: Using the Package\n\nNow that you have set up the package, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Below is a simple example of how to implement the `phone_state` package in your app.",

    "packageName": "redux_thunk",
    "description": "# Redux Thunk Flutter Package\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `redux_thunk` package is a middleware for Redux that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. This is particularly useful for handling asynchronous actions, such as API calls, in a clean and manageable way. By using `redux_thunk`, you can dispatch actions based on the results of asynchronous operations, making your state management more powerful and flexible.\n\n### When to Use Redux Thunk\n\nYou should consider using `redux_thunk` in your Flutter applications when:\n\n- You need to perform asynchronous operations (like fetching data from an API) and want to manage the resulting state in a Redux store.\n- You want to keep your action creators clean and focused on their responsibilities.\n- You need to handle complex state transitions based on the results of asynchronous actions.\n\n### Features\n\n- **Asynchronous Action Creators**: Write action creators that can perform asynchronous operations.\n- **Dispatch Actions**: Dispatch actions based on the results of those operations.\n- **Middleware Support**: Integrates seamlessly with Redux middleware, allowing for a clean architecture.",
    "tutorial": "## Tutorial: Setting Up Redux Thunk in Flutter\n\n### Step 1: Add Dependencies\n\nTo get started, you need to add the `redux` and `redux_thunk` packages to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  redux: ^5.0.0\n  redux_thunk: ^0.8.0\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create the Redux Store\n\nYou need to create a Redux store that uses the `redux_thunk` middleware. Here’s how to set it up:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:redux/redux.dart';\nimport 'package:redux_thunk/redux_thunk.dart';\n\n// Define your app state\nclass AppState {\n  final String data;\n\n  AppState({this.data = ''});\n}\n\n// Define your reducer\nAppState appReducer(AppState state, dynamic action) {\n  if (action is UpdateDataAction) {\n    return AppState(data: action.data);\n  }\n  return state;\n}\n\n// Define your action\nclass UpdateDataAction {\n  final String data;\n\n  UpdateDataAction(this.data);\n}\n\n// Create the store\nfinal store = Store<AppState>(\n  appReducer,\n  initialState: AppState(),\n  middleware: [thunkMiddleware],\n);\n```\n\n### Step 3: Using Redux Thunk\n\nNow, you can create an asynchronous action creator using `redux_thunk`. Here’s an example of how to fetch data from an API:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:http/http.dart' as http;\nimport 'dart:convert';\n\n// Thunk action to fetch data\nThunkAction<AppState> fetchData() {\n  return (Store<AppState> store) async {\n    final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/data'));\n    if (response.statusCode == 200) {\n      final data = json.decode(response.body)['data'];\n      store.dispatch(UpdateDataAction(data));\n    } else {\n      throw Exception('Failed to load data');\n    }\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Integrate with Flutter\n\nFinally, integrate the Redux store with your Flutter application. Use the `StoreProvider` to make the store available to your widget tree:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:redux/redux.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter_redux/flutter_redux.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return StoreProvider<AppState>(\n      store: store,\n      child: MaterialApp(\n        home: HomeScreen(),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Redux Thunk Example')),\n      body: Center(\n        child: StoreConnector<AppState, String>(\n          converter: (store) => store.state.data,\n          builder: (context, data) {\n            return Column(\n              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n              children: [\n                Text(data),\n                ElevatedButton(\n                  onPressed: () {\n                    StoreProvider.of<AppState>(context).dispatch(fetchData());\n                  },\n                  child: Text('Fetch Data'),\n                ),\n              ],\n            );\n          },\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Platform-Specific Details\n\n- **Android**: Ensure you have internet permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"/>\n```\n\n- **iOS**: Make sure to add the appropriate permissions in your `Info.plist` if you are making network requests.\n\n### Optimizations\n\n- Consider using `flutter_redux` for easier integration of Redux with Flutter widgets.\n- Use `StoreConnector` to optimize widget rebuilds based on state changes.",

    "description": "# Checked YAML Flutter Package\n\nThe `checked_yaml` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that simplifies the process of working with YAML data. It provides a way to parse YAML files and validate their structure against predefined schemas, ensuring that the data adheres to expected formats. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where configuration files are used, such as in settings for applications, data-driven UIs, or any situation where structured data is required.\n\n## When to Use `checked_yaml`\n\n- **Configuration Management**: When your Flutter application requires configuration settings that can be easily modified without recompiling the app, YAML files are a great choice. The `checked_yaml` package allows you to load and validate these configurations at runtime.\n  \n- **Data Validation**: If your application relies on external data sources (like APIs or local files), using `checked_yaml` can help ensure that the data conforms to expected structures, reducing runtime errors.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Schema Validation**: Automatically checks if the parsed YAML data matches the expected structure.\n- **Error Handling**: Provides detailed error messages when validation fails, making debugging easier.\n- **Ease of Use**: Simple API for loading and parsing YAML files, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels.",
    "tutorial": "# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `checked_yaml`\n\n## Step 1: Adding the Dependency\n\nTo use the `checked_yaml` package, you first need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following line under dependencies:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  checked_yaml: ^2.0.0\n```\n\nRun `flutter pub get` to install the package.\n\n## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration\n\n### Android\n\nFor Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:\n\n```groovy\nandroid {\n    ...\n    defaultConfig {\n        ...\n        minSdkVersion 21\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### iOS\n\nFor iOS, you may need to set the deployment target in your `ios/Podfile`:\n\n```ruby\nplatform :ios, '10.0'\n```\n\n## Step 3: Using the Package\n\nNow that you have the package installed, you can start using it in your Flutter application. Here’s a simple example of how to load and validate a YAML file.\n\n1. Create a YAML file named `config.yaml` in your `assets` directory:\n\n```yaml\napp_name: My Flutter App\nversion: 1.0.0\nfeatures:\n  - feature1\n  - feature2\n```\n\n2.

The main function is the entry point of the application.\n// 2. Puppeteer is initialized in headless mode for faster execution.\n// 3. A new page is created to navigate to the specified URL.\n// 4. The application navigates to 'https://example.com'.\n// 5. The title of the page is extracted and printed to the console.\n// 6. A screenshot of the page is taken and saved as 'screenshot.png'.\n// 7. Finally, the browser is closed to free up resources.\n```\n\n// The application flow is straightforward: it initializes Puppeteer, navigates to a webpage, extracts the title, takes a screenshot, and then closes the browser. This demonstrates the key features of the Puppeteer package, including navigation, data extraction, and screenshot functionality.\n```"

    "description": "# Flutter Lifecycle Package: A Comprehensive Overview\n\nThe Flutter lifecycle package is a powerful tool that helps developers manage the lifecycle of their Flutter applications more effectively. It provides a way to listen to various lifecycle events, such as when the app is paused, resumed, or terminated. This is particularly useful for managing resources, saving application state, and optimizing performance.\n\n### When to Use the Lifecycle Package\n\nYou should consider using the lifecycle package in scenarios such as:\n\n- **State Management**: When you need to save the state of your application during transitions (e.g., when the app goes into the background).\n- **Resource Management**: To release resources (like network connections or database connections) when the app is not in use.\n- **Analytics**: To track user engagement by monitoring when users enter or exit the app.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Lifecycle Callbacks**: Provides callbacks for various lifecycle events, allowing you to execute code at specific points in the app's lifecycle.\n- **Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.\n- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing Flutter applications with minimal setup.\n\n##",
    "tutorial": "# Setting Up the Flutter Lifecycle Package\n\nTo get started with the lifecycle package, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Add Dependency\n\nAdd the lifecycle package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  lifecycle: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev\n```\n\n### Step 2: Import the Package\n\nIn your Dart file, import the lifecycle package:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:lifecycle/lifecycle.dart';\n```\n\n### Step 3: Implement Lifecycle Callbacks\n\nYou can implement the lifecycle callbacks in your main application class. Here’s how to do it for both Android and iOS:\n\n#### Android Configuration\n\nFor Android, ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions and configurations. Typically, no additional configurations are needed for lifecycle management.\n\n#### iOS Configuration\n\nFor iOS, ensure that your `Info.plist` file is configured correctly. You may need to add permissions for background tasks if your app requires it.\n\n### Step 4: Using the Lifecycle Callbacks\n\nYou can now use the lifecycle callbacks in your application. Here’s a simple example of how to listen to lifecycle events:\n\n```dart\nclass RealFlutter extends StatefulWidget {\n  @override\n  _RealFlutterState createState() => _RealFlutterState();\n}\n\nclass _RealFlutterState extends State<RealFlutter> with LifecycleObserver {\n  @override\n  void onResume() {\n    super.onResume();\n    // Code to execute when the app is resumed\n  }\n\n  @override\n  void onPause() {\n    super.onPause();\n    // Code to execute when the app is paused\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      home: Scaffold(\n        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Lifecycle Example')),\n        body: Center(child: Text('Observe the lifecycle events')),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n##",

    "main": "```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:carrier_info/carrier_info.dart';\nimport 'package:permission_handler/permission_handler.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Carrier Info Example',\n      home: CarrierInfoScreen(),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass CarrierInfoScreen extends StatefulWidget {\n  @override\n  _CarrierInfoScreenState createState() => _CarrierInfoScreenState();\n}\n\nclass _CarrierInfoScreenState extends State<CarrierInfoScreen> {\n  String carrierName = 'Unknown';\n  String countryCode = 'Unknown';\n  String networkType = 'Unknown';\n\n  @override\n  void initState() {\n    super.initState();\n    _getCarrierInfo();\n  }\n\n  // Function to get carrier information\n  void _getCarrierInfo() async {\n    // Check for phone permission\n    if (await Permission.phone.request().isGranted) {\n      // Retrieve carrier information\n      CarrierInfo carrierInfo = await CarrierInfo.getCarrierInfo();\n      setState(() {\n        carrierName = carrierInfo.carrierName; // Set carrier name\n        countryCode = carrierInfo.countryCode; // Set country code\n        networkType = carrierInfo.networkType; // Set network type\n      });\n    } else {\n      // Handle the case when permission is denied\n      setState(() {\n        carrierName = 'Permission Denied';\n      });\n    }\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(\n        title: Text('Carrier Info'),\n      ),\n      body: Center(\n        child: Column(\n          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n          children: <Widget>[\n            Text('Carrier Name: $carrierName'),\n            Text('Country Code: $countryCode'),\n            Text('Network Type: $networkType'),\n          ],\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// Application Flow Explanation:\n// 1. The application starts with the main function, which runs the MyApp widget.\n// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a title and sets CarrierInfoScreen as the home widget.\n// 3. CarrierInfoScreen is a stateful widget that initializes the carrier information in its state.\n// 4. In the initState method, _getCarrierInfo is called to fetch the carrier details.\n// 5. _getCarrierInfo checks for phone permission and retrieves carrier information if granted.\n// 6. The retrieved information is displayed in the UI using Text widgets.\n// 7. If permission is denied, it updates the UI to indicate that permission was denied.\n```"

    "description": "# ObjectBox Flutter Libraries\n\n## Overview\nThe `objectbox_flutter_libs` package is a powerful and efficient database solution for Flutter applications. It provides a NoSQL database that is designed for high performance and ease of use, making it an excellent choice for mobile applications that require fast data access and storage. ObjectBox is particularly well-suited for applications that need to handle large amounts of data with minimal latency.\n\n### When to Use ObjectBox\n- **Offline-First Applications**: If your app needs to function without an internet connection, ObjectBox allows you to store data locally and sync it when the connection is available.\n- **Real-Time Applications**: For apps that require real-time data updates, ObjectBox's reactive data features enable automatic UI updates when the underlying data changes.\n- **Performance-Critical Applications**: ObjectBox is optimized for speed, making it ideal for applications that require quick read and write operations.\n\n### Key Features\n- **High Performance**: ObjectBox is designed for speed, with low latency and high throughput.\n- **Reactive Programming**: Automatically update the UI when data changes, using streams.\n- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS.\n- **Easy to Use**: Simple API that integrates well with Flutter's architecture.\n- **NoSQL Database**: Flexible data models that can evolve over time without complex migrations.",
    "tutorial": "## Tutorial: Setting Up ObjectBox in Flutter\n\n### Step 1: Add Dependencies\nTo get started, add the `objectbox` and `objectbox_flutter_libs` packages to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  objectbox: ^2.0.0\n  objectbox_flutter_libs: ^2.0.0\n```\n\n### Step 2: Generate ObjectBox Model\nCreate a model class that represents the data you want to store. For example, let's create a simple `Note` model:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:objectbox/objectbox.dart';\n\n@Entity()\nclass Note {\n  int id; // Unique ID for each note\n  String text; // Content of the note\n\n  Note({this.id = 0, required this.text});\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Initialize ObjectBox\nYou need to initialize ObjectBox in your Flutter application. This is typically done in the `main` function. Here’s how to do it:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:objectbox/objectbox.dart';\nimport 'objectbox.g.dart'; // Generated file\n\nvoid main() async {\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n  final store = await openStore(); // Open the ObjectBox store\n  runApp(MyApp(store: store));\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Platform-Specific Configuration\n#### Android\nMake sure to add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\"/>\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\"/>\n```\n\n#### iOS\nFor iOS, ensure you have the following in your `Info.plist`:\n\n```xml\n<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>\n<string>We need access to your photo library to save notes.</string>\n```\n\n### Step 5: Using ObjectBox\nYou can now use ObjectBox to create, read, update, and delete notes. Here’s a simple example of how to add a note:\n\n```dart\nvoid addNote() {\n  final note = Note(text: \"This is a new note\");\n  store.box<Note>().put(note); // Save the note to the database\n}\n```\n\n### Step 6: Querying Data\nTo retrieve notes from the database, you can use the following code:\n\n```dart\nList<Note> getNotes() {\n  return store.box<Note>().getAll(); // Get all notes\n}\n```\n\n### Step 7: Reactive Updates\nTo listen for changes in the database, you can use streams:\n\n```dart\nfinal notesStream = store.box<Note>().query().watch(triggerImmediately: true);\n```\n\nThis will automatically update your UI whenever the notes change.",

Below is a simple example of how to implement the `flutter_expandable_table` in your app.",
    "main": "```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter_expandable_table/flutter_expandable_table.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(RealFlutter());\n}\n\nclass RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Flutter Expandable Table Demo',\n      home: Scaffold(\n        appBar: AppBar(\n          title: Text('Expandable Table Example'),\n        ),\n        body: ExpandableTableDemo(),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass ExpandableTableDemo extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    // Sample data for the expandable table\n    final List<Map<String, dynamic>> data = [\n      {\n        'name': 'Item 1',\n        'details': 'Details about Item 1',\n      },\n      {\n        'name': 'Item 2',\n        'details': 'Details about Item 2',\n      },\n      {\n        'name': 'Item 3',\n        'details': 'Details about Item 3',\n      },\n    ];\n\n    return ExpandableTable(\n      columns: [\n        // Define the columns of the table\n        TableColumn(label: Text('Name')),\n      ],\n      rows: data.map((item) {\n        return ExpandableTableRow(\n          // Each row can be expanded\n          header: Text(item['name']),\n          expandedContent: Text(item['details']),\n        );\n      }).toList(),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// Application Flow Explanation:\n// 1. The main function starts the app by calling runApp with the RealFlutter widget.\n// 2. RealFlutter builds a MaterialApp with a title and a home Scaffold containing an AppBar and body.\n// 3. The body contains the ExpandableTableDemo widget, which is responsible for displaying the expandable table.\n// 4. Inside ExpandableTableDemo, we define a list of sample data with names and details.\n// 5. The ExpandableTable widget is created with defined columns and rows.\n// 6. Each row is represented by an ExpandableTableRow, which has a header and expandable content.\n// 7. When a user taps on a row, it expands to show more details about the item.\n```\n\n// The above code demonstrates how to create a simple Flutter application using the `flutter_expandable_table` package. The application consists of an expandable table that displays a list of items. Each item can be expanded to reveal additional details, providing a clean and organized way to present data to users.\n```"

    "description": "# Sentry Dio Flutter Package\n\nThe **sentry_dio** package is a powerful integration that allows developers to capture and report errors in their Flutter applications using the Sentry error tracking service. This package is particularly useful for applications that rely on the Dio HTTP client for making network requests. By integrating Sentry with Dio, developers can automatically log any errors that occur during HTTP requests, providing valuable insights into issues that users may encounter.\n\n## When to Use Sentry Dio\n\nYou should consider using the **sentry_dio** package in scenarios such as:\n\n- **Error Tracking**: When you want to monitor and track errors that occur during network requests in your Flutter application.\n- **User Experience Improvement**: To gather data on failed requests, which can help you improve the user experience by addressing issues proactively.\n- **Debugging**: When you need detailed error reports that include stack traces and context about the request that failed.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Automatic Error Reporting**: Automatically captures and reports errors that occur during HTTP requests made with Dio.\n- **Contextual Information**: Provides detailed context about the error, including the request URL, headers, and response data.\n- **Customizable**: Allows customization of error reporting, including the ability to filter out certain errors or add additional context.",
    "tutorial": "# Tutorial: Setting Up Sentry Dio\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the **sentry_dio** package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.\n\n## Step 1: Add Dependencies\n\nFirst, you need to add the **sentry_dio** and **dio** packages to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  dio: ^5.0.0\n  sentry_dio: ^6.0.0\n```\n\nRun `flutter pub get` to install the new dependencies.\n\n## Step 2: Configure Sentry\n\nBefore using Sentry, you need to initialize it with your Sentry DSN (Data Source Name). You can find your DSN in your Sentry project settings.\n\nIn your `main.dart` file, initialize Sentry as follows:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';\n\nvoid main() async {\n  // Initialize Sentry\n  await Sentry.init(\n    (options) {\n      options.dsn = 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN';\n    },\n    appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Step 3: Set Up Dio with Sentry\n\nNow, you need to configure Dio to use the Sentry interceptor. This interceptor will automatically capture errors from HTTP requests.\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:dio/dio.dart';\nimport 'package:sentry_dio/sentry_dio.dart';\n\nclass ApiService {\n  final Dio dio;\n\n  ApiService()\n      : dio = Dio()..interceptors.add(SentryDioInterceptor());\n}\n```\n\n## Step 4: Making Requests\n\nYou can now use the `ApiService` class to make HTTP requests. Any errors that occur during these requests will be automatically reported to Sentry.\n\n```dart\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      home: Scaffold(\n        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Sentry Dio Example')),\n        body: Center(\n          child: ElevatedButton(\n            onPressed: () async {\n              final apiService = ApiService();\n              try {\n                final response = await apiService.dio.get('https://api.example.com/data');\n                print(response.data);\n              } catch (e) {\n                // Handle error\n                print('Error occurred: $e');\n              }\n            },\n            child: Text('Make Request'),\n          ),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Platform-Specific Details\n\n### Android\n\nEnsure that you have the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"/>\n```\n\n### iOS\n\nFor iOS, ensure that you have the appropriate permissions in your `Info.plist`:\n\n```xml\n<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>\n<dict>\n  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>\n  <true/>\n</dict>\n```\n\nWith these steps completed, your Flutter application is now set up to use the **sentry_dio** package for error tracking during HTTP requests.",

    "tutorial": "# Tutorial: Setting Up amplify_authenticator in Your Flutter App\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `amplify_authenticator` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.\n\n## Step 1: Add Dependencies\n\nFirst, you need to add the `amplify_authenticator` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. You also need to include the `amplify_flutter` and `amplify_auth_cognito` packages for authentication.\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  amplify_flutter: ^0.2.0\n  amplify_auth_cognito: ^0.2.0\n  amplify_authenticator: ^0.2.0\n```\n\nRun `flutter pub get` to install the new dependencies.\n\n## Step 2: Configure AWS Amplify\n\nBefore using the `amplify_authenticator`, you need to configure AWS Amplify in your project. This involves setting up an AWS account and creating a Cognito User Pool.\n\n1. **Create an AWS Account**: If you don’t have one, sign up at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).\n2. **Set Up Cognito User Pool**:\n   - Go to the AWS Management Console.\n   - Navigate to Amazon Cognito and create a new User Pool.\n   - Configure the pool settings, including sign-in options and security policies.\n   - After creating the pool, note down the User Pool ID and App Client ID.\n\n3. **Configure Amplify**: Create a new file named `amplifyconfiguration.json` in your `assets` folder and add the following configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"auth\": {\n    \"plugins\": {\n      \"awsCognitoAuthPlugin\": {\n        \"UserPoolId\": \"YOUR_USER_POOL_ID\",\n        \"AppClientId\": \"YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID\",\n        \"Region\": \"YOUR_AWS_REGION\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `YOUR_USER_POOL_ID`, `YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID`, and `YOUR_AWS_REGION` with your actual values.\n\n## Step 3: Initialize Amplify in Your App\n\nIn your `main.dart` file, initialize Amplify and configure the authenticator.\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:amplify_flutter/amplify.dart';\nimport 'package:amplify_auth_cognito/amplify_auth_cognito.dart';\nimport 'package:amplify_authenticator/amplify_authenticator.dart';\nimport 'amplifyconfiguration.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Amplify Authenticator Demo',\n      home: Authenticator(\n        child: HomeScreen(),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {\n  @override\n  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();\n}\n\nclass _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {\n  @override\n  void initState() {\n    super.initState();\n    _configureAmplify();\n  }\n\n  Future<void> _configureAmplify() async {\n    final auth = AmplifyAuthCognito();\n    await Amplify.addPlugin(auth);\n    await Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Home')),\n      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to the Home Screen!')),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Platform-Specific Details\n\n#### Android\n- Ensure you have the correct permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Add the following permissions:\n\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"/>\n```\n\n#### iOS\n- For iOS, ensure you have the correct configurations in your `Info.plist` file. Add the following:\n\n```xml\n<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>\n<dict>\n  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>\n  <true/>\n</dict>\n```\n\n## Step 4: Run Your Application\n\nNow that everything is set up, you can run your application using `flutter run`. You should see the authentication UI provided by the `amplify_authenticator` package.",

    "description": "# Replay Bloc Flutter Package\n\nThe `replay_bloc` package is a powerful state management solution for Flutter applications that allows developers to easily manage and replay state changes. This package is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to maintain a history of state changes and potentially revert to previous states. It leverages the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern, which is a popular architecture in Flutter for separating business logic from UI.\n\n## When to Use `replay_bloc`\n\nYou might consider using `replay_bloc` in the following scenarios:\n\n- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: If your application requires undo and redo capabilities, `replay_bloc` can help manage the state history effectively.\n- **State Restoration**: In applications where users might navigate away and return, maintaining a history of states can enhance user experience.\n- **Complex State Management**: For applications with complex state transitions, `replay_bloc` simplifies the management of state changes.\n\n## Features\n\n- **State Replay**: Easily replay previous states.\n- **Undo/Redo Support**: Built-in support for undoing and redoing state changes.\n- **Integration with Flutter**: Seamlessly integrates with Flutter's widget tree.\n- **Customizable**: Allows for custom state management strategies.\n\nBy using `replay_bloc`, developers can create more robust and user-friendly applications that handle state changes gracefully.",
    "tutorial": "# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using `replay_bloc`\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the `replay_bloc` package and demonstrate how to use it in a Flutter application.\n\n## Step 1: Adding Dependency\n\nTo get started, add the `replay_bloc` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  replay_bloc: ^1.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev\n```\n\n## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration\n\n### Android\n\nFor Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` is set to at least 21 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:\n\n```groovy\nandroid {\n    ...\n    defaultConfig {\n        ...\n        minSdkVersion 21\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### iOS\n\nFor iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the latest iOS versions:\n\n```ruby\nplatform :ios, '10.0'\n```\n\n## Step 3: Importing the Package\n\nIn your Dart files, import the `replay_bloc` package:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:replay_bloc/replay_bloc.dart';\n```\n\n## Step 4: Creating a Simple BLoC\n\nCreate a simple BLoC class that extends `ReplayBloc`. This class will manage the state of your application.\n\n```dart\nclass RealFlutter extends ReplayBloc<int> {\n  RealFlutter() : super(0); // Initial state is 0\n\n  void increment() {\n    add(state + 1); // Increment the state\n  }\n\n  void decrement() {\n    add(state - 1); // Decrement the state\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Step 5: Using the BLoC in Your Widget\n\nNow, you can use the `RealFlutter` BLoC in your Flutter widget tree. Here’s an example of how to integrate it:\n\n```dart\nclass CounterPage extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return BlocProvider(\n      create: (context) => RealFlutter(),\n      child: Scaffold(\n        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Replay Bloc Example')),\n        body: Center(\n          child: BlocBuilder<RealFlutter, int>(\n            builder: (context, count) {\n              return Text('Count: $count');\n            },\n          ),\n        ),\n        floatingActionButton: Column(\n          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.end,\n          children: [\n            FloatingActionButton(\n              onPressed: () => context.read<RealFlutter>().increment(),\n              tooltip: 'Increment',\n              child: Icon(Icons.add),\n            ),\n            SizedBox(height: 10),\n            FloatingActionButton(\n              onPressed: () => context.read<RealFlutter>().decrement(),\n              tooltip: 'Decrement',\n              child: Icon(Icons.remove),\n            ),\n          ],\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith these steps, you have successfully set up and used the `replay_bloc` package in your Flutter application.",

    "description": "# Description\n\nThe `network_image_mock` package is a powerful tool for Flutter developers that allows for easy mocking of network images in your applications. This package is particularly useful during the development and testing phases, where you may not want to rely on actual network calls to fetch images. Instead, you can use this package to simulate image loading, ensuring that your UI behaves as expected without the need for a live internet connection.\n\n## When to Use\n\n- **Development Phase**: When building your app, you may want to test how your UI handles image loading without making actual network requests.\n- **Testing**: In unit tests or widget tests, you can use this package to provide mock images, allowing you to verify that your widgets display correctly.\n- **Offline Mode**: If your app has an offline mode, you can use this package to show placeholder images when the network is unavailable.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Easy Integration**: Simple to add to your Flutter project with minimal setup.\n- **Customizable**: You can specify different mock images for different scenarios.\n- **Flexible**: Works seamlessly with the `Image.network` widget, allowing you to replace network images with mock images effortlessly.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nTo use the `network_image_mock` package, you would typically wrap your `Image.network` calls with the `NetworkImageMock` widget provided by the package. This allows you to specify a mock image that will be displayed instead of fetching from the network.\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:network_image_mock/network_image_mock.dart';\n\nmockNetworkImage(() => Image.network('https://example.com/image.png'));\n```\n\nThis simple line of code will replace the network image with a mock image during development or testing.",
    "tutorial": "# Tutorial\n\n## Setup Process\n\nTo get started with the `network_image_mock` package, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Add Dependency**: Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the package under dependencies.\n\n   ```yaml\n   dependencies:\n     flutter:\n       sdk: flutter\n     network_image_mock: ^2.0.0\n   ```\n\n2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command in your terminal to install the package.\n\n   ```bash\n   flutter pub get\n   ```\n\n3. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:\n   - **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21.\n   - **iOS**: No additional configuration is required, but ensure you have the latest version of Xcode.\n\n4. **Import the Package**: In your Dart files, import the package to start using it.\n\n   ```dart\n   import 'package:network_image_mock/network_image_mock.dart';\n   ```\n\n## Using the Package\n\nTo use the `network_image_mock` package, you can wrap your image loading logic with the `mockNetworkImage` function. Here’s a simple example:\n\n```dart\nmockNetworkImage(() {\n  return Image.network('https://example.com/image.png');\n});\n```\n\nThis will replace the network image with a mock image during development. You can also specify a custom image to be used as a mock.\n\n### Example of Custom Mock Image\n\n```dart\nmockNetworkImage(() {\n  return Image.network('https://example.com/image.png', \n    loadingBuilder: (context, child, loadingProgress) {\n      return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());\n    },\n    errorBuilder: (context, error, stackTrace) {\n      return Image.asset('assets/images/error_image.png');\n    },\n  );\n});\n```\n\nThis example shows how to handle loading and error states while using mock images.",

    "description": "# Overview of the Elementary Flutter Package\n\nThe **elementary** package is a powerful state management solution for Flutter applications, designed to simplify the development process by providing a clear architecture and reducing boilerplate code. It is particularly useful for building complex applications where managing state can become cumbersome. \n\n## When to Use the Elementary Package\n\nYou should consider using the elementary package when:\n- You are developing a medium to large-scale Flutter application that requires a robust state management solution.\n- You want to implement a clean architecture that separates business logic from UI code.\n- You need to manage multiple states and events efficiently without excessive boilerplate.\n\n## Key Features\n- **Separation of Concerns**: The package promotes a clear separation between UI and business logic, making your codebase easier to maintain.\n- **Reactive Programming**: It leverages reactive programming principles, allowing your UI to automatically update in response to state changes.\n- **Built-in Dependency Injection**: Elementary provides a simple way to manage dependencies, making it easier to test and maintain your application.\n- **Support for Multiple Platforms**: The package is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.\n\nIn summary, the elementary package is an excellent choice for Flutter developers looking to implement a clean and efficient architecture in their applications.",
    "tutorial": "# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using the Elementary Package\n\n## Step 1: Adding the Dependency\n\nTo get started with the elementary package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following line under dependencies:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  elementary: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the latest version\n```\n\nAfter adding the dependency, run the following command in your terminal to install it:\n\n```bash\nflutter pub get\n```\n\n## Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration\n\n### Android Configuration\n\nFor Android, ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21:\n\n```groovy\nandroid {\n    ...\n    defaultConfig {\n        ...\n        minSdkVersion 21\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### iOS Configuration\n\nFor iOS, you may need to update your `ios/Podfile` to ensure compatibility with the elementary package. Make sure to set the platform version:\n\n```ruby\nplatform :ios, '10.0'  # or higher\n```\n\n## Step 3: Basic Usage\n\nTo use the elementary package, you will typically create a `ViewModel` that extends `Elementary` and a corresponding `Widget` that listens to the state changes. Here’s a simple example:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:elementary/elementary.dart';\n\nclass RealFlutter extends ElementaryWidget<MyModel> {\n  RealFlutter({Key? key}) : super(key: key);\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context, MyModel model) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Elementary Example')),\n      body: Center(\n        child: Text('Current Count: ${model.count}'),\n      ),\n      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(\n        onPressed: model.increment,\n        child: Icon(Icons.add),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyModel extends ElementaryModel {\n  int count = 0;\n\n  void increment() {\n    count++;\n    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners to update the UI\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `RealFlutter` is the main widget that displays the current count and a button to increment it. The `MyModel` class manages the state.\n\n## Step 4: Running the Application\n\nOnce you have set up your application, you can run it on an emulator or a physical device using:\n\n```bash\nflutter run\n```\n\nThis will launch your Flutter application, and you should see the UI reflecting the state managed by the elementary package.",
    "main": "```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:elementary/elementary.dart';\n\n// Main entry point of the application\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\n// MyApp widget that sets up the MaterialApp\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Elementary Example',\n      theme: ThemeData(\n        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,\n      ),\n      home: RealFlutter(), // Set the home to our RealFlutter widget\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// RealFlutter widget that extends ElementaryWidget\nclass RealFlutter extends ElementaryWidget<MyModel> {\n  RealFlutter({Key? key}) : super(key: key);\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context, MyModel model) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Elementary Example')),\n      body: Center(\n        child: Text('Current Count: ${model.count}'), // Display current count\n      ),\n      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(\n        onPressed: model.increment, // Increment count on button press\n        child: Icon(Icons.add),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// MyModel class that extends ElementaryModel\nclass MyModel extends ElementaryModel {\n  int count = 0; // Initial count\n\n  // Method to increment the count\n  void increment() {\n    count++; // Increase count by 1\n    notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners to update the UI\n  }\n}\n\n// Application flow explanation:\n// 1. The application starts with the main() function, which runs MyApp.\n// 2. MyApp sets up a MaterialApp with a title and theme, and sets RealFlutter as the home widget.\n// 3. RealFlutter extends ElementaryWidget and builds a UI with a Scaffold.\n// 4. The UI displays the current count and has a FloatingActionButton to increment the count.\n// 5. When the button is pressed, the increment method in MyModel is called, which updates the count and notifies listeners.\n// 6. The UI automatically updates to reflect the new count due to the reactive nature of the elementary package.\n```"

The _refreshData function simulates a network call and updates the list of items.\n// 4. The SwipeRefresh widget wraps around a ListView, allowing users to pull down to refresh.\n// 5. When the user swipes down, the onRefresh callback is triggered, calling the _refreshData function.\n// 6. After the simulated delay, a new item is added to the list, and the UI is updated with setState.\n```"
