Here's a simple example:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:json_path/json_path.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  final json = {\n    'store': {\n      'book': [\n        {'category': 'fiction', 'title': 'The Great Gatsby'},\n        {'category': 'non-fiction', 'title': 'Sapiens'}\n      ]\n    }\n  };\n\n  final path = JsonPath(r'$.store.book[?(@.category == \"fiction\")].title');\n  final matches = path.read(json).map((match) => match.value).toList();\n\n  print(matches); // Output: ['The Great Gatsby']\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we use a JSON path to extract the title of books in the \"fiction\" category.",

    "description": "# Flutter Platform Package: An Overview\n\nThe Flutter `platform` package is a powerful tool that allows developers to interact with platform-specific features and APIs in a Flutter application. This package is essential when you need to access native functionalities that are not directly available through Flutter's core libraries. \n\n## When to Use the Platform Package\n\nThe `platform` package is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to:\n- Access device-specific features such as sensors, camera, or GPS.\n- Implement platform-specific UI components or behaviors.\n- Integrate with native code written in Swift, Kotlin, Java, or Objective-C.\n- Handle platform-specific permissions and configurations.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Platform Detection**: Easily determine the platform (iOS, Android, web, etc.) your app is running on.\n- **Platform-Specific Code**: Write code that only executes on certain platforms.\n- **Native Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with native code and libraries.\n- **Custom Platform Channels**: Create custom channels to communicate between Flutter and native code.\n\nThe `platform` package is a bridge that connects Flutter's cross-platform capabilities with the unique features of each platform, making it an indispensable tool for any Flutter developer aiming to create a truly native experience.",
    "tutorial": "# Setting Up and Using the Flutter Platform Package\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `platform` package in a Flutter project. We will cover platform-specific details for both Android and iOS, including necessary configurations and optimizations.\n\n## Setup Process\n\n1. **Add the Dependency**: First, add the `platform` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.\n\n   ```yaml\n   dependencies:\n     flutter:\n       sdk: flutter\n     platform: ^3.0.0\n   ```\n\n2. **Install the Package**: Run the following command to install the package:\n\n   ```bash\n   flutter pub get\n   ```\n\n3. **Import the Package**: Import the package in your Dart file where you intend to use it.\n\n   ```dart\n   import 'package:platform/platform.dart';\n   ```\n\n## Platform-Specific Details\n\n### Android\n\n- **Permissions**: Ensure that you declare any necessary permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. For example, if accessing the camera, add:\n\n  ```xml\n  <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.CAMERA\"/>\n  ```\n\n- **Gradle Configuration**: Make sure your `build.gradle` files are configured to support the minimum SDK version required by the features you are using.\n\n### iOS\n\n- **Info.plist**: Add any required permissions or configurations in the `Info.plist` file. For example, for camera access:\n\n  ```xml\n  <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>\n  <string>We need access to your camera for scanning QR codes.</string>\n  ```\n\n- **Podfile**: Ensure your `Podfile` is set up correctly to integrate with any native libraries you might be using.\n\n## Using the Platform Package\n\nTo use the `platform` package, you can create a class, `RealFlutter`, that utilizes platform-specific code. Here's a simple example:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:platform/platform.dart';\n\nclass RealFlutter {\n  final Platform _platform;\n\n  RealFlutter(this._platform);\n\n  void printPlatform() {\n    if (_platform.isAndroid) {\n      print('Running on Android');\n    } else if (_platform.isIOS) {\n      print('Running on iOS');\n    } else {\n      print('Running on an unsupported platform');\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis class uses the `platform` package to determine the current platform and print a message accordingly.",

The application starts by running the MyApp widget.\n// 2. MyApp builds a MaterialApp with a home page of MyHomePage.\n// 3. MyHomePage contains a button that, when pressed, calls the printPlatform method of the RealFlutter class.\n// 4. The RealFlutter class uses the platform package to determine the current platform and prints a message to the console.\n// 5. The console output will show whether the app is running on Android, iOS, or another platform.\n```\n```"

We'll cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS, although the package primarily targets Android.\n\n## Setup Process\n\n### Step 1: Add Dependency\n\nAdd the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  android_alarm_manager_plus: ^2.0.0\n```\n\nRun `flutter pub get` to install the package.\n\n### Step 2: Android Configuration\n\n1. **Modify `AndroidManifest.xml`**: Add the following permissions and service declaration inside the `<manifest>` tag:\n\n   ```xml\n   <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED\"/>\n   <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WAKE_LOCK\"/>\n\n   <application>\n       <service\n           android:name=\"dev.fluttercommunity.plus.androidalarmmanager.AlarmService\"\n           android:permission=\"android.permission.BIND_JOB_SERVICE\"\n           android:exported=\"true\"/>\n   </application>\n   ```\n\n2. **Update `MainActivity.java` or `MainActivity.kt`**: Ensure your main activity extends `FlutterActivity`.\n\n3. **Initialize the Alarm Manager**: In your `main.dart`, initialize the alarm manager before running the app:\n\n   ```dart\n   import 'package:android_alarm_manager_plus/android_alarm_manager_plus.dart';\n\n   void main() async {\n     WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n     await AndroidAlarmManager.initialize();\n     runApp(MyApp());\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: iOS Configuration\n\nWhile the package is primarily for Android, ensure your iOS app is set up correctly to avoid any build issues:\n\n- Ensure your `Info.plist` is correctly configured for any background modes you might use, although `android_alarm_manager_plus` does not directly support iOS.\n\n## Using the Package\n\nTo schedule an alarm, use the `AndroidAlarmManager.oneShot` or `AndroidAlarmManager.periodic` methods. Here's a simple example:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:android_alarm_manager_plus/android_alarm_manager_plus.dart';\n\nvoid printHello() {\n  final DateTime now = DateTime.now();\n  print(\"[$now] Hello, world!\");\n}\n\nvoid main() async {\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n  await AndroidAlarmManager.initialize();\n  runApp(MyApp());\n\n  // Schedule a one-time alarm\n  await AndroidAlarmManager.oneShot(\n    const Duration(seconds: 5),\n    0, // Unique alarm ID\n    printHello,\n  );\n}\n```",
    "main": "```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:android_alarm_manager_plus/android_alarm_manager_plus.dart';\n\n// The main class of the application\nclass RealFlutter extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Alarm Manager Demo',\n      theme: ThemeData(\n        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,\n      ),\n      home: MyHomePage(),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// Home page of the application\nclass MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {\n  @override\n  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();\n}\n\nclass _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {\n  @override\n  void initState() {\n    super.initState();\n    // Schedule a periodic alarm\n    AndroidAlarmManager.periodic(\n      const Duration(minutes: 1), // Interval for the alarm\n      1, // Unique alarm ID\n      callbackFunction, // Function to execute\n    );\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(\n        title: Text('Alarm Manager Demo'),\n      ),\n      body: Center(\n        child: Text(\n          'Check your console for alarm messages!',\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// Callback function to be executed by the alarm\nvoid callbackFunction() {\n  final DateTime now = DateTime.now();\n  print(\"[$now] Alarm triggered!\");\n}\n\nvoid main() async {\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n  await AndroidAlarmManager.initialize();\n  runApp(RealFlutter());\n}\n\n// Application Flow:\n// 1. The application starts by initializing the Android Alarm Manager.\n// 2. The `RealFlutter` class sets up the MaterialApp with a home page.\n// 3. The `MyHomePage` widget schedules a periodic alarm in its `initState` method.\n// 4. The `callbackFunction` is executed every minute, printing a message to the console.\n// 5. The app's UI displays a simple message, while the alarm runs in the background.\n```\n```"

Here, we will create a simple proxy that forwards requests to a target server.\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:shelf/shelf_io.dart' as io;\nimport 'package:shelf_proxy/shelf_proxy.dart';\n\nvoid main() async {\n  var server = await io.serve(\n    proxyHandler('https://target-server.com'),\n    'localhost',\n    8080,\n  );\n\n  print('Proxying at http://${server.address.host}:${server.port}');\n}\n```",
    "main": "```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:shelf/shelf_io.dart' as io;\nimport 'package:shelf_proxy/shelf_proxy.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n  startProxyServer();\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Shelf Proxy Demo',\n      theme: ThemeData(\n        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,\n      ),\n      home: ProxyHomePage(),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass ProxyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(\n        title: Text('Shelf Proxy Example'),\n      ),\n      body: Center(\n        child: Text('Proxy server is running...'),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nvoid startProxyServer() async {\n  // Start the proxy server on localhost at port 8080\n  var server = await io.serve(\n    proxyHandler('https://target-server.com'), // Forward requests to this target server\n    'localhost',\n    8080,\n  );\n\n  // Print the address and port of the proxy server\n  print('Proxying at http://${server.address.host}:${server.port}');\n}\n\n// The application starts by running the MyApp widget, which sets up a basic Flutter app.\n// The startProxyServer function is called to initialize the proxy server.\n// The proxy server listens on localhost at port 8080 and forwards requests to the specified target server.\n// The ProxyHomePage widget displays a simple UI indicating that the proxy server is running.\n```\n\n// The application flow is straightforward:\n// 1. The `main` function initializes the Flutter app and starts the proxy server.\n// 2. `MyApp` is the root widget, setting up the MaterialApp with a home page.\n// 3. `ProxyHomePage` is a simple UI component that shows a message indicating the proxy server's status.\n// 4. `startProxyServer` sets up the proxy server using `shelf_proxy`, forwarding requests to a specified target server.\n// 5. The server listens on localhost:8080, and any incoming requests are proxied to the target server.\n```"

    "tutorial": "# Setting Up and Using the Pigeon Package\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the setup process for the Pigeon package and demonstrate how to use it to communicate between Flutter and native code on both Android and iOS platforms.\n\n## Setup Process\n\n### Step 1: Add Pigeon to Your Project\n\nAdd Pigeon as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndev_dependencies:\n  pigeon: ^1.0.0\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define Your API\n\nCreate a Dart file to define the API that you want to use for communication. For example, create a file named `api.dart`:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:pigeon/pigeon.dart';\n\nclass RealFlutter {\n  String? message;\n}\n\n@HostApi()\nabstract class RealFlutterApi {\n  RealFlutter getRealFlutterMessage();\n  void setRealFlutterMessage(RealFlutter msg);\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Generate Code\n\nRun the Pigeon command to generate the necessary code:\n\n```bash\nflutter pub run pigeon \\\n  --input pigeons/api.dart \\\n  --dart_out lib/real_flutter_api.dart \\\n  --objc_header_out ios/Runner/real_flutter_api.h \\\n  --objc_source_out ios/Runner/real_flutter_api.m \\\n  --java_out android/app/src/main/java/com/example/app/RealFlutterApi.java\n```\n\n### Step 4: Implement Platform-Specific Code\n\n#### Android\n\nIn `RealFlutterApi.java`, implement the methods defined in your API:\n\n```java\npackage com.example.app;\n\nimport androidx.annotation.NonNull;\n\npublic class RealFlutterApiImpl implements RealFlutterApi {\n    @Override\n    public RealFlutter getRealFlutterMessage() {\n        RealFlutter message = new RealFlutter();\n        message.setMessage(\"Hello from Android!\");\n        return message;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void setRealFlutterMessage(@NonNull RealFlutter msg) {\n        // Handle the message from Flutter\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### iOS\n\nIn `real_flutter_api.m`, implement the methods:\n\n```objc\n#import \"real_flutter_api.h\"\n\n@implementation RealFlutterApiImpl\n- (RealFlutter *)getRealFlutterMessage:(FlutterError **)error {\n    RealFlutter *message = [[RealFlutter alloc] init];\n    message.message = @\"Hello from iOS!\";\n    return message;\n}\n\n- (void)setRealFlutterMessage:(RealFlutter *)msg error:(FlutterError **)error {\n    // Handle the message from Flutter\n}\n@end\n```\n\n### Step 5: Use the API in Flutter\n\nIn your Flutter code, use the generated API to communicate with the native code:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'real_flutter_api.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  final RealFlutterApi _api = RealFlutterApi();\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      home: Scaffold(\n        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Pigeon Example')),\n        body: FutureBuilder<RealFlutter>(\n          future: _api.getRealFlutterMessage(),\n          builder: (context, snapshot) {\n            if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {\n              return Center(child: Text(snapshot.data?.message ??

    "tutorial": "# Setting Up Flutter Translate\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up and using the `flutter_translate` package in a Flutter project. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.\n\n## Step 1: Add Dependency\n\nFirst, add the `flutter_translate` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  flutter_translate: ^3.0.0\n```\n\nRun `flutter pub get` to install the package.\n\n## Step 2: Create Translation Files\n\nCreate a directory named `assets/i18n` in the root of your project. Inside this directory, create JSON files for each language you want to support. For example, create `en.json` for English and `es.json` for Spanish.\n\nExample `en.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Hello World\",\n  \"greeting\": \"Welcome to RealFlutter\"\n}\n```\n\nExample `es.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Hola Mundo\",\n  \"greeting\": \"Bienvenido a RealFlutter\"\n}\n```\n\n## Step 3: Configure Asset Paths\n\nAdd the asset path to your `pubspec.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nflutter:\n  assets:\n    - assets/i18n/\n```\n\n## Step 4: Initialize Flutter Translate\n\nIn your `main.dart` file, initialize the `flutter_translate` package:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter_translate/flutter_translate.dart';\n\nvoid main() async {\n  var delegate = await LocalizationDelegate.create(\n      fallbackLocale: 'en',\n      supportedLocales: ['en', 'es']);\n\n  runApp(LocalizedApp(delegate, RealFlutter()));\n}\n```\n\n## Step 5: Platform-Specific Configurations\n\n### Android\n\nEnsure that your `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` file is properly configured to support localization.\n\n### iOS\n\nFor iOS, ensure that your `Info.plist` file includes the supported languages:\n\n```xml\n<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>\n<array>\n  <string>en</string>\n  <string>es</string>\n</array>\n```\n\n## Step 6: Using Translations in Widgets\n\nUse the `translate` function to access translations in your widgets:\n\n```dart\n@override\nWidget build(BuildContext context) {\n  return MaterialApp(\n    home: Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(\n        title: Text(translate('title')),\n      ),\n      body: Center(\n        child: Text(translate('greeting')),\n      ),\n    ),\n  );\n}\n```",

    "description": "# Understanding the `devicelocale` Flutter Package\n\nThe `devicelocale` Flutter package is a powerful tool designed to help developers easily access the current locale of a device. This package is particularly useful in applications that need to adapt their content based on the user's language and regional settings. By leveraging `devicelocale`, developers can enhance user experience by providing localized content, formatting dates and numbers according to regional preferences, and more.\n\n## When to Use `devicelocale`\n\n- **Localization**: When your app needs to support multiple languages and you want to automatically adjust the language based on the user's device settings.\n- **Regional Formatting**: To format dates, times, and numbers according to the user's locale.\n- **User Preferences**: To customize content or features based on the user's regional settings.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Get Current Locale**: Retrieve the current locale of the device.\n- **List Supported Locales**: Access a list of all locales supported by the device.\n- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.",
    "tutorial": "# Setting Up and Using the `devicelocale` Package\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `devicelocale` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use its features effectively.\n\n## Setup Process\n\n1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `devicelocale` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.\n\n   ```yaml\n   dependencies:\n     flutter:\n       sdk: flutter\n     devicelocale: ^0.4.0\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new package.\n\n3. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the package to access its functionalities.\n\n   ```dart\n   import 'package:devicelocale/devicelocale.dart';\n   ```\n\n## Platform-Specific Details\n\n### Android\n\n- Ensure that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file has the necessary permissions to access locale information. Typically, no additional permissions are required for this package.\n\n### iOS\n\n- For iOS, ensure that your project is configured to support the locales you intend to use. This can be done in the Xcode project settings under \"Info\" by adding the required languages.\n\n## Using the Package\n\nTo use the `devicelocale` package, you can call its methods to get the current locale or list all supported locales. Here's a simple example:\n\n```dart\nFuture<void> getCurrentLocale() async {\n  String? locale = await Devicelocale.currentLocale;\n  print(\"Current Locale: $locale\");\n}\n\nFuture<void> getSupportedLocales() async {\n  List<String>? locales = await Devicelocale.preferredLanguages;\n  print(\"Supported Locales: $locales\");\n}\n```",

We'll cover platform-specific details for both Android and iOS.\n\n## Setup Process\n\n1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `shelf_static` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.\n\n   ```yaml\n   dependencies:\n     shelf_static: ^1.0.0\n   ```\n\n2. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the necessary libraries.\n\n   ```dart\n   import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';\n   import 'package:shelf/shelf_io.dart' as io;\n   import 'package:shelf_static/shelf_static.dart';\n   ```\n\n3. **Create a Static Handler**: Use the `createStaticHandler` function to serve files from a directory.\n\n   ```dart\n   var handler = createStaticHandler('web', defaultDocument: 'index.html');\n   ```\n\n4. **Start the Server**: Use `shelf_io` to start the server.\n\n   ```dart\n   void main() async {\n     var server = await io.serve(handler, 'localhost', 8080);\n     print('Serving at http://${server.address.host}:${server.port}');\n   }\n   ```\n\n## Platform-Specific Details\n\n### Android\n\n- Ensure that your Android project is configured to allow network requests. This typically involves setting the `android:usesCleartextTraffic` attribute to `true` in your `AndroidManifest.xml` if you're testing on a local server.\n\n### iOS\n\n- For iOS, ensure that your app's `Info.plist` allows arbitrary loads if you're testing on a local server. Add the following entry:\n\n  ```xml\n  <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>\n  <dict>\n    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>\n    <true/>\n  </dict>\n  ```\n\n## Optimizations\n\n- **Caching**: Configure caching headers to improve performance for static files.\n- **Compression**: Use middleware to compress responses for faster load times.",
    "main": "```dart\nimport 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';\nimport 'package:shelf/shelf_io.dart' as io;\nimport 'package:shelf_static/shelf_static.dart';\n\nvoid main() async {\n  // Create a handler to serve static files from the 'web' directory\n  var handler = createStaticHandler('web', defaultDocument: 'index.html');\n\n  // Start the server on localhost at port 8080\n  var server = await io.serve(handler, 'localhost', 8080);\n\n  // Print the server address and port to the console\n  print('Serving at http://${server.address.host}:${server.port}');\n}\n\n// The above code sets up a simple server using the shelf_static package.\n// It serves static files from the 'web' directory, with 'index.html' as the default document.\n// The server listens on localhost at port 8080, making it accessible via http://localhost:8080.\n\n// Application Flow:\n// 1. Import necessary packages for handling HTTP requests and serving static files.\n// 2. Create a static file handler using `createStaticHandler`, specifying the directory and default document.\n// 3. Start the server using `io.serve`, passing the handler, host, and port.\n// 4. Output the server's address to the console for easy access during development.\n```\n\n// Summary of Application Flow:\n// - The application imports the required packages to handle HTTP requests and serve static files.\n// - A static file handler is created to serve files from the specified directory.\n// - The server is started on a specified host and port, and the address is printed to the console.\n// - This setup allows for efficient serving of static files, making it ideal for web applications or APIs that require static content delivery.\n```"

    "description": "# Soundpool Flutter Package: An Overview\n\nThe `soundpool` Flutter package is a powerful tool for developers looking to integrate audio playback capabilities into their Flutter applications. It is particularly useful for applications that require low-latency audio playback, such as games or interactive media apps. The package provides a simple API to load and play audio files, making it easy to manage sound effects and background music.\n\n## When to Use Soundpool\n\n- **Games**: For playing sound effects like explosions, jumps, or background music.\n- **Educational Apps**: To provide audio feedback or instructions.\n- **Interactive Media**: For applications that require synchronized audio playback with animations or other media.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Low Latency**: Designed for fast audio playback, minimizing delay.\n- **Multiple Sounds**: Supports playing multiple sounds simultaneously.\n- **Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS platforms.\n- **Simple API**: Easy to use with straightforward methods for loading and playing sounds.",
    "tutorial": "# Setting Up and Using Soundpool in Flutter\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `soundpool` package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it effectively.\n\n## Setup Process\n\n### Step 1: Add Dependency\n\nAdd the `soundpool` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  soundpool: ^2.1.0\n```\n\nRun `flutter pub get` to install the package.\n\n### Step 2: Platform-Specific Configuration\n\n#### Android\n\nNo additional configuration is required for Android. The package uses the Android `SoundPool` API, which is optimized for low-latency audio playback.\n\n#### iOS\n\nFor iOS, ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to play audio. Add the following to your `Info.plist` file:\n\n```xml\n<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>\n<string>We need access to the microphone to play audio.</string>\n```\n\n### Step 3: Using the Package\n\nTo use the `soundpool` package, you need to create an instance of the `Soundpool` class and load audio files. Here's a basic example:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:soundpool/soundpool.dart';\n\nclass RealFlutter {\n  final Soundpool _soundpool = Soundpool.fromOptions();\n\n  Future<int> loadSound(String assetPath) async {\n    return await rootBundle.load(assetPath).then((ByteData soundData) {\n      return _soundpool.load(soundData);\n    });\n  }\n\n  Future<void> playSound(int soundId) async {\n    await _soundpool.play(soundId);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a `RealFlutter` class that manages sound loading and playback. The `loadSound` method loads an audio file from the assets, and the `playSound` method plays the loaded sound.",

Add new icon sets for each alternate icon you want to use. Each icon set should be named according to the icon's role.\n\n2. **Update Info.plist**: Add the `CFBundleIcons` key to your `Info.plist` file to define the alternate icons:\n\n```xml\n<key>CFBundleIcons</key>\n<dict>\n  <key>CFBundlePrimaryIcon</key>\n  <dict>\n    <key>CFBundleIconFiles</key>\n    <array>\n      <string>AppIcon</string>\n    </array>\n  </dict>\n  <key>CFBundleAlternateIcons</key>\n  <dict>\n    <key>AlternateIcon1</key>\n    <dict>\n      <key>CFBundleIconFiles</key>\n      <array>\n        <string>AlternateIcon1</string>\n      </array>\n    </dict>\n    <!-- Add more alternate icons as needed -->\n  </dict>\n</dict>\n```\n\n#### Android Configuration\n\n1. **Add Alternate Icons**: Create alternate icon resources in the `android/app/src/main/res` directory. Each icon should be placed in the appropriate drawable folder (e.g., `drawable-hdpi`, `drawable-mdpi`).\n\n2. **Manifest Configuration**: No additional configuration is required in the `AndroidManifest.xml` for dynamic icons on Android, as the package handles this internally.\n\n## Using the Package\n\nTo change the app icon, use the `RealFlutter` class provided by the package:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter_dynamic_icon/flutter_dynamic_icon.dart';\n\nclass RealFlutter {\n  Future<void> changeIcon(String iconName) async {\n    bool success = await FlutterDynamicIcon.setAlternateIconName(iconName);\n    if (success) {\n      print(\"App icon changed successfully.\");\n    } else {\n      print(\"Failed to change app icon.\");\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

    "description": "# Boxy Flutter Package: A Comprehensive Overview\n\nThe Boxy package for Flutter is a powerful tool designed to provide advanced layout capabilities beyond the standard widgets available in Flutter. It allows developers to create complex, custom layouts with ease, offering flexibility and control over the positioning and sizing of child widgets.\n\n## When to Use Boxy\n\nBoxy is particularly useful in scenarios where the default layout widgets like `Column`, `Row`, or `Stack` fall short. For instance, if you need to create a layout where widgets overlap in a non-linear fashion or require dynamic resizing based on content, Boxy can be a perfect fit. It is ideal for:\n\n- Creating custom layouts that require precise control over child widget positioning.\n- Building responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.\n- Implementing complex UI components that need custom alignment and spacing.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Custom Layouts**: Define your own layout logic to position and size child widgets.\n- **Flexibility**: Easily adapt layouts to different screen sizes and orientations.\n- **Performance**: Optimized for performance, ensuring smooth and responsive UIs.\n- **Ease of Use**: Intuitive API that integrates seamlessly with existing Flutter widgets.",
    "tutorial": "# Setting Up and Using the Boxy Package\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the Boxy package in a Flutter project and demonstrate how to use it to create custom layouts.\n\n## Setup Process\n\n1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the Boxy package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n   ```yaml\n   dependencies:\n     flutter:\n       sdk: flutter\n     boxy: ^0.1.0\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependency.\n\n3. **Import the Package**: In your Dart file, import the Boxy package:\n\n   ```dart\n   import 'package:boxy/boxy.dart';\n   ```\n\n## Platform-Specific Details\n\n### Android\n\nNo additional configuration is required for Android. Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support all Boxy features.\n\n### iOS\n\nFor iOS, ensure that your deployment target is set to iOS 9.0 or higher in your `ios/Podfile`:\n\n```ruby\nplatform :ios, '9.0'\n```\n\n## Using Boxy\n\nTo use Boxy, you will typically extend the `BoxyDelegate` class to define custom layout logic. Here's a simple example:\n\n```dart\nclass RealFlutter extends BoxyDelegate {\n  @override\n  Size layout() {\n    // Custom layout logic goes here\n  }\n}\n```",
    "main": "```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:boxy/boxy.dart';\n\n// Main function to run the Flutter app\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\n// Root widget of the application\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'Boxy Demo',\n      theme: ThemeData(\n        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,\n      ),\n      home: HomePage(),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// Home page of the application\nclass HomePage extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(\n        title: Text('Boxy Layout Example'),\n      ),\n      body: Center(\n        child: CustomBoxy(),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// Custom widget using Boxy for layout\nclass CustomBoxy extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Boxy(\n      delegate: RealFlutter(),\n      children: [\n        Positioned(\n          left: 10,\n          top: 10,\n          child: Container(\n            width: 100,\n            height: 100,\n            color: Colors.red,\n          ),\n        ),\n        Positioned(\n          left: 50,\n          top: 50,\n          child: Container(\n            width: 100,\n            height: 100,\n            color: Colors.green,\n          ),\n        ),\n      ],\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// Custom BoxyDelegate to define layout logic\nclass RealFlutter extends BoxyDelegate {\n  @override\n  Size layout() {\n    // Access the children of the Boxy widget\n    final redBox = children[0];\n    final greenBox = children[1];\n\n    // Position the red box\n    redBox.layout(constraints);\n    redBox.position(Offset(10, 10));\n\n    // Position the green box\n    greenBox.layout(constraints);\n    greenBox.position(Offset(50, 50));\n\n    // Return the size of the layout\n    return Size(150, 150);\n  }\n}\n\n// Application Flow Explanation:\n// 1. The `MyApp` widget sets up the MaterialApp and defines the theme and home page.\n// 2. The `HomePage` widget creates a Scaffold with an AppBar and a centered `CustomBoxy` widget.\n// 3. The `CustomBoxy` widget uses the Boxy package to create a custom layout with two positioned containers.\n// 4. The `RealFlutter` class extends `BoxyDelegate` to define the layout logic, positioning the red and green boxes.\n// 5. The layout method positions the boxes and returns the overall size of the layout.\n```\n```"

    "tutorial": "# Setting Up PostgREST in Flutter\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up the `postgrest` package in a Flutter application. We will cover platform-specific configurations for both Android and iOS.\n\n## Step 1: Add Dependencies\n\nFirst, add the `postgrest` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  flutter:\n    sdk: flutter\n  postgrest: ^0.1.0\n```\n\nRun `flutter pub get` to install the package.\n\n## Step 2: Configure Android\n\nFor Android, ensure that your app has internet permissions. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permission:\n\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"/>\n```\n\n## Step 3: Configure iOS\n\nFor iOS, you need to ensure that your app can make network requests. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following:\n\n```xml\n<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>\n<dict>\n  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>\n  <true/>\n</dict>\n```\n\n## Step 4: Initialize PostgREST Client\n\nCreate a new Dart file, `real_flutter.dart`, and initialize the PostgREST client:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:postgrest/postgrest.dart';\n\nclass RealFlutter {\n  final PostgrestClient client;\n\n  RealFlutter(String url)\n      : client = PostgrestClient(url);\n\n  // Additional methods to interact with the API will be added here\n}\n```\n\n## Step 5: Implement CRUD Operations\n\nIn the `RealFlutter` class, implement methods for CRUD operations. For example, to fetch data:\n\n```dart\nFuture<List<dynamic>> fetchData(String table) async {\n  final response = await client.from(table).select().execute();\n  if (response.error == null) {\n    return response.data;\n  } else {\n    throw Exception('Failed to fetch data: ${response.error.message}');\n  }\n}\n```",

    "description": "# Reflectable Flutter Package: An Overview\n\nThe `reflectable` package in Flutter is a powerful tool that provides reflection capabilities in Dart, which are not natively supported due to Dart's tree-shaking compiler. Reflection is the ability of a program to inspect and modify its structure and behavior at runtime. This package is particularly useful when you need to dynamically access class members, invoke methods, or create instances of classes without knowing their types at compile time.\n\n## When to Use Reflectable\n\n- **Dynamic UI Generation**: When building dynamic user interfaces where widget types and properties are determined at runtime.\n- **Serialization/Deserialization**: Automatically converting objects to and from JSON without manually writing boilerplate code.\n- **Dependency Injection**: Creating instances of classes dynamically, which is useful in implementing service locators or dependency injection frameworks.\n- **Testing and Mocking**: Accessing private members or methods for testing purposes.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Class and Instance Mirrors**: Access class metadata and instance properties/methods.\n- **Method Invocation**: Dynamically invoke methods on objects.\n- **Instance Creation**: Create instances of classes at runtime.\n- **Field Access**: Read and write fields dynamically.\n\nThe `reflectable` package is a versatile tool that can significantly reduce boilerplate code and increase the flexibility of your Flutter applications.",

We'll cover platform-specific details for both Android and iOS.\n\n## Setup Process\n\n1. **Add Dependency**: First, add the `reflectable` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.\n\n   ```yaml\n   dependencies:\n     flutter:\n       sdk: flutter\n     reflectable: ^3.0.0\n   ```\n\n2. **Install the Package**: Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.\n\n3. **Create a Reflectable Class**: Define a class that extends `Reflectable` to specify what kinds of reflection you need.\n\n   ```dart\n   import 'package:reflectable/reflectable.dart';\n\n   class RealFlutter extends Reflectable {\n     const RealFlutter() : super(invokingCapability, declarationsCapability);\n   }\n\n   const realFlutter = RealFlutter();\n   ```\n\n4. **Annotate Classes**: Use the `@realFlutter` annotation on classes you want to reflect upon.\n\n   ```dart\n   @realFlutter\n   class MyClass {\n     final String name;\n     MyClass(this.name);\n\n     void sayHello() {\n       print('Hello, $name!');\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Generate Code**: Run the build runner to generate the necessary code for reflection.\n\n   ```bash\n   flutter pub run build_runner build\n   ```\n\n## Platform-Specific Details\n\n- **Android**: Ensure that your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to at least 21 to support reflection capabilities.\n- **iOS**: No specific configurations are required for iOS, but ensure your deployment target is set to a version that supports Dart's reflection capabilities.\n\n## Optimizations\n\n- **Tree Shaking**: The `reflectable` package is designed to work with Dart's tree shaking, but be mindful of the additional code size due to reflection metadata.\n- **Performance**: Reflection can introduce performance overhead. Use it judiciously and profile your app to ensure it meets performance requirements.",

The app initializes Unity Ads with the provided game ID in the main function.\n// 2. The `AdDemoPage` widget is the main screen, which loads a video ad on startup.\n// 3. The `_isAdLoaded` state variable tracks whether the ad is ready to be shown.\n// 4. When the \"Show Video Ad\" button is pressed, `_showAd` is called.\n// 5. `_showAd` checks if the ad is loaded and then displays it using `UnityAds.showVideoAd`.\n// 6. Callback functions handle ad events like completion, failure, start, and click, providing feedback in the console.\n```\n```"
